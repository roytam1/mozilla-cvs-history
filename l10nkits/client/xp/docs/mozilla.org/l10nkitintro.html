<H2>
purpose</H2>
This page details the localization kits that are being made publicly available
as part of the universal localization program. As the program's <A HREF="ulpFAQ.html">FAQ</A>
stated, there are two dimensions to this program: what is permitted versus
what is facilitated. Localization kits are the primary way in which the
universal localization program facilitates translation of the branded Netscape
Communicator Standard Edition and Netscape Navigator products, as well
as the Mozilla product and its derivatives.

<P>A localization kit contains the tools, instructions and resources necessary
to produce a localized version of the target software. Currently, these
kits are derived from the Netscape Communicator Standard Edition and Netscape
Navigator version 4.x products. By following the instructions in the kits,
you will be able to produce a localized client product in any supported
language. By extension, you may be able to apply the tools and information
provided in the localization kits to localize the Mozilla client. Finally,
following this model, we anticipate developers publishing their own localization
kits based on their derivatives of the mozilla.org source code.

<H2>
kit contents</H2>
While the exact contents of each localization kit differs according to
the platform and product it is intended for, each kit is composed of the
following general pieces:
<UL>
<LI>
The English language resources (in exportable, binary form)</LI>

<LI>
Localization notes</LI>

<LI>
Kit documentation</LI>

<LI>
Tools</LI>
</UL>

<DT>
<B>Resources</B></DT>

<DD>
The English language resources are provided as the base for your localization
work. These resources will match the version used to generate the localization
notes. For Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh platforms, the English
language resources are provided as binaries. (You may also download a later
version of the product by visiting Netscape's <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/download/index.html">download
pages</A>. Be sure you only localize the <B><I>export</I></B> version!
Otherwise, you will not be able to legally distribute your localized product.)
Netscape's experience with localization has convinced us that localizing
resource binaries is more efficient than working on source files (at least
on Windows and Macintosh).</DD>

<P>
<DT>
<B>Localization notes</B></DT>

<DD>
Localization notes are the heart of the kits: this is where you will find
detailed information on the exact way in which particularly sensitive resources
must be handled. For example, the localization notes tell you which resources
must not be changed from their original values; they will also identify
resources that appear as HTML or Javascript, or that must match other resources
in order for the product to function properly.</DD>

<P>
<DT>
<B>Documentation</B></DT>

<DD>
The localization kit documentation is a series of HTML files which give
you an overview of the localization process, as well as generic instructions
on localizing the different data types found in the product.</DD>

<P>
<DT>
<B>Tools</B></DT>

<DD>
We have attempted to make our Localization Kits "tools agnostic," meaning
you are free to use whichever localization tools you desire to accomplish
your aims. At the same time, we have chosen to release some of our internally
developed localization tools; these are provided "as is", with no support
(but we use them daily with great success).</DD>
