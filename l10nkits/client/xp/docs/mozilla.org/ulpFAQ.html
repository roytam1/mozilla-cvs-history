<P>Netscape's universal localization program furthers the goals of mozilla.org by 
publishing tools and documentation to aid developers who wish to localize Mozilla.  In addition,
participants in the universal localization program may freely translate the Netscape Navigator 
and Netscape Communicator Standard Edition version 4.x.  These localized products may be freely distributed under
the participant's branding. 
<P>

<LI>
<B>What is Localization?</B></LI>

<BR>Localization is the process of adapting software for a specific international market; 
this process includes translating the user interface, resizing dialog boxes, replacing icons
and other culturally sensitive graphics (if necessary), customizing features (if necessary), 
and testing the localized product to ensure that the program still works.

<P><A NAME="2"></A>
<LI>
<B>How does the universal localization program relate to mozilla.org?</B></LI>

<BR>The universal localization program is an extension of the philosophy
behind mozilla.org. The goal of the program is to enable developers on the
Internet to freely localize and distribute products based on the Netscape
client and on derivatives based on the mozilla.org source. mozilla.org
will host the content for this program, and provide a forum for developers
to correspond on their work.

<P><A NAME="3"></A>
<LI>
<B>How does the universal localization program relate to the unlimited distribution program?</B></LI>

<BR>Whereas the unlimited distribution program allows you to
freely distribute Netscape Navigator and Netscape Communicator
Standard Edition client binaries, and to make slight modifications to these products,
the universal localization program allows you to create localized,
independently branded versions of these products.  You may then distribute these localized
products according to the terms of the License.

<P><A NAME="4"></A>
<LI>
<B>What are the terms of the universal localization program's License?</B></LI>

<BR>We are still working out some of the details of the License Agreement
under which this program will be administered.  References to the License Agreement in 
this document are, therefore, regrettably vague.  We hope to have this ironed out soon.

<P><A NAME="5"></A>
<LI>
<B>What products may I localize?</B></LI>

<BR>You may localize the Netscape Navigator, Netscape Communicator Standard
Edition, or any client based on the Mozilla source code available from mozilla.org (or its
mirror sites).
Note that localizing products not directly documented in the localization
kits probably will be more difficult than localizing those that are directly documented.


<P><A NAME="6"></A>
<LI>
<B>Who should participate in the universal localization program?</B></LI>

<BR>This program is intended for professional software localizers, localization engineers, 
or others who are knowledgeable in software localization concepts and techniques. 
However, if you are familiar with common tools, such as resource editors, and if you 
are fluent in a particular language, you could use the tools and information provided by 
this program to localize Navigator or Communicator in your language.

<P><A NAME="7"></A>
<LI>
<B>Where can I distribute the localized version?</B></LI>

<BR>The terms of the License do not change due to translation of the software: 
you may distribute localized versions of the Netscape branded binaries anywhere
allowed by the export license. (A copy of this license comes with every Netscape product).
For localized Mozilla product derivatives, you may distribute them anywhere allowable under 
the final free source License (whatever that turns out to be).

<P><A NAME="8"></A>
<LI>
<B>How much does this cost?</B></LI>

<BR>There is no cost to participate in the universal localization program.

<P><A NAME="9"></A>
<LI>
<B>Am I allowed to use the Netscape brand, trademarks and logo?</B></LI>

<BR>You may not use the name "Netscape" nor the "N" logo
in your localized product. However, you may use the trademarks "Navigator,"
"Communicator," "Messenger," "Collabra", and the "Ship's Wheel icon".  The universal 
localization program License will give you the exact legal details.

<P><A NAME="10"></A>
<LI>
<B>Will there be any end user support from Netscape for my finished product?</B></LI>

<BR>No. The products derived from the mozilla.org source and Netscape binaries
are not entitled to Netscape end user support. The level of support you provide 
your end users is up to you to decide.

<P><A NAME="11"></A>
<LI>
<B>Am I required to give my localization back to the Net?</B></LI>

<BR>The terms of the License are not yet set on this issue.

<P><A NAME="12"></A>
<LI>
<B>Can I download software from the general download page on the Netscape
web site and localize it?</B></LI>

<BR>Yes. You may download, localize and distribute any Netscape Navigator
and Netscape Communicator Standard Edition product. However, we may not produce a
localization kit for all versions and platforms. You may try
to use the instructions and tools in the kits we do release for these other versions
and platforms, but successful localization could be quite difficult under these circumstances.

<H3>
T<FONT SIZE=-1>ECHNICAL INFORMATION</FONT></H3>

<P><A NAME="13"></A>
<LI>
<B>What is a localization kit?</B></LI>

<BR>A localization kit contains the tools, instructions and resources necessary
to produce a localized version of a specific software product. The
detailed instructions contained in a given localization kit are usually
specific to a single platform and/or version of a product. These instructions
may, however, be broadly applicable to more than one version or platform.
Therefore, when we say a localization kit "supports" a given platform,
version or language, what we mean is that kit contains detailed instructions
that directly apply to that platform or version or language. It may
be possible to use a localization kit for one platform to successfully
localize another. On the other hand, it may be quite difficult.

<P><A NAME="14"></A>
<LI>
<B>Why do I need a localization kit?</B></LI>

<BR>The primary goal of a localization kit is to convey information about
the product being localized so that the over-translation of restricted
resources does not occur. Over-translation occurs when a resource changes
that must not be changed. It can also occur when a resource must be changed
in a particular way, but is not done so. In both cases, the product may
not function properly or may cease to function at all (e.g. crash). The
information contained in the localization kits is designed to help
avoid these situations and to help you correctly localize the product.
Attempting to translate the source files directly without such a kit could
be a frustrating and error-prone operation.

<P><A NAME="15"></A>
<LI>
<B>What platforms does this program support?</B></LI>

<BR>This question has two dimensions: what platforms are permissible versus what platforms 
are made easy for me to localize onto.  The first issue is addressed by the program, the second, 
by the localization kits.
<P>
The universal localization program allows you to create and distribute localized 
products for any platform, except Caldera Linux.  Netscape has an exclusive agreement 
with Caldera, so this platform is off the list.
<P>
Localization kits are currently planned for Windows (32 bit) and Macintosh platforms. 
Windows 16 bit and Unix localization kits are not available at this time.  You are welcome to 
try to localize the software for any platform (except Caldera Linux), with or without the benefit of 
a localization kit (but doing so without will be harder than with).

<P><A NAME="16"></A>
<LI>
<B>Into what languages can I translate the software?</B></LI>

<BR>This is the same issue as above: under the universal localization program, you are free 
to localize the product into any language you desire.  On the other hand, not every language
is fully supported by current (version 4.x) client software.  In general, if the target language you desire 
is supported by one of the encodings listed in the Navigator's View | Encoding menu,
localization into that language should be successful. This is because parts of the product's 
user interface is HTML, which depends on the encoding support built into the HTML rendering 
engine to display properly.
<P>
You will need an operating system that also supports that language. This is because the fonts 
necessary to display the standard (non-HTML) localized resources, as well as the input methods, 
keyboard mappings, etc., required to input your language's characters, are provided by the 
OS.
<P>
Please note that at this time, Communicator does not support bidirectional languages, such 
as Arabic and Hebrew, nor languages with complex scripts, such as Devanagari. Languages 
with contextual line breaking algorithms, such as Thai, are also not supported (although 
partial localization and display of web pages may still be possible through various means).
<P>
To provide support for additional languages, you will be able modify the 5.x source
code which will be distributed by mozilla.org.

<P><A NAME="17"></A>
<LI>
<B>How can I get technical assistance?</B></LI>

<BR>There is no formal technical support; you are on your own. However,
we expect that you will find the newsgroups and mailing lists hosted on
mozilla.org to be a valuable resource. You can find the list of newsgroups
by going to the mozilla.org <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/community.html">Community</A> pages:
 http://www.mozilla.org/community.html

<P><A NAME="18"></A>
<LI>
<B>I understand that the source code distributed by mozilla.org will not
include certain 3rd-party components or cryptography. If I localize
Netscape Navigator 4.x, will I lose the ability to use those components?</B></LI>

<BR>No. Since the localization process does not depend on having
the source code to the program available (all you are doing, really, is
changing strings in an existing executable) you will retain all of the
functionality present in the executable you started with. It will
just be in a different language.

<P><A NAME="19"></A>
<LI>
<B>Will this work for Communicator Professional Edition components?</B></LI>

<BR>No. The Professional Edition includes 3rd Party components that are
not covered by the Unlimited Distribution or NPL programs. These
components cannot be modified under this program.

<P><A NAME="20"></A>
<LI>
<B>What about products in France?</B></LI>

<BR>You are free to create French versions.  However, to comply with French law, 
if you distribute a product which has cryptographic 
capabilities, that product must use the special encryption level for France.
Compliant versions of Communicator and Navigator are available from Netscape's 
download page. The English Export version of Netscape Navigator
and Netscape Communicator Standard Edition are not authorized for import
into France. 
<P>
Netscape's download page can be found

<P><A NAME="21"></A>
<LI>
<B>What Spell Checkers can I use?</B></LI>

<BR>The spell checker module built into Composer is licensed from Inso
Software. Inso permits you to bundle two spell checkers with
your product. For additional spell check dictionaries, contact Inso Corporation.

<P><A NAME="22"></A>
<LI>
<B>What about Installers?</B></LI>

<BR>Currently, Netscape's installer programs are built using 3rd party
modules, for which we do not have redistribution rights. Therefore,
we are not releasing a complete installer kit; however, guidelines for
creating your own installer will be available. You may use any commercially
available installer software to package your localized product and obtain
authorization for distribution directly from the provider of the installer
software.</OL>
