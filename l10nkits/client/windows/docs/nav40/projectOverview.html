<CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#009900">Welcome to the Netscape Communicator/Navigator
Localization Kit!</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>This localization kit will assist you in creating a localized version
of Netscape Communicator or Navigator for the 32-bit Windows platform.
Using the instructions and optionally, the tools provided in this kit,
you can translate the product's menus, dialogs and error messages to the
language of your choice. As long as you follow the terms of the license
agreement under which this kit is distributed, you are free to do what
you want with the resulting localized product.

<P>Localizing the Netscape client is based on "binary" or "no-compile"localization
model. Instead of localizing resource script (.RC) files, which must be
recompiled to produce a working localized version, you work directly on
the binary resource module (.DLL or .EXE) files. You have access to <I>localization
notes</I> to assist and guide you through some of the trickier areas of
the product.&nbsp; Finally, this kit contains several tools developed by
Netscape to expedited the localization process; however, you may, if you
prefer, work with the localization tools of your choice.

<P>The no-compile localization model offers a number of key benefits over
source file translation:
<UL>
<LI>
A simpler kit environment - no make files or bulky source trees are required.</LI>

<LI>
Leveraging previous translations is simpler when resources can be stored
in a database, decreasing translation time.</LI>

<LI>
"Forbidden" resources can be locked from over-translation, improving the
quality of translated products.</LI>

<BR>Localization notes and instructions can be displayed along side the
actual resource being localized, allowing the translator immediate access
to this information.</UL>
