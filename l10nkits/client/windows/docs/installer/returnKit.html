Once you are satisfied with the quality of your localization efforts, you
are required by the terms of the universal localization program license
agreement to make your localized product publicly available. The exact
details of how you do this is up to you, the most commonly acceptable method
is to post your localized product to a publicly accessible ftp site.

<P>You should post just the localized versions of the files mentioned in
the Localize These Files section of this document. For ease of transfer,
you may create a compressed archive in the .ZIP file format that contains
the localized files. Create one .ZIP file for each language/platform you
do. If you are publishing more than one language or platform, you may combine
multiple .ZIP files into one master .ZIP file if this makes your life easier.

<P>If your localized product includes your own trademarks, you should identify
these and any restrictions you are placing on their use. You must also
include a copy of the End User License Agreement (EULA), as well as a notice
stating that Netscape Communications is not required to support your product,
and that you are the Licensor referred to in the EULA. Please refer to
the Universal Localization Agreement for the exact legal requirements.

<P>Once your localized product is publicly available, you may inform the
world in any manner you choose, but we encourage you to also post the download
location to the mozilla.org Announcements newsgroup (netscape.public.mozilla.announce).
