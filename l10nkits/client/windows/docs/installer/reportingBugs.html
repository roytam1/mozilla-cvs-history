<A NAME="reporting_bugs"></A>Reporting Bugs</H3>
Any bugs in the localization kits you find should be reported to <A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org">mozilla.org</A>
as soon as possible. When you report a bug, try to be as specific as you
can about the exact steps needed to reproduce the bug.&nbsp; Provide a
complete description of the problem versus the expected results.&nbsp;
You should let us know if the problem is 100% reproducible (it happens
every time), or if it is intermittant.&nbsp; If you think that your operating
environment may play some factor, let us know the details of that.&nbsp;
Finally, before reporting any bug, you should make sure that the problem
doesn't also happen in the US English product (if it does, we still want
to know, but it may not be possible to fix it through the localization
kits or tools as they are now).

<P>To report a bug, post a message to the following mozilla.org newsgroup:
