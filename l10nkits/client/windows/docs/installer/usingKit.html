<A NAME="usekit"></A>3. Using the Kit</H2>
Once your copy of the Windows Installer Localization Kit is correctly installed,
you may begin your localization work by following the instructions in the
remainder of this document. The next section discusses the contents of
the localization notes provided with this kit. It is important that you
work properly with the instructions contained in these files or the localized
product you create may not function.
<H3>
<A NAME="locdbf"></A>Understanding the Localization Notes</H3>
Each localized module to be installed has an associated initialization
(.INI) file. The localization notes for these files, and for the localizable
dynamic link libraries used by the InstallShield installer, are provided
as HTML documentation. (There are no localization databases in this kit).
Additionally, a section detailing the required Windows registry settings
is also provided in HTML format.

<P>The next section presents the basic localization process as a checklist.
<CENTER>
<HR WIDTH="50%"></CENTER>

<H3>
<A NAME="l10nchecklist"></A>Localization Checklist</H3>
This checklist applies to the "<A HREF="kitOverview.html#method1">modifying
an existing Communicator installer</A>" method. If you are <A HREF="kitOverview.html#method2">creating
your own installer</A>, you will need to adapt this checklist accordingly.
A reference is provided to help you implement the correct <A HREF="registrySettings.html">Windows
registry settings</A>.

<P><B>1. Download an existing installer</B>
<BR>You will need a matching installer for the product you are localizing.
In other words, if you are localizing Netscape Communicator version 4.03,
you need an installer for the Export version of Netscape Communicator 4.03.
If you are localizing Mozilla Navigator version 5.0, you need an installer
for the Export version (if any) of Mozilla Navigator version 5.0. Latest
versions of Netscape products can be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://home.netscape.com/download/index.html">Netscape
homepage</A>. Older versions of Netscape installers, matching the versions
used to generate the localization kits, can be found on the <A HREF="ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/l10n-kits/">mozilla.org
ftp site</A>.

<P>Current Netscape installers come in two forms: base and complete. Complete
installers include plugins and other components besides the basic Communicator
software. You may use either installer as the foundation for your work,
but note that there may not be localization kits for the additional components.
Even if you choose to distribute the English version of these components,
however, you must modify the associated initialization files, listed in
the <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table1">Localize These Files</A>
page in order for the additional components to be installed properly.

<P><B>2. Uncompress the Installer files</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Run the installer you downloaded in step 1. This will bring up the following
dialog (or something very similar):</LI>

<BR><IMG SRC="Is1.jpg" HEIGHT=101 WIDTH=364>
<LI>
Click yes. InstallShield will extract all the installation files to your
temporary directory. (Usually, this will be C:\temp or something similar).
Once this process is complete, the blue InstallShield background will display.</LI>

<LI>
Without exiting the installer, locate the unpacked installer files in your
temp directory and copy them to a new directory. Call this directory "install"
(or something similar).</LI>

<LI>
Exit the installer.</LI>
</UL>
<B>3. Uncompress the Deinstaller files</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Change directories to your "install" directory. Locate the file cd32*.exe
(where * equals the version number you are working on. For example, version
4.03 would be represented as cd32403.exe).</LI>

<LI>
Execute cd32*.exe. This will bring up a dialog similar to the one shown
is step 2. Click yes and wait until InstallShield has finished unpacking
the deinstaller files (the blue InstallShield background will display).</LI>

<LI>
Without exiting the installer, locate the unpacked deinstaller files in
your temp directory and copy them to a new directory. Call this directory
"deinstall" (or something similar).</LI>

<LI>
Exit the installer.</LI>
</UL>
<B>4. Extract localizable installer .DLLs</B>
<BR>Change directories to your "install" directory. Use the InstallShield
tool ICOMP.EXE to extract RSUTIL.DLL and _ISUSER.DLL from _SETUP.LIB:
<UL><TT>Example: icomp _setup.lib -d</TT></UL>
<B>4. Localize files</B>
<BR>Consult the <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table1">Localize These
Files</A> page to learn which files contain localizable resources.

<P>For each file to be localized, locate the associated Localization Notes
for that file and follow them carefully.

<P><B>5. Replace original product files contained in nav40.z with localized
product files</B>
<BR>Use the ICOMP tool to replace the original (English language) Communicator
or Navigator files with the ones you have localized using the Windows Front
End Localization Kit.
<UL>
<LI>
Make sure your localized product directory structure matches the structure
inside the compressed file nav40.z. (If necessary, uncompress nav40.z (including
subdirectories), and replace all the localizable files (as identified by
the Windows Front End Localization Kit) with your localized versions).</LI>

<LI>
Update nav40.z with your localized files:</LI>

<UL><TT>Example: icomp \<I>kitRoot</I>\products\client\windows\<I>platform</I>\<I>locale</I>\*.*
nav40.z -i</TT></UL>
</UL>
<B>6. Rebuild the self-extracting deinstaller program</B>
<BR>Use the InstallShield tool EXE Builder to reassemble the self-extracting
deinstaller archive.
<UL>
<LI>
Specify your "deinstall" directory as the source directory.</LI>

<LI>
Set compression on.</LI>

<LI>
Specify Setup.exe as the command line program to run when self-extraction
is complete. (No optional parameters are required.)</LI>

<LI>
Specify your "install" directory as the target directory.</LI>

<LI>
Enter the name of your localized product as the application name.</LI>

<LI>
Do not specify a password.</LI>

<LI>
Once creation of your localized self-extracting deinstaller is complete,
locate the file Setupex.exe in your "install" directory and rename it to
match the original name of the deinstaller self-extracting program (e.g.,
cd32403.exe).</LI>
</UL>
<B>7. Rebuild the self-extracting installer program</B>
<BR>Use the InstallShield tool EXE Builder to reassemble the self-extracting
installer archive.
<UL>
<LI>
Specify your "install" directory as the source directory.</LI>

<LI>
Set compression on.</LI>

<LI>
Specify Setup.exe as the command line program to run when self-extraction
is complete. (No optional parameters are required.)</LI>

<LI>
Specify any directory you want as the target directory.</LI>

<LI>
Enter the name of your localized product as the application name.</LI>

<LI>
Do not specify a password.</LI>

<LI>
Once creation of your localized self-extracting installer is complete,
locate the file Setupex.exe in your target directory and rename it to something
meaningful.</LI>
</UL>
<B>8. Complete post-translation processing</B>
<BR>After translation is complete, you need to test your work and deal
with any problems:
<UL>
<LI>
Test the localized installer.</LI>

<LI>
Fix translation bugs using your localization tools or a resource editor.</LI>

<LI>
Fix dialog size bugs using your localization tools or a resource editor.</LI>

<LI>
Report core bugs to Netscape.</LI>
</UL>
<B>9. Publish your localized product to the Internet</B>
<BR>As the terms of the universal localization program license agreement
state, your localized product

<P><TT>"must be made publicly available in executable code form,</TT>
<BR><TT>free of charge, for electronic delivery via a mechanism</TT>
<BR><TT>generally accepted in the software development</TT>
<BR><TT>community."</TT>

<P>In plain English, this means you should post your localized product
on a publicly accessible http: or ftp: server. You may also want to send
an announcement of your product's availability to mozilla.org (though you
are not required to do so).

<A NAME="howtol10n"></A>How to Localize Different Resource Types</H2>
This section provides you with general information about localizing the
various resource types and files found with this kit.
<H3>
<A NAME="localize_text"></A>Localizing .INI Files</H3>

<UL>Most of the work for the Windows installers is localizing initialization
(.INI) files. You may use the text editor of your choice to do this work.
Be sure the localized files are saved as plain text only.
<H4>
<A NAME="locnote_ini"></A>Localization Notes</H4>
Individual localization notes for the installer .INI files are contained
in the individual HTML documents linked from the <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table1">Localize
These Files</A> page.</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localizeURLs"></A>Localizing URLs</H3>

<UL>You will not likely encounter any URLs (Universal Resource Locators)
in the installers, but if you do, how they are localized depends on whether
you are creating a branded Netscape version or not. The rules for how to
handle URLs are found <A HREF="localizeURL.html">here</A>.</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_stringtable"></A>Localizing String Tables</H3>

<UL>Use the resource editor of your choice to localize STRINGTABLE resources.
These are the most sensitive, potentially problematic resource type you
will be working with. Therefore, you must pay close attention to the instructions
provided in the localization notes.
<H4>
<A NAME="locnote_stringtable"></A>Localization Notes</H4>
Individual localization notes for the installer resource .DLLs are contained
in the individual HTML documents linked from the <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table1">Localize
These Files</A> page. This section gives you some additional general guidelines
to follow when localizing the installer binary files.
<UL>
<LI>
Some strings may contain C++ print format strings, such as %s, %ld, %lu,
etc. Do not modify these while translating the rest of the string.</LI>

<LI>
Some strings may contain new line characters: \n. In general, you should
try leave these as you find them.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_menus"></A>Localizing Menus</H3>

<UL>There are no menu resources in the Windows installer</UL>

<H3>
<A NAME="localize_dialogs"></A>Localizing Dialogs</H3>

<UL>Use the resource editor of your choice to localize and resize DIALOG
resources. Dialog translation is usually not as tricky as localizing string
tables; however, you should take care to assign unique pickletters to dialog
controls.
<H4>
<A NAME="locnote_menus"></A>Localization Notes</H4>
</UL>

<UL>Individual localization notes for the installer resource .DLLs are
contained in the individual HTML documents linked from the <A HREF="localize_these_files.html#table1">Localize
