<CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#009900">Welcome to the Communicator/Navigator
Installer Localization Kit!</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>Under the universal localization program, you are free to create an
installer for a localized Communicator, Navigator or Mozilla derivative
product in any way you choose. This localization kit will assist you in
creating a your installer for the 32-bit Windows platform. As long as you
follow the terms of the universal localization program license agreement,
you are free to do what you want with the resulting localized product and
installer.

<P>The Netscape Communicator and Netscape Navigator 4.x installation programs
were created with InstallShield<SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>&reg;</FONT></SUP> version
3.&nbsp; Because this is the proprietary product of InstallShield Corporation,
Netscape cannot redistribute the complete source for these installers.&nbsp;
You may, however, modify an existing Communicator or Navigator installer,
or if you choose, you may build your own installer "from scratch".

<P><B>Note</B>: because of the U.S. Government's restrictions on the export
of strong cryptography, <B>you may only distribute the "export" version</B>
of the Netscape binaries.&nbsp; Please keep this in mind as you work with
the localization kit instructions.
