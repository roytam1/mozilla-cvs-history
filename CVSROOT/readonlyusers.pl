# This is a simple script that forces specified users to
# have read-only access to the CVS repository when using SSH.
# This must be done in a pre-commit check script, as SSH users
# must have an account on the server with access to the repository.
# Returning "0" means the account is allowed to check-in. Any other
# return type will stop the commit from occurring.

# To make it work, you need to add the script name to
# CVSROOT/checkoutlist so that the script is checked out correctly
# on the CVS server.
# Also, you need to add a line to your
# CVSROOT/commitinfo file that says something like:
#
#      ALL	$CVSROOT/CVSROOT/readonlyusers.pl
