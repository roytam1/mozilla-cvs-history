<!-- Localization note: The default intro text has 3 "inserts":
        #1 - replaced with the descriptive text that describes the mime type
             (e.g., "MSWord Document")
        #2 - replaced with the mime type (e.g., "application/ms-word")
        #3 - replaced with the url path (e.g., "http://www.foo.com/bar/")
     If there is no descriptive text, then the alternative text is used which
     has only inserts #2 and #3.
