David, I completely agree. But unless we have a clear design model for
how hiking works, we're going to get asked to put random buttons on Yosemite.
We've been there. I just want to make sure we get the requirements met
while designing a predictable UI.

Mike, I agree that the features shouldn't interfere with the UI. And the
last thing I want the UI to have to do is be contorted to accommodate Yellowstone!

<P>However, we do need a design that is more scalable than what we currently
have and helps drives traffic and membership to Yellowstone without impacting
the user experience. 

<P>This is why it is important to get a requirements document distributed
and approved.

<P>--Lori</HTML>
