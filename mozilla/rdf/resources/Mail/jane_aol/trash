Guha,
<P>Do you have a Aurora build better then Flaky?&nbsp; I'm showing some
of this stuff to Clinton tomorrow at 11am, and it would be nice to
have a build that works better by 10:30a (when I have a different meeting).
<P>I'll be OK with Flaky if you don't have time, or if you can't just point
me to it and let me take care of setting it up.
<P>Thanks,
<P>John</HTML>

Reported by: glynn

Old Status:  >> New Status: REOPENED  
Old Priority:  >> New Priority: P0 
Old Severity:  >> New Severity: critical  
Resolution: FIXED 

Summary: lower case "netscape" fails DNS on Internet Keyword lookup 
Description: Could be server, could be app..not sure yet
Aug 6 4.06 builds
PPC, NT 4.0, UNIX IRIX 6.3

1.  Launch Communicator with direct connection set in proxies:prefs (default) 
into a browser window.
2.  Enter precisely "netscape" into the location field and hit return.

•  DNS failure to find server alert will present itself.

If keywords are off std DNS works fine on "netscape"....if on the problem 
continues...only lower case "netscape" fails

Wiping out pref files does not help/new profile does not help

*******One clue...when I was routed through "ducky" at 8288 last night my NT 4.0 
would work where ernie's NT 4.0 with direct connect failed...when I turned my 
machine back to direct connect it failed...cannot check ducky right now because 
it is out due to power outage.

Summary:   Direct connect set in proxy prefs

"netscape"  -  FAILS

"Netscape" works
"Netscape Communications" works
"netscape communications" works

Steve Dagley investigating....has clue as to where in code problem 
lies...talking to valeski....assign to sdagley...reassign as needed


------- Additional Comments From sdagley  08/07/98 18:17 ------- 

After looking at the code and discussing things with valeski and guha the problem 
is understood and the fix simple.  Reassigning to guha since he'll be making the 
fix on valeski's machine.


------- Additional Comments From valeski  08/07/98 19:34 ------- 

checked in fix 8/7/98 7:35pm into 4.06 tree

------- Additional Comments From varada  08/09/98 15:16 ------- 

I tried the builds on the 9th - on the win nt and win 98 ( there were no other 
new builds on the unix platform ) and while netscape works - netscape.com and 
http://netscape.com fails and Netscape.com and http://Netscape.com throws up 
server not found - dns entry not there 

------- Additional Comments From kenh  08/10/98 09:51 ------- 

The failure to resolve netscape.com and http://netscape.com is independent of 
the Keyword system. Both are fully qualified URLs (the first because Nav adds 
the protocol), so they are resolved directly, but are not found because they are 
not registered domains or aliases to www.netscape.com or home.netscape.com.

------- Additional Comments From varada  08/10/98 12:08 ------- 

This is more of a comment for future improvements rather than reopening the bug 
- I tried the pages of microsoft,oracle,sun,intel,yahoo etc., etc.. and all of 
them seem to have registered or made an alias of their "[company].com" - I think 
it would make sense for us to also do so and not blame it on the existence or 
non existence of the IK preferences - cuz the end
