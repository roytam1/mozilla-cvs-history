/*

  The RDF service interface. This is a singleton object, and should be
  obtained from the <tt>nsServiceManager</tt>.

  XXX I'm not particularly happy with the current APIs for named data
  sources. The idea is that you want "rdf:bookmarks" to always map to
  the "bookmarks" data store. The thing that bothers me now is that
  the implementation has to pre-load all of the data sources: that
  means you need to parse the bookmarks file, read the history, etc.,
  rather than doing this on-demand. With a little thought, it may be
  able to enormously improve these APIs so that pre-loading data
  sources is unnecessary.
