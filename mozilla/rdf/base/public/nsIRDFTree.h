/*
  An interface for presenting a tree view of an rdf datasource (or
  database).

  Any datasource can also support nsIRDFTree. The interface is purely
  syntactic sugar for traversing simple tree where the child relation
  corresponds to the property type nc:child (nc = http://home.netscape.com/NC-rdf#).
  Each leaf is assumed to have a certain predefined set of properties
  such as creationDate, size, lastModificationDate, lastVisitDate, etc.

  This interface is substantially less general than nsIRDFDataSource,
  but is adequate for bookmarks, the file system, history and a few
  other very commonly used data sources.
