Sparkle is an MIT-like-licensed framework used for Camino's auto-update
functionality. See http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org/ for more information about
Sparkle. The Sparkle framework is shipped inside Camino's bundle, and some glue
code is included in Camino itself.

This is based on trunk r52 of Sparkle:
svn co -r52 http://code.andymatuschak.org/sparkle/trunk Sparkle
with the changes described in bug 403273 to allow building for 10.3.
