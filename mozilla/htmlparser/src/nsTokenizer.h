/**
 * MODULE NOTES:
 * LAST MODS:	gess 28Feb98
 * 
 * This file declares the basic tokenizer class. The 
 * central theme of this class is to control and 
 * coordinate a tokenization process. Note that this 
 * class is grammer-neutral: this class doesn't care
 * at all what the underlying stream consists of. 
 *
 * The main purpose of this class is to iterate over an
 * input stream with the help of a given scanner and a
 * given type-specific tokenizer-Delegate.
 *
 * The primary method here is the tokenize() method, which
 * simple loops calling getToken() until an EOF condition
 * (or some other error) occurs.
