/**
 * MODULE NOTES:
 * @update  gess 4/1/98
 * 
 * This virtual base class is used to define the basic
 * tokenizer delegate interface. As you can see, it is
 * very simple.
 *
 * The only routines we use at this point are getToken() 
 * and willAddToken(). While getToken() is obvious, 
 * willAddToken() may not be. The purpose of the method
 * is to allow the delegate to decide whether or not a 
 * given token that was just read in the tokenization process
 * should be included in the total list of tokens. This
 * method gives you a chance to say, "No, ignore this token".
