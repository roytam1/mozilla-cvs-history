Snapshots of cairo and libpixman for mozilla usage.  Where possible,
these should be official releases from the cairo project as-is.  If
changes are necessary, they should be documented below and the patch
file included in this directory.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.

VERSIONS:

  cairo 0.5.0
  libpixman 0.1.5

PATCHES:

  stdint.h - select between inttypes.h, stdint.h, and mozstdint.h.

  dash-dos.diff - prevent DOS attack with dasharray.

  alphablend.diff - check for AlphaBlend usability at runtime (win32)

  feature-tests.diff - change #if to #ifdef, and change
      cairo-features.h.in to #define things based on mozilla configure
      tests

  allow-null-surface.diff - allow creating a cairo_t with a NULL
      target surface

  optimize-opaque-paint.diff - if cairo_paint_with_alpha is called
      with alpha == 1.0, turn it into cairo_paint

      (upstream patch)
