Snapshots of cairo and libpixman for mozilla usage.  Where possible,
these should be official releases from the cairo project as-is.  If
changes are necessary, they should be documented below and the patch
file included in this directory.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.

VERSIONS:

  cairo 1.0.0

***** NOTE FOR VISUAL C++ 6.0 *****

VC6 cannot build pixman correctly for various reasons.  There is a static
win32 pixman library provided in libpixman/src/pixman-vc71.lib that will
be used instead of building on all Win32/Visual C++ builds.  Building with
VC7.1, gcc/mingw, or anything else other than VC6 is fine.

PATCHES:

  stdint.h - select between inttypes.h, stdint.h, and mozstdint.h.

  feature-tests.diff - change #if to #ifdef, and change
      cairo-features.h.in to #define things based on mozilla configure
      tests
