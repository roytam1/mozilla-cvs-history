Snapshots of cairo and glitz for mozilla usage.  Where possible,
these should be official releases from the cairo project as-is.  If
changes are necessary, they should be documented below and the patch
file included in this directory.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.

VERSIONS:

  cairo 1.1.1 (cvs - 2006-02-02)
  glitz 0.5.2 (cvs - 2006-01-10)

***** NOTE FOR VISUAL C++ 6.0 *****

VC6 cannot build pixman from cairo.  Therefore, VC6 builds are not supported
if cairo is enabled.  Please upgrade to VC7.1/8.

==== Patches ====

mozilla-misc.patch
  - Misc compilation fixes for pixman (submitted upstream)
  - temporary moz_cairo_set_target API (not for upstream)
  - mac compilation fix for cairo-atsui-font.c for 10.2 SDK (maybe should
    be upstream?)
  - cairo-features.h.in - add cairo-platform.h include and hard-code the
    cairo version (not for upstream)
  - #if 0'ing out DllMain in win32-surface.c -- not needed, since
    we don't use cairo multithreaded, and DllMain interferes
    with libxul's DllMain. (not for usptream)
  - #if 0'ing out bits to get rid of multithreaded stuff in cairoint.h
    (not for upstream)

cairo-debug-helpers.patch
  - some stuff for cairo-debug.[ch]

  - Rework win32 surface clip and extents handling for correctness
    (submitted upstream)

device-offset-scale.path
  - Move device offset/scale handling into surface layer; large rework
    of device offset/scale.  (submitted upstream)
