Snapshots of cairo and glitz for mozilla usage.  Where possible,
these should be official releases from the cairo project as-is.  If
changes are necessary, they should be documented below and the patch
file included in this directory.

We only include the relevant parts of each release (generally, src/*.[ch]),
as we have Makefile.in's that integrate into the Mozilla build system.  For
documentation and similar, please see the official tarballs at
http://www.cairographics.org/.

VERSIONS:

  cairo 1.1.1 (cvs - 2006-01-10)
  glitz 0.5.2 (cvs - 2006-01-10)

***** NOTE FOR VISUAL C++ 6.0 *****

VC6 cannot build pixman from cairo.  Therefore, VC6 builds are not supported
if cairo is enabled.  Please upgrade to VC7.1/8.
