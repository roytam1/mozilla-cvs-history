Snapshots of cairo and libpixman for mozilla usage.  Where possible,
these should be official releases from the cairo project as-is.  If
changes are necessary, they should be documented below and the patch
file included in this directory.

VERSIONS:

  cairo 0.3.0
  libpixman 0.1.3

PATCHES:

  quartz-surface.diff - quartz backend get/set surface behave
    differently than cairo expects, so partially transparent objects
    tend to blend towards opaque the more that is drawn.  Short term
    inefficient workaround of clearing the buffer on each set.
