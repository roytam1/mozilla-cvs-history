/* 
    The nsICoolURL class is an interface to the URL behaviour. 
    This follows the URL spec at-
    
         http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/url-spec.txt
    
    For the purpose of this class, here is the most elaborate form of a URL
    and its corresponding parts-
    
         ftp://username:password@hostname:portnumber/pathname
         \ /   \               / \      / \        /\       /
          -     ---------------   ------   --------  -------
          |            |             |        |         |
          |            |             |        |        Path
          |            |             |       Port         
          |            |            Host
          |         PreHost            
        Scheme

    The URL class extends the URI behaviour by providing a mechanism 
    for consumers to retreive (and on protocol specific levels put) documents
    defined by the URI.
