/* 
    The nsHTTPHandler class is an example implementation of how a 
    pluggable protocol would be written by an external party. As 
    an example this class also uses the Proxy interface.

    Since this is a completely different process boundary, I am 
    keeping this as a singleton. It doesn't have to be that way.

    Currently this is being built with the Netlib dll. But after
    the registration stuff that DP is working on gets completed 
    this will move to the HTTP lib.
