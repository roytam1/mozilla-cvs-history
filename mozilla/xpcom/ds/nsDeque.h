/**
 * MODULE NOTES:
 * @update  gess 4/15/98 (tax day)
 * 
 * The Deque is a very small, very efficient container object
 * than can hold elements of type void*, offering the following features:
 *    It's interface supports pushing and poping of children.
 *    It can iterate (via an interator class) it's children.
 *    When full, it can efficently resize dynamically.
 *
 *
 * NOTE: The only bit of trickery here is that this deque is
 * built upon a ring-buffer. Like all ring buffers, the first 
 * element may not be at index[0]. The mOrigin member determines 
 * where the first child is. This point is quietly hidden from 
 * customers of this class.
 *
