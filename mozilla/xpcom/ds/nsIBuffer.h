/**
 * nsIBuffer is something that we use to implement pipes (buffered
 * input/output stream pairs). It might be useful to you for other
 * purposes, but if not, oh well.
 *
 * One of the important things to understand about pipes is how
 * they work with respect to EOF and result values. The following
 * table describes:
 *
 *               | empty & not EOF    | full               | reader closed | writer closed                     |
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * buffer Read   | readCount == 0     | readCount == N     | N/A           | readCount == N, return NS_OK -or- |
 * operations    | return WOULD_BLOCK | return NS_OK       |               | readCount == 0, return EOF        |
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * buffer Write  | writeCount == N    | writeCount == 0    | N/A           | assertion!                        | 
 * operations    | return NS_OK       | return WOULD_BLOCK |               |                                   |
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * input stream  | readCount == 0     | readCount == N     | assertion!    | readCount == N, return NS_OK -or- |
 * Read ops      | return WOULD_BLOCK | return NS_OK       |               | readCount == 0, return EOF        |
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
