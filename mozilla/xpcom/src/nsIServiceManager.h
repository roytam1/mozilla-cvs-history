/**
 * The nsIServiceManager manager interface provides a means to obtain
 * global services in an application. The service manager depends on the 
 * repository to find and instantiate factories to obtain services.
 *
 * Users of the service manager must first obtain a pointer to the global
 * service manager by calling NS_GetGlobalServiceManager. After that, 
 * they can request specific services by calling GetService. When they are
 * finished with a service the release it by calling ReleaseService (instead
 * of releasing the service object directly):
 *
 *    nsICacheManager* cm;
 *    nsServiceManager::GetService(kCacheManagerCID, kICacheManagerIID, (nsISupports**)&cm);
 *
 *    ... use cm, and then sometime later ...
 *
 *    nsServiceManager::ReleaseService(kCacheManagerCID, cm);
 *
 * A user of a service may keep references to particular services indefinitely
 * and only must call ReleaseService when it shuts down. However if the user
 * wishes to voluntarily cooperate with the shutdown of the service it is 
 * using, it may supply an nsIShutdownListener to provide for asynchronous
 * release of the services it is using. The shutdown listener's OnShutdown
 * method will be called for a service that is being shut down, and it is
 * its responsiblity to release references obtained from that service if at
 * all possible.
 *
 * The process of shutting down a particular service is initiated by calling
 * the service manager's ShutdownService method. This will iterate through
 * all the registered shutdown listeners for the service being shut down, and
 * then will attempt to unload the library associated with the service if
 * possible. The status result of ShutdownService indicates whether the 
 * service was successfully shut down, failed, or was not in service.
 *
 * XXX QUESTIONS:
 * - Should a "service" be more than nsISupports? Should it be a factory 
 *   and/or have Startup(), Shutdown(), etc.
 * - If the asynchronous OnShutdown operation gets called, does the user
 *   of a service still need to call ReleaseService? (Or should they _not_
 *   call it?)
