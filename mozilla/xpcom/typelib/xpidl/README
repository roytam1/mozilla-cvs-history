xpidl depends on Andrew Veliath and Elliot Lee's libIDL, a part of the
GNOME ORBit C ORB. There are RPMs at http://www.hungry.com/~shaver/libIDL/
for ORBit, but you'll need glib of recent vintage (1.1.4 or greater), and
that'll require you to update gtk+ as well.  New glib and gtk+ RPMs can
be found at http://www.gnome.org/~msw/RPMS/i386/.

If you're on Win32, grab libIDL-0.5 .dll and .lib from
http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/libIDL/libIDL-0.5.4-win32.zip and get glib 1.1
and glib 1.1-dev from http://user.sgic.fi/~tml/gimp/win32/, and then you
should be able to build!  There are no Makefiles for Windows yet, but I'll
try and sucker someone into writing them for me RSN.
