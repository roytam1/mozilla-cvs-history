The main goal of module is to give services for calling xpcom objects across
process boundaries.

Currently we are providing one to one relation 
        1
server <== client

The reason of this is that this project was started to help blackwood
projects to use oji on solaris.
(Under solaris jvm is running in a separate process.)
In this specific case we need to have only one to one relation 
(We have one jvm per mozilla running)
------------------------
sources are organized as follows:

server/ - server related
client/ - client related
common/ - related to bough
tests/  - tests for this

-----------------------------------
This code was tested under solaris only
