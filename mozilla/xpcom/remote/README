The main goal of module is to give services for calling xpcom objects across
process boundaries.

Currently we are providing communication between two processes only
        1
The reason of this is that this project was started to help blackwood
projects to use oji on solaris.
(Under solaris jvm is running in a separate process.)
In this specific case we need to have only two process communication
(We have one jvm per mozilla running)
