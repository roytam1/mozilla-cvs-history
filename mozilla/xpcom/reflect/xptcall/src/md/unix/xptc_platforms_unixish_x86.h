/* Platform specific #defines to be shared by the various platforms sharing 
*  the unixish_86 code
*/

/*
*  The goal here is to clearly define the binary compatibility parameters for
*  the platforms that will use this code. Rather than switch at compile time
*  based on the compiler that happens to be in use we are forcing implementors
*  to make a conscious decision.
*
*  For some of these platforms the community may choose to have more than one
*  binary model in effect. In that case I suggest that there be explicit sub
*  defines for that platform specifying 'TYPE1', 'TYPE2', etc. The decision on
*  which 'TYPE' to use would be triggered by a setting passed through from the 
*  config system.
*
*  For example we might end up with something like:
*
* #elif defined(NTO) 
* #  if defined(TYPE1)
* #    define CFRONT_STYLE_THIS_ADJUST
* #  elif defined(TYPE1) 
* #    define THUNK_BASED_THIS_ADJUST
* #  else
* #    error "need TYPE1 or TYPE2 for NTO"
* #  endif
* #elif defined(__BEOS__) 
*
*  and so on....
*
