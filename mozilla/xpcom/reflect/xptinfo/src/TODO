- DOCS
- improve error handling
  - should some errors really be warnings?
  - should autoreg support additional channel to recieve warnings so that
    an installer can decide whether or not to accept the consequences of 
    leaving the newly installed files in place?
- verification of interfaces (warnings and/or errors)
  - verify that repeated interfaces are identical in all ways
  - verify that interface names are always one-to-one with iids    
- check for truncated xpt files and version problems
  - http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33193
- support xpt files in more than just the components dir; e.g. plugins?
   - probably just another field in the manifest containing a number
     i.e. '0' means components dir, '1' means plugins dir, etc.
- TESTS!
   - e.g. verify the merge stuff really works for various inputs.
   - we really need a set of .xpt and .zip files and code that does an array 
     of autoreg and interfaceinof use activitities to test various corners
     of the system.
- support #ifdef'ing out the zip #includes and uses
   - this is needed if we want to remove the #include dependency on libjar
   - most zip code is already in separate file. Only the places where it
     finds and reads zips need #ifdefing - minimize the changes. 
- switch to MoveTo for .dat file 
   - depends on bug 33098 (stupidly marked [feature]!)
- better autoreg logging
- use only 32 bits for file size?
