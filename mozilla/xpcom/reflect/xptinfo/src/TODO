- improve error handling
- verification
- check for truncated xpt files and version problems
- integreate autoreg call with xpcom's component autoreg scheme
- support xpt files in more than just the components dir; e.g. plugins?
   - probably just another field in the manifest containing a number
     i.e. '0' means components dir, '1' means plugins dir, etc.
- TESTS!

- switch to MoveTo for .dat file
- use only 32 bits for file size?
- verify the merge stuff really works
- better autoreg logging
- support #ifdef'ing out the zip #includes and uses
