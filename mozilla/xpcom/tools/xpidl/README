xpidl depends on Andrew Veliath and Elliot Lee's libIDL, a part of the
GNOME ORBit C ORB.  We currently require libIDL >= 0.5.7, which in turn
requires glib >= 1.1.5.

libIDL builds for Linux and Win32 can be found, along with source tarballs,
at http://www.rpi.edu/~veliaa/libIDL/, and Win32 users will need glib 1.1 and
glib 1.1-dev from http://user.sgic.fi/~tml/gimp/win32/.  There are currently
no Makefiles for Windows, but people _are_ building on this platform, so
hopefully they'll check their magic in soon.
