<FONT FACE="Arial,Helvetica">Running Mozilla Without Trashing Netscape
Installation</FONT></H2>
This document explains how to run <TT>mozilla.exe</TT> separately from
<TT>netscape.exe</TT> without trashing your regular installation of Netscape
Communicator. This is necessary if, for example, you want to use Communicator's
mail client while you work on Mozilla development.

Before running <TT>mozilla.exe</TT>, create a new user profile either from
a Netscape 4.0x installation using the "User Profile Manager" shortcut
in the Utilities folder (on Windows) or by using&nbsp; the <TT>-new_account</TT>
option on the command line of either <TT>netscape.exe</TT> or <TT>mozilla.exe</TT>.&nbsp;
We suggest calling the profile "<TT>mozilla</TT>."</LI>

<LI>
Always use that new account when running <TT>mozilla.exe</TT>, and never
run <TT>netscape.exe</TT> using that same account profile.</LI>
</OL>
To make things easier, you can start the application with the user account
on the command line, for example:
<UL><TT>mozilla.exe -P"mozilla"</TT></UL>
This assures that prefs and the cache will not interfere between the two
versions. This will be especially
<BR>important as new prefs are added to the Mozilla product. Note that
you must use quotes around the name and there can be no space between the
"P" and the profile name. Otherwise, the application won't catch the profile
switch, and it will try to load the profile name as the initial URL.

<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<BR>You can copy your <TT>bookmark.htm</TT> file from an existing profile
to your new profile directory if you want to share bookmarks.

<P>After the initial 3/31 release, we will add some code to Mozilla to
prevent running with a profile that is already being used by <TT>netscape.exe</TT>.
