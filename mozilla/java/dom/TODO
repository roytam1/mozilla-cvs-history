o Implement DOM exceptions.

o Implement the equals() and hashCode() methods for all DOM
objects. The equals method is to be implemented by doing a
QueryInterface to nsISupports and them comparing pointers to the
native DOM objects.

o Use OJI to obtain the JVM.

o i18n the API

o Implement DOMEvents from the DOM Level 2 current working draft.

o Investigate the possibility of writing a tool that can generate the
JNI code from idl. This is the only practical way to implement the
HTML DOM (because it is too big to hand-code).
