This document describes steps required to run the Test Suite for JavaDOM API.

For Solaris
===========
  1)  open mozilla.csh

  2)  make changes to variables
          MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME           - Absolute path where mozilla-bin 
                                        executable is located.
          JAVA_HOME                   - Absolute Path to JDK dir.
          TEST_PATH                   - Absolute Directory Path where file 
                                        BWTestClass.lst is located.
          USE_APPLET_FOR_REGISTRATION - set this variable if you wish to use 
                                        applet for running tests Otherwise 
                                        hacked DOMAccessor class is used.

  3)  source mozilla.csh 
      this will set up the environment

  4)  Edit BWProperties file and change the locations for variables
          BW_TESTDIR    (Absolute Directory Path where file BWTestClass.lst is 
                         located)
          BW_LOGDIR     (Absolute Directory Path where  log files need to be 
                         created)
          BW_THREADMODE (Execute tests in single thread [S] or 
                         multi-thread [M] mode. Takes values S/M.)
          BW_HTMLTEST   (URL where redirect.html file are located. Used if you 
                         run tests through TestLoader applet)
          BW_XMLTEST    (URL where test.xml file are located. Used if you run 
                         tests through TestLoader applet)

  5)  Copy redirect.html, redirectxml.html, test.html and test.xml files to your Web-Servers DOCUMENT_ROOT
      (By default it is assumed that they can be accessed as
        http://<server name>/redirect.html).
        or
        http://<server name>/~<username>/redirect.html).

  6)  Invoke autorun.sh from command prompt.
       sh autorun.sh

  7)  The results are recorded in HTML file BWTest.html
      and in log file BWTest.log
      Individual test Log files are also found in 'log' directory.

  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Invoke a specific test case 
   sh autorun.sh -t org.mozilla.dom.test.AttrImpl_getName

NOTE: All Test Cases are reocorded in file BWTestClass.lst.ORIG

Assumption:

 I  assume that u have copied the files test.xml  
 and redirect.html, redirectxml.html,  test.html to your DOCUMENT_ROOT of 
 your WebServer.
 The URL it tries to load is  http://<servername>/redirect.html.

 If it is set in users public_html then open file autorun.sh
 and change DOCROOT accordingly.



=============================================================================

For WIN32
===========
Assumes you have installed PERL and the following variables are set in your environment:
  MOZILLA_HOME - top directory in mozilla's tree
  JAVA_HOME    - path to JDK

  1)  open mozilla.bat

  2)  make changes to variables
          USE_APPLET_FOR_REGISTRATION - set this variable if you wish to use 
                                        applet for running tests
                                        (now available under Win32 only). 
                                        Otherwise hacked DOMAccessor class 
                                        is used.
          MOZILLA_BIN                 - Mozilla's executable file name 
                                        (e.g. mozilla.exe or viewer.exe)
          TEST_PATH                   - path to the current directory 
                                        (where mozilla.bat is)
          TEST_URL                    - URL where redirect.html and test.html
                                        are located (complete URL looks like: 
                                        $TEST_URL/redirect.html).Used if you 
                                        run tests through hacked DOMAccessor only

  3)  execute mozilla.bat from command prompt
      this will create new console and set up the environment for this 
      command prompt 

  4)  Edit BWProperties file and change the locations for variables
           BW_TESTDIR    (Absolute Directory Path where file BWTestClass.lst is 
                          located)
           BW_LOGDIR     (Absolute Directory Path where  log files need to be 
                          created)
           BW_THREADMODE (Execute tests in single thread [S] or 
                          multi-thread [M] mode. Takes values S/M.)
  
           BW_HTMLTEST   (URL where redirect.html file is located. Used if you 
                          run tests through TestLoader applet)
           BW_XMLTEST    (URL where test.xml file is located. Used if you 
                          run tests through TestLoader applet)
     
      NOTE: Since on Windows file separator is a `\`, it should be escaped 
            by another '\'. So if a file is in c:\mozilla\tests then it
            would be written as c:\\mozilla\\tests.
      

  5)  Invoke autorun.pl from command prompt.
         perl autorun.pl
      For quick testing say
          if you use applet for registration  
             mozilla.exe file:/TestLoaderHTML.html
              (mozilla.exe file:/TestLoaderXML.html)

          if you use hacked DOMAcceessor.
             mozilla.exe file:/redirect.html

  7)  The results are recorded in HTML file BWTest.html
      and in log file BWTest.log
      Individual test Log files are also found in 'log' directory.

  
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To Invoke a specific test case 
   perl autorun.pl -t org.mozilla.dom.test.AttrImpl_getName

NOTE: All Test Cases are recorded in file BWTestClass.lst.ORIG
