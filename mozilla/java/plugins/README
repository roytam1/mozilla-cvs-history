================================
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/blackwood/java-plugins/
--------------------------------
This directory contains the beginnings of the Java-Implemented plug-uns.

The sources is divided into four directories

	classes
	       Java source files
	src 
	       Native code (c++/c)
	jni
	       Implamentations of java native methods
	test
	       Test code, including simple pluglet.

========================================================================
Win32 Directions:
========================================================================
Requirements:

* current mozilla built tree

* JDK1.3 or JDK1.2 if you are not using OJI

* Perl 5 perl.exe must be in your path

How To Build:

*  make sure the environment var JDKHOME is set to your jdk installation
   directory, ie SET JDKHOME=C:\jdk1.2

* if you do not have working OJI set OJI_DISABLE to 1
  (You can do it in your command prompt, or you can set it in 
   mozilla/java/plugins/src/makefile.win).

* type "nmake /f makefile.win"

How to Run:

* Add following directories to to your path:
  %MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME%
  In case OJI_DISABLE add %JDKHOME%\jre\bin\client to your path

* Copy class files from mozilla/dist/classes to your JRE/lib/ext directory and
add JRE/lib/ext to your classpath
 
How to build and run test
* go to the test directory and type "nmake /f makefile.win"

* Set PLUGLET environment to the  directory you have test.jar

* Run mozilla and load page test.html from test directory and if everething is ok you will see
  some awt demo.

* Add following directories to to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH:

$MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME:$JDKHOME/jre/lib/$HOSTTYPE/native_threads:$JDKHOME/jre/lib/$HOSTTYPE/client:
$JDKHOME/jre/lib/$HOSTTYPE/:

* type "gmake"
     
How to Run:
	 
* Add $MOZILLA_FILE_HOME/../classes to your CLASSPATH

How to build and run test

* go to the test directory and type "gmake"
  test.jar will be placed  in mozilla/dist/bin/plugins directory

* set LD_PRELOAD to libXm.so (to libawt.so on linux platform)

TD> Hello Ed,
TD> Sorry to say but there remained something wrong.

TD> The installation and the building of the project was easy.
TD> Firefox is started nicely when running the project,
TD> and the ...examples/index.html was displayed.

TD> But none of the two examples seem to work, only blank pages are sho=
wn.
TD> (The HTML sources do contain the code we expect i.e. the navigation=
 from the
TD> index.html to the examples works of course.)

TD> A looked to about:plugins, nppluglet is enabled.
TD> I checked prefs.js it contains the following lines (among other one=
s):
TD> user_pref("plugin.allow_alien_star_handler", true);
TD> user_pref("plugin.default_plugin_disabled", false);
TD> user_pref("plugin.override_internal_types", true);

TD> I do not know what the problem is.

Can you please remove your "Documents and Settings/<USERID>/Application=

Data/Mozilla" directory, start the browser, stop the browser, re-edit
the prefs.js, and try again?

Ed

also remove pluginreg.dat

in C:\Projects\chaff\pluglet-1-1-a1\

find netbeans -name private -prune -o -type f -exec cp {} "/cygdrive/c/Projects/mozilla/MOZILLA_NIH/FIREFOX_2_0_0_3_RELEASE/mozilla/java/plugins/dist/{}" ;
