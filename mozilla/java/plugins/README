Win32 Build Directions:
========================================================================
Requirements:

* built M8 mozilla tree for WinNT4.0

* JDK1.3

* Perl 5 perl.exe must be in your path

How To Build:

* Follow the directions in ..\README

* if you do not have working OJI set OJI_DISABLE to 1
  (You can do it in your command prompt, or you can set it in 
   mozilla/java/plugins/src).

* type "nmake /f makefile.win"

How to Run:

* Add following directories to to your path:
  %MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME%
  In case OJI_DISABLED add %JDKHOME%\jre\bin\classic to your path

* Copy class files from mozilla/dist/classes to your JRE/lib/ext directory and
add JRE/lib/ext to your classpath
 
How to build and run test
* go to the test directory and type "nmake /f makefile.win"

* Set PLUGLET environment to the  directory you have test.jar

* Run mozilla and load page test.html from test directory and if evething is ok you will see
  some output from the test pluglet on the stdout.

Problems:

* clobber_all doesn't remove the .class files from dist\classes.  You
  have to do this manually.

* post to netscape.public.mozilla.java newsgroup
