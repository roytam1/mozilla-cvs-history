Here lies the java classes that comprise the org.mozilla.util pagkage,
sometimes called MJUTIL for Mozilla Java Utils.  This is not a complete
program, just a library.

Authors: Rob Davis, Paul Kim, Alan Chung, Ray Ryan, Ed Burns, Keith Bernstein,          David-John Burrowes

Requirements:

* JDK1.1.7 or greater (may work with lower versions, haven't checked).

* M8 or post M8 mozilla tree

* Perl 5 perl.exe must be in your path

How To Build:

* make it so the directory in which this file resides is a child of your
  top level mozilla\java directory

* Copy the files ..\webclient\config\buildpkg.bat and
  ..\webclient\config\outofdate.pl to mozilla\config.  These file were
  modified after M8 and the modifications are required to build java.

* make sure the environment var JDKHOME is set to your jdk installation
  directory, ie SET JDKHOME=C:\jdk1.1.8

* type "nmake /f makefile.win all" and hope for the best

* this should compile the clasess into %MOZ_SRC%\dist\classes

Problems:

* clobber_all doesn't remove the .class files from dist\classes.  You
  have to do this manually.

* post to netscape.public.mozilla.java newsgroup

General notes:

* Please update the ChangeLog (changelo) when you make changes.
