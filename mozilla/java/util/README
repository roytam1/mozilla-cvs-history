Here lies the java classes that comprise the org.mozilla.util pagkage,
sometimes called MJUTIL for Mozilla Java Utils.  This is not a complete
program, just a library.

Authors: Rob Davis, Paul Kim, Alan Chung, Ray Ryan, Ed Burns, Keith Bernstein,          David-John Burrowes

Requirements:

* JDK1.1.7 or greater (may work with lower versions, haven't checked).

* M8 or post M8 mozilla tree

* Perl 5 perl.exe must be in your path

How To Build:

* Follow the directions in ..\README

* type "nmake /f makefile.win all" and hope for the best

* this should compile the clasess into %MOZ_SRC%\dist\classes

Problems:

* clobber_all doesn't remove the .class files from dist\classes.  You
  have to do this manually.
