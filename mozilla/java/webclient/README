Here lies the MozWebShell java wrapper to mozilla M8.

Authors: Kirk Baker <kbaker@eb.com>
         Ian Wilkinson <iw@ennoble.co>

Build hacking and packaging: Ed Burns <edburns@acm.org>

Requirements:

* built M8 mozilla tree for WinNT4.0

* JDK1.1.7 or greater

* built org.mozilla.util java classes (see NOTE_UTIL)

* Perl 5 perl.exe must be in your path

How To Build:

* make it so the directory in which this file resides is a child of your
  top level mozilla\java directory

* Copy the files .\config\buildpkg.bat and .\config\outofdate.pl to
  mozilla\config.  These file were modified after M8 and the
  modifications are required to build java.

* make sure the environment var JDKHOME is set to your jdk installation
  directory, ie SET JDKHOME=C:\jdk1.1.8

* type "nmake /f makefile.win all" and hope for the best

* Due to bug 10561 (http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10561)
  one must do a horrendous workaround:

  In the directory mozilla/dist/WIN32_D.OBJ/bin, copy the components.reg
  file and the components directory to the following places:

  C:\WINNT\System32
  %JDKHOME%\jre\bin

How to Run:

* once the build has successfully completed, run this batch file:

  .\src\WIN32_D.OBJ\runem.bat <opt: YOUR_URL>

  Note that YOUR_URL is probably necessary since firewall support wasn't
  working in M8.


Problems:

* clobber_all doesn't remove the .class files from dist\classes.  You
  have to do this manually.

* post to netscape.public.mozilla.java newsgroup

General notes:

* Please update the ChangeLog (changelo) when you make changes.

NOTE_UTIL:

* this package depends on the org.mozilla.util classes, which can be
  found in the mozilla tree under mozilla\java\util.  They are a
  separate checkout and build.  Once you check out the org.mozilla.util
  classes, see the README in the mozilla\java\util\README.
