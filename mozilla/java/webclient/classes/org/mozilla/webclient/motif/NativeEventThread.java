/**
 * This is NativeEventThread. It's job is to process any pending mozilla events
 * which have been queued up.
 * 
 * It also contains a private static hashtable mapping of GTK window to 
 * WebShellInitContexts (see BrowserControllMozillaShim.cpp). It needs this
 * because in order to process any GTK / Mozilla events, it needs a pointer
 * to the native event queue, the native web shell, as well as native pointers
 * to other things which it can't readily access.
 * So what we do is when the WebShellInitContext for a GTK Window first gets 
 * created, it gets stored in the webShellContextMapping hashtable below. Then 
 * we can now easily lookup the appropriate WebShellInitContext when it is needed.
 * 
 * <B>Lifetime And Scope</B> <P>
 * There will be one of these per BrowserControlCanvas (but hasn't been tested yet)
 *
 * @version $Id$
