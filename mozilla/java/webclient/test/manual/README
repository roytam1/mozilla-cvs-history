		Webclient manual testbase.

1. How to build.

  Before building of manual testbase you need to edit
  CommonProperties config file (<TOP-MANUAL>/config/CommonProperties).
  Please change HTML_ROOT, HTML_ROOT_DIR, CGI_BIN_ROOT, CGI_BIN_ROOT_DIR
  properties to your values. This config file is self documented
  and contain example values.

  After that please cd to the TOP_MANUAL/build directory and do make

2. Requirements.

  To use manual testbase you need a HTTP server. Please
  configure and run this server before building. Testbase
  was verified on Apache/1.3.1 (Unix) and JavaWebServer2.0 
  (sparc, Solaris 2.6).
 
  Also you need to build Mozilla and webclient.  

3. How to use.
   
   After performing step 1 and 2
    run webclient (i.e cd to <TOP_MOZILLA>/mozilla/java/webclient/src_moz
                   <prompt %> runem http://sunweb.central or whatever )
   and perform the following steps:
    - load $(HTML_ROOT)/manual/index.html.
    - select the subset of tests to execute
    - execute tests and see the log of execution
