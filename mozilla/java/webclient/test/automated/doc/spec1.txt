Webclient automated API tests draft description (20/04/2000)

API testing should consist from 2 main Parts:
Interfaces, quered by test application ,
that are part of test application and registered in webclient API

Quered interfaces:
	webclient.BrowserControlCanvas
	webclient.CurrentPage 
	webclient.EventRegistration 
	webclient.ExtendedEventRegistration <SKIP> Not implemethed
	webclient.History 
	webclient.Navigation 
	webclient.cache.NetDataCacheManager <SKIP> Not implemethed
	webclient.Preferences               <SKIP> Not implemethed
	webclient.Print                     <SKIP> Not implemethed
	webclient.WindowControl   

Suggestions about white box testing:
1)API tests for all interfaces, quered from BrowserControl:
 - Verify that API doesn't crashed on critical values for each parameter
 - Verify, that correct values returned(when possible)
 - Verify correct work on different life stages
    (For example try to history.getURLForIndex(i),
     when no URLs loaded.)

2)Test on events
 - Tests on right sequence of events
   (For example when load new URL next events should occurs:
    START_DOCUMENT_LOAD,..,END_DOCUMENT_LOAD)
 - Tests on right event generation.
    (For example when we make STOP during url loading,
     corresponding event should occurs)
