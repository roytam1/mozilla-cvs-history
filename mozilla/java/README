Here lies the code that comprises the java enhancers to mozilla.

Authors: see the README files for each individual subdirectory

Requirements:

* JDK1.2 or greater (may work with lower versions, haven't checked).

* Successfully built MOZ_DEBUG=1 Mozilla M13 tree.

* Perl 5 perl.exe must be in your path

How To Build:

* make it so the directory in which this file resides is a child of your
  top level Mozilla M13 directory

* make sure the environment var JDKHOME is set to your jdk installation
  directory, ie SET JDKHOME=C:\jdk1.2.2

* type "nmake /f makefile.win all" and hope for the best

* this should compile the clasess into %MOZ_SRC%\dist\classes

Problems:

* clobber_all doesn't remove the .class files from dist\classes.  You
  have to do this manually.

* post to netscape.public.mozilla.java newsgroup

General notes:

* Please update the ChangeLog (changelo) files in the subdirectories when
  you make changes.
