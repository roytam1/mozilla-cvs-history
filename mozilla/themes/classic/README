unix builds the windows classic skin, all of the unix sub directories are ignored, and exists as 
placeholders for a future implementation.

this is the classic skin (the original 6.0 skin)

if you add to this, make sure you add to the other skin, otherwise when you
switch skins, bad things will happen.
