/**
 * This interface encapsulates an arbitrary block to be used
 * by the soap serialization or protocol.  It presents the
 * namespaceURI, name, encoding, schemaType, and value of the
 * block.  There are two different ways this may be used:
 * <p>1.  When created by a user for serialization, a value is set
 * which is then used to encode the message.  In this case, the
 * user sets the value (or element in the case of a literal
 * block) which is then encoded (unless it is the element) 
 * and incorporated into the document as it is encoded.
 * <p>2.  When requested by the user from a message that is to
 * be decoded.  In this case, an element is set on the block
 * which is automatically decoded whenever the value attribute is
 * accessed (possibly after the user sets the encoding or schemaType,
 * or for literal blocks, the user just accesses the element and
 * no decoding is performed.  For SOAP which attachments, hidden 
 * attachments may also be associated from the message to the block 
 * so that later decoding which relies on the attachments is possible.
