/* Make sure that we don't accidently overwrite files with newer
   or different changes. It will open a conflictResolve.xul dialog,
   if necessary. */

  /* First, we transfer the "listing" file from the server. This contains
     stats about the files on the server,
     like filenames, their last modification date and their filesizes.
     It is true that the same information could be obtained via the HTTP
     protocol (e.g. HTTP HEAD), but that would
     - be a lot harder to skip retrieval of already downloaded files,
       if we make only one connection per file,
       because we'd have to use modification time sent in the header right
       before the data and stop the transfer at the right time
     - be protocol-specific in the Mozilla implementation, unless we
       fix bug 186016 for all protocols we want to support
     - depend on the user's realtime clock to be correct
     The file format is XML, see example.

     A conflict is to have 2 versions of the same file, none a direct
     successor of the other (or the possibility thereof).

     Possible problems/conflicts:
     - Download
       - listing file transfer from server fails
       - listing from server is older than listing-uploaded
         (I don't think this can actually happen in practice, unless the
         clock is screwed)
       - listing-uploaded doesn't match profile files
         (incl. last download failed fatally)
       - download of individual files fails
     - Upload
       - listing file transfer from server fails
       - listing file from server is newer than listing-downloaded
         (other instance updated server while we were running or
         the last download failed)
       - listing file from server is newer than listing-uploaded
         Already covered by previous case / during download
       - listing from server is older than listing-downloaded
         (I don't think this can actually happen in practice, unless the
         clock is screwed)
       - upload of some files fails
       - upload fails fatally (crash etc.)
       - Mozilla crashed/term. before it had a chance to even start the upload

     Checks/Steps:
     - Download
       1. Transfer listing file from server to listing.xml
       2. Compare compare listing uploaded with listing.xml from server.
          - if they match, then we already have the newest version locally and
            don't need to download and don't have a problem/conflict either,
            even if the local files don't match listing.xml from server.
            We can just copy the listing.xml from server to
            listing-downloaded and be done.
          - if they don't match, then either
            - another instanceuploaded after
              we ran the last time, which is not a problem in itself, but we
              need to download and make more checks for conflicts.
            - our last upload finished only partially, which we will consider
              a problem and a conflict XXX
            2a. Compare local files with listing-uploaded
                - if they don't match, we have a conflict (unless the listing
                  from the server matches listing-uploaded, but then we already
                  decided above that we don't have a problem)
       3. If there were conflicts, ask the user what to do
       4. Download files
       5. If transfer succeeded, move listing.xml to listing-downloaded.
          Note that we do that independent of the choices in conflict
          resolution. If the user made his choice, we assume that we doesn't
          care about the other files, so here we just pretend that we used
          them, so that conflict resolution in later runs doesn't come up
          for the same conflict anymore.
       5. Unused: (not sure, if needed or even a good idea)
          Check local files against listing.xml.
          - if they match (esp. filesizes), all went fine. Move listing.xml
            to listing-downloaded.
          - if they don't match, we have a severe problem. We just overwrote
            the local files (which are assumed to be good) with broken
            versions. Warn the user. Remove listing-downloaded, which
            will cause conflicts during the next upload, which allows the
            user to then prevent overwriting of the file on the server, which
            might still be OK. This won't help, if the upload failed although
            netwerk reported success, but I don't know how to protect against
            that apart from a temporary second copy of the files.
     - Upload
       1. Transfer listing file from server to listing.xml
       2. Compare listing-downloaded with listing.xml from server
          - if they match, our local version is the newest, so there is no
            conflict here.
          - if they don't match, then either
            - another instance uploaded while we ran. classic conflict.
              listing.xml won't match listing-uploaded in this case, so we
              can use the checks for the next case.
            - the last download failed.
            2a. Compare listing.xml from the server with listing-uploaded
                - If they match, then we don't have a problem here,
                  because we were the last ones who uploaded
                  and we probably have the same info still in the local files.
                - if the don't match, then another instance uploaded after
                  we last uploaded, and we didn't get that info yet, so we have
                  a conflict.
       3. If there were conflicts, ask the user what to do        
       4. Upload profile files
       5  Create listing file for server based on conflict choices and
          upload success
       6. Upload listing file (created in step 6)
       7. Create listing-uploaded, not containing those files for which
          the user selected the server version (otherwise, we would think
          in the next download run that we have them already in the local
          profile, not download them and then overwrite the server file
          during the next upload)
