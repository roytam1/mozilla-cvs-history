- conflict
  - listing transfer
    - HTTP: downloaded listing.xml cannot be read (gives HTML doc)
    - FTP: downloaded file is empty
    - save login from listing transfer for main transfer v
    - progress feedback and error reporting
  - reading of listing file works only half v?
  - some files failed (see XXX)
  - pressing x activates OK, not cancel
  - pressing cancel uploads/downloads
  - fix dialog
  - resize for listing.xml
- Bugs
  - trunk: upload
    - ftp: offline
    - http: not initialized
  - overwriting local files, if login is incorrect?
- error handling
  - files deleted on server / server changed. listing-uploaded no longer true
  - (local profile) files missing
  - pressing cancel after finished with failed, all files are set to abort
  - copy protocol
    - no remote files yet
- world gone
  - problem: ddump, xpcom not defined after files done and dialog closed
    solution: close dialog only when done with processing.
    workaround: gTimeout
  - problem: cancel by user in progress dialog: xpconnect errors
    solution: prevent dialog closure (even if cancel pressed) until we're done.

Later:
- nsiprogresseventsink comment
- license headers
- nsresult for internal functions, clean up interfaces
- warn before saving pw
- remove printfs
- rewrite dialog
- XXXs

Enhance
- protocols
  - HTTPSvague
  - LDAP

- no upload at switch profile
