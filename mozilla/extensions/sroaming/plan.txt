- conflict
  - listing transfer
    - progress feedback and error reporting
  - some files failed (see XXX - update: eh, where was that?)
  - fix dialog
    - column headings
    - width
- Bugs
  - some files never "finish" (compare feedback below)
    - ftp upload: ok -> busy [4]
- error handling
  - (local profile) files missing, also adjust listing.xml
  - pressing cancel after finished with failed, all files are set to abort v
  - copy protocol
    - no remote files yet
- world gone
  - problem: ddump, xpcom not defined after files done and dialog closed
    solution: close dialog only when done with processing.
    workaround: gTimeout
  - problem: cancel by user in progress dialog: xpconnect errors
    solution: prevent dialog closure (even if cancel pressed) until we're done.

Later:
- nsiprogresseventsink comment
- license headers
- nsresult for internal functions, clean up interfaces
- warn before saving pw
- alert() -> nsiprompt
- remove printfs
- XXXs

Enhance
- protocols
  - HTTPS
  - LDAP (already done by Sun? :-) )
  - IMAP
- password encrypt
- rewrite progress dialog
- no upload at switch profile
- don't transfer files that didn't change (server = local)

roaming urls
 <ftp://user@ftp-server//path/to/dir/>
 <http://user@http-server/path/to/dir/>
 Mind the number of slashes.
 Servers used: wu-FTPd and Apache with mod_roaming.


Feedback
- why do I need to implement nsIDocShellTreeItem for a http xml file *download*?
- onStopRequest (Request: http://ben:pgpben@http.server.bucksch.org/roaming/ben/listing.xml, StatusCode: NS_OK, HTTPResponse 200) called *before*  the file finished.
