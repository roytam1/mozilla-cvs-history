geckoterm --- Stand-alone version of XMLterm using Gecko

This directory contains the files used to create the stand-alone XMLterm
executable, which runs independent of the browser. This would be the preferred
way to use XMLterm, so that it runs as a separate process and will not
crash if the browser does.
