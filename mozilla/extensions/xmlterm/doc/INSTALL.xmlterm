XMLterm installation instructions for Linux binaries
----------------------------------------------------

*NOTE* This work in progress. User beware!

*NOTE* This plain text INSTALL file may be out date. Please check
       <http://xmlterm.org/install.html> for the most recent information.

1. First obtain the Mozilla Linux binary tar file
   ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/releases/m14/mozilla-i686-pc-linux-gnu-M14.tar.gz"
   and untar it in any convenient location. This will create a
   directory named "package" containing the binaries.

2. Untar the XMLterm binary tar file "xmlterm-i686-pc-linux-gnu-M14.tar.gz"
   in the "package" directory created above.

3. Type the following command in the "package" directory:

     ./mozilla -chrome chrome://xmlterm/content/xmlterm.xul

   This should create an XMLTerm in the browser window. Then click on
   that window with the mouse to shift focus and start typing UNIX
   commands.

   **NOTE**
   The command prompt is assumed to be terminated by one of the characters
   "#$%>?", followed by a space. If this is not the case, many features will
   not work. This restriction will be relaxed in the future.

4. To use the stand-alone XMLterm executable called "xmlterm",
   type the following command in the "package" directory:

   ./xmlterm

   "xmlterm" is shorthand for the following command, which you may also execute
   directly

   ./mozilla -chrome chrome://xmlterm/content/xmlterm.xul

   The above command(s) should create an XMLterm window. Click on that window
   with the mouse to give it focus and start typing UNIX commands.

   **NOTE**
   The command prompt is assumed to be terminated by one of the characters
   "#$%>?", followed by a space. If this is not the case, many features will
   not work. This restriction will be relaxed in the future.

5. The command line can be edited using EMACS-style key bindings.
   Command completion should also work with TCSH and BASH, as should history
   recall.

6. By default, blue coloring is used to indicate clickable display elements.
   Note that the prompt and the input command line are clickable.
   (Of course, the appearance of XMLterm is completely configurable
   using the CSS stylesheet chrome://xmlterm/skin/default/xmlterm.css)

   After typing one or two commands, click on the prompt string of any previous
   command to see what happens! Then click again on the same prompt string.
   Also click on "Hide all output" button at the top of the document.

   Clicking on a previous command line (to the right of the prompt) re-executes
   the command.

7. The sample Perl script "xls", the iconic/hypertext version of the Unix "ls"
   command, is in the "package" directory. Also in the "package" directory
   is "xcat", an XMLterm-aware version of the "cat" command.

8. To use XMLterm most efficiently, add the mozilla "package" directory
   to your execution PATH variable by modifying your shell initialization file
   (.profile/.cshrc). This will enable you to use commands such as
   "xmlterm", "xls", and "xcat" easily.
