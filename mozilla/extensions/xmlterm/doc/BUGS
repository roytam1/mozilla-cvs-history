1. XMLterm bug: Early use of "xls -i" does not scroll properly

2. DOM/IFRAME bug: window.document object not defined for dynamically
   created IFRAME elements using DOM

3. XMLterm bug: Typing text in text input element causes input to be duplicated
   in the command line

4. LTERM/NCURSES bug: Executing "emacs -nw" in the NCURSES version of LTERM
   results in LTERM exiting abnormally when user exits emacs. An interrupt
   error seems to occur while polling for output in ltermRead.

5. When cursor is at leftmost position on the line, clickin on the window
   moves it up (very annoying)

6. vi command does not scroll properly prior to first input (somewhat annoying)
