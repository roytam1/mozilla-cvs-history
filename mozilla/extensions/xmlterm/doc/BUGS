Known bugs
----------

29 Feb 2000

1. Mozilla bug (Solaris only): The cursor has disappeared! (also in Composer)

2. DOM/IFRAME bug: window.document object not defined for dynamically
   created IFRAME elements using DOM. Currently prevent the use of IFRAMEs
   for inline display of HTML documents

3. XMLterm bug: Typing text in text input element causes input to be duplicated
   in the command line. Controlled by Javascript WORKAROUND in xmlterm.html
   to detect onFocus and onBlur events and suspend key event handling by
   mozXMLTermKeyListener

4. DOM/Layout bug: When cursor is at leftmost position on the line, clicking
   on the window moves it up (very annoying). Mitigated by a WORKAROUND in
   mozXMLTermMouseListener::MouseClick.

5. XMLterm bug: Arrow keys are bound to EMACS-style control characters;
   do not work with VI

6. LTERM/NCURSES bug: Executing "emacs -nw" in the NCURSES version of LTERM
   results in LTERM exiting abnormally when user exits emacs. An interrupt
   error seems to occur while polling for output in ltermRead.
