1. Early use of "xls -i" does not scroll properly

2. DOM/IFRAME bug: window.document object not defined for dynamically
   created IFRAME elements using DOM

3. Typing text in text input element causes input to be duplicated
   in the command line

4. Executing "emacs -nw" in the NCURSES version of LTERM results in
   LTERM exiting abnormally when user exits emacs. An interrupt error
   seems to occur while polling for output in ltermRead.
