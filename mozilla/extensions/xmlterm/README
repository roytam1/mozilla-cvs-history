xmlterm --- A graphical command line interface
==============================================

An early prototype of XMLterm, an XTERM-like terminal program implemented
using the open source Mozilla layout engine, is now available to tinker
with. XMLterm aims to add graphical and hypertext capabilities to the XTERM
command line interface, while maintaining backwards compatibility.

The basic design philosophy of XMLterm is that the user interface is a dynamic
XML document. The user and the computer interact by taking turns at appending
to this XML document. The plain text content of the XML document, i.e.,
excluding any markup, corresponds to the plain text that would be displayed by
a plain XTERM. The markup in the XML document is used to add graphical and
hypertext features. XMLterm uses the Mozilla layout engine to display the XML
document.

XMLterm is an open source project in its early stages. Comments and
contributions are welcome!
