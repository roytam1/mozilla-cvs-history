The buster is a XUL interface to the conformance tests shipped as part of
Xalan. For information about Xalan, please see http://xml.apache.org/.
For your convenience we provide a packed distribution of all needed files
in http://www.axel.pike.org/mozilla/xalan.tar.gz. Please see the included 
LICENSE.txt or http://xml.apache.org/dist/LICENSE.txt for terms of 
distributing those files.

To use the buster, open buster.xul with a XSLT enabled Mozilla. Warning,
it takes quite a while until that page is fully loaded, and due to bug
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=70324, we don't have scrolling.
You can use regular expressions to narrow the set of tests to run.
Once you have selected the tests you're interested in, press the button
"run checked tests", and all the tests will be run.

DiffDOM tries to find out, which tests failed, and will DumpDOM both the
result and the reference solution. Not all reference solutions load
properly, those need manual love.

All of the code was done sleeping, and is not intended as example of good 
code. It's for debugging only!

Good luck and fun
