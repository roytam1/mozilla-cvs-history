The current "target" XSLT version is the 19991116 XSLT Recommendation, which
can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116.
XPath implementation is also "targeting" the 19991116 version.

What's Remaining?

-- Network support for URI handling  (standalone version only)

  -- currently I only implemented the file:/// protocol
  -- Note: Peter Van der Beken is currently working on integrating the
     URIUtils for use when compiled as a Mozilla module

-- I18N support for sorting and numbering

-- Finishing sorting for xsl:for-each and xsl:apply-templates
   -- simple sorting is working, see examples/sort.xml[xsl]

-- Stylesheet inclusion using xsl:import
   -- xsl:include works

-- XSLT Additional functions  (Section 12 in the XSLT 1.0 Rec)

   See examples/functions.html for a list of available functions

   -- document() has been implemented by Olivier Gerardin
      - The second argument is currently not supported.

   -- Remaining functions which need to be implemented:
      - From section 12.2, the key() function
      - From section 12.3, the format-number() function
      - From section 12.4
          - system-property()
          - unparsed-entity-uri()

-- Add support for xsl:key (XSLT 1.0, Section 12.2)

-- Fallback (XSLT 1.0, Section 15)

-- convert result-ns, and indent-result to new xsl:output
   -- some of this has been done

-- Add support for disable-output-escaping (Section 16.4) for xsl:text

-- clean up Namespace handling
