The current "target" XSLT version is the 19991116 XSLT Recommendation, which
can be found at http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116. 
XPath implementation is also "targeting" the 19991116 version.

What's Remaining?

-- Network support for URI handling
  -- currently I only implemented the file:/// protocol

-- I18N support for sorting and numbering

-- Sorting for xsl:for-each and xsl:apply-templates

-- Stylesheet inclusion using xsl:import
   -- xsl:include works

-- finish XPath function implementations
   -- see examples/functions.html for a list of available functions

-- XSLT additional functions
   -- document(), etc.

-- Add support for xsl:key

-- convert result-ns, and indent-result to new xsl:output
   -- some of this has been done

-- clean up Namespace handling
