The current target working draft is the 19990813 XSLT Working Draft, which
can be found at http://www.w3.org/1999/08/WD-xslt-19990813. XPath 
implementation is also 19990813 version.

What's Remaining?

-- I18N support for sorting and numbering
-- Sorting for xsl:for-each and xsl:apply-templates
-- Stylesheet inclusion using xsl:import (xsl:include now works)
-- finish XPath function implementations
-- XSLT additional functions
-- convert result-ns, and indent-result to new xsl:output
-- Extensions
-- clean up Namespace handling
