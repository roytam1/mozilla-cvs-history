<h2>Using the Mail Account Setup Wizard</h2>
<a name="NEWSGROUP"></a>

<p>The very first time you launch Mail, if you have not already set up an account, Mail displays the Account Wizard so you can create an account. Later, you can <a href="#additional_accounts">add additional mail and newsgroup accounts</a> from the File menu of the Mail window by choosing New, then Account. (Or, you can also open the Edit menu of the Mail window, choose Mail/News Account Settings, and then click the New Account button.)

<p>The Wizard asks you to provide required information, such as your user name and email address. If you do not know a setting, you can exit the Wizard and consult your Internet service provider (ISP) or help desk.
<p>To set up a mail account with an ISP or email provider, you'll need to provide:
<ul>
<li>your user name</li>
<li>your email address</li>
<li>the incoming and outgoing mail server names</li>
<li>the incoming server type (<a href="#IMAP_and_POP3">IMAP or POP3</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>To set up a newsgroup account, you'll need to provide:
<ul>
<li>your name
	<li>your email address</li>
	<li>newsgroup server name</li>
	<li>account name
</ul>
<p>To set up an AOL or Netscape WebMail account, you only need to provide your email address and the name you would like to use for the account (your user name).

<p>To set up a new mail or newsgroup account:
<p>Begin from the Netscape browser window.
<ol>
<li>Open the Task menu and then choose Mail. You see the Mail window.</li>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail/News Account Settings.</li>
<li>Click the New Account button to activate the New Account wizard.</li>
<li>Choose the type of account you want to set up, and click Next. The information the wizard asks you to provide depends on the type of account you are setting up. The rest of the steps in this section assume you are setting up an account with an ISP or email provider.</li>
<li>
In the Identity section, enter your name (as you would like it to appear in the "From"
field of messages you send) and email address, and click Next.</li>

<li>
In the Server Information section, select the type of incoming mail server (<a href="#IMAP_and_POP3">IMAP or POP3</a>). Enter the incoming server name and the outgoing (SMTP) server name (this is the name of the mail server that sends your messages, and is also known as your
SMTP host). Then click Next.</li>
<p><b>Note</b>: Only one outgoing mail server (SMTP) needs to be specified, even if you have several mail accounts.
The name of your SMTP host may not have been reported
to you in your ISP information or by your system administrator. Your SMTP
host may be the same as your POP3 or IMAP host. If in doubt, contact your ISP or system administrator.
<p>
<li>
In the User Name section, enter your user name and click Next.</li>

<li>
In the Account Name section, assign a name for this account (for
example, "Work" or "Family"), and click Next.</li>
<li>Verify that the information you entered is correct. If necessary, verify the information you entered with your ISP or system administrator.

<li>Click Finish to set up your account.</li>

</ol>

<a NAME="additional_accounts"></a>
<p>You can add additional mail and newsgroup accounts from the File menu of the Mail window by choosing New, then Account. (Or, you can open the Edit menu of the Mail window, choose Mail/News Account Settings, and then click the New Account button.) Be sure to type the account information exactly as it's given to you. Click Next or Back to move through the panels. To cancel your account creation, click Cancel.

Also, Netscape Mail automatically checks the default account for new messages when you first start Mail. (For POP accounts, Mail doesn't download the new messages until you click Get Msg on the Mail window toolbar.) </li>
<li>
To remove an account and its settings, click the Remove Account button.</li>

<a NAME="IMAP_and_POP3"></a>

<h2>Choosing Between IMAP and POP3 Mail Servers</h2>

<p>Netscape Mail can work with two types of mail servers: IMAP and POP3. If your
Internet service provider supports both, these descriptions may help you
choose which one to use:
<h3>Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</h3>
<p><b>Advantages</b>: Your messages and any changes to them stay on your
server, saving local disk space. Also, you always have access to an updated
mailbox, and you can get your mail from multiple locations. Performance
on a modem is faster, since you initially download message headers only.
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Not all ISPs support IMAP.
<h3>Post Office Protocol (POP3)</h3>
<p><b>Advantages</b>: Your messages are downloaded to your local computer
all at once, but you can also specify whether to keep copies of the messages on the server. Most ISPs currently support
POP3.
<p><b>Disadvantages</b>: You must synchronize your local Inbox with your
server's mailbox. This can result in downloading new messages over and
over each time you connect. If you use more than one computer, messages
might reside on one or the other, but not both. POP3 doesn't work as well
as IMAP over a slow link connection. Also, you can't access all mail folders
from multiple locations.

<p>[&nbsp;<a href="#mail_start">Return to beginning of section</a>&nbsp;]</p>

<h2>Composing Mail and Newsgroup Messages</h2>

<p>To open a composition window to address, compose, and send a new message
or reply to one:
<ul>
<li>
In any Netscape  window, open the File menu and choose New,
then Message.
<li>In the Mail window, click New Msg.
<li>While displaying a message, click Reply, Forward, or Reply All on the Mail toolbar.</li>

<li>From the Address Book window, select an address and click New Msg.</li> 

</ul>
<p>
<b>Tip:</b> Use the Mail/News Account Settings command on the Edit menu to specify the HTML text editor for composing messages. In the Account Settings dialog box, select the account, and check "Compose messages in HTML format" to use the HTML text editor for all messages. If you want to use the plain-text editor occasionally, you can hold down the Shift key while clicking the New Msg or the Reply button to use the plain-text editor on an as-needed basis.

<a NAME="NEW_MESSAGE_WINDOW"></a>

<h2>Using the Message Composition Window</h2>

<p>Use the message composition window to address, compose, and send email and
newsgroup messages. First specify whether you want to compose messages
in plain-text or HTML in the <a href="#PREFERENCES_MAILNEWS_IDENTITY">Account
Settings</a> preference panel (Open the Edit menu and choose Mail/News Account Settings).
<p>The message composition window contains the following:
<ul>
<li>
Toolbar.</li>
<p>You can click the following buttons:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<b>Send</b>: To send a completed message.</li>

<li>
<b>Address</b>: To search for names in your address books.</li>

<li>
<b>Attach</b>: To attach a file to a message.</li>

<li>
<b>Spell</b>: To check spelling of your message text.</li>

<li>
<b>Save</b>: To save the message as a draft.</li>

</ul>
<p>
<li>
Attachments field: When you attach files to a message, the file names are listed in the Attachments area to the right of the Addressing area.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you've chosen to compose messages using the HTML editor, you see an additional toolbar with text formatting buttons similar to those in Netscape Composer.
<p>
For help using the message composition window, see the <a href=composer_help.html>Composer</a> online help.

<a NAME="ADDRESSING_MESSAGE"></a>
<h2>Addressing a Message</h2>

<p>To address an email message:
<ol>
<li>
Type the name in the address field.</li>

<p>If you have <a href="#pinpoint">address autocompletion</a> enabled (it's enabled by default), simply type the first few letters of the recipient's name and wait for Mail to
complete the address. (Or you can type part of the name and immediately press Enter to have Mail try to complete the address.)
<li>
If multiple addresses are found, select an address and press Enter.</li>

<p><b>Note</b>: Use a comma to separate multiple addresses on the same
line. Do not use a comma to separate first or last names.
<li>
If you want this message to be <a href="#SENTFROM">sent from a different
account</a>, click "From" to select the account you want.</li>

<li>
If necessary, click "To" to choose a different recipient type:</li>
<ul>
<li><b>To</b>: For primary recipients of your message.</li>

<li><b>Cc</b>: For secondary recipients (carbon copy).</li>

<li><b>Bcc</b>: For secondary recipients not identified to the other recipients, including those in the cc list (blind carbon copy).</li>

<li><b>Reply-To</b>: For recipients to reply to a different email address than the one the message is sent from.</li>

<li><b>Newsgroup</b>: For posting to a newsgroup.</li>

<li><b>Followup-To</b>: For redirecting a newsgroup posting, so that subsequent
replies go directly to the redirected newsgroup instead of the original
newsgroup.</li>
</ul>
</ol>
<p>
<b>Tip</b>: You can quickly address a message by right-clicking the email address
contained in a message you're reading, and then selecting Send Mail To
from the pop-up menu. </p>

<a NAME="SENTFROM"></a>
<p><b>Changing the Account From Which a Message is Sent</b>
<p>
If you have multiple mail accounts, the account listed in the From field
is based on the account (or server) you have currently selected when you
choose to create a new message. However, Netscape Mail also allows you
to change the account a message is sent from while you're composing a message.
Click the From field to view a list of your accounts and then select the
account you want. A copy of the message is saved in the Sent folder associated with the account you sent from.

<a NAME="pinpoint"></a>
<p><b>About Address Autocompletion</b>
<p>Address autocompletion allows you to address mail easily
from the message composition window without having to search for names
or type complete names. Mail automatically checks your address books and an LDAP Directory Server (if available) and completes the name if it finds a unique match. It also prevents mistakes by showing all possible choices with additional information if it finds multiple matches. Address autocompletion is enabled by default.
<p>
If you don't want to use an address that Mail provides, simply press Backspace or Delete to erase the address and then enter an alternate address.

<p>To disable address autocompletion:
<ol>
<li>
Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
<li>Under the Mail and Newsgroups category, click Addressing.
<li>In the Address Autocompletion section, remove the check next to Local Address Books and LDAP Directory Server.
<li>Click OK.
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="SENDING_OPTIONS"></a>

<h2>Selecting Message Sending Options</h2>
<p>While you're composing a message, you can select these additional message
sending options from the Options menu:

<p><b>Select Addresses</b>

<p>The Select Addresses option lets you choose the recipient's email address from your Address
Books. Select an address and then click To:, Cc:, or Bcc: to address your message.

<p><b>Check Spelling</b>

<p>Checks the spelling of the message text. You can also click Spell.

<p><b>Rewrap</b>

<p>If you are composing a message using the plain-text editor, you can use the Rewrap command to rewrap long lines of quoted text to fit the composition window. This command rewraps selected quoted text to the window width, or rewraps all quoted text if no text is selected. This command is primarily useful when you are replying to a message where the original message is quoted in your reply, and the original message contains long lines.

<p>You use the Mail/News Account Settings command on the Edit menu to specify that you want to use the plain-text editor for composing messages. In the Account Settings dialog box, select the account, and uncheck "Compose messages in HTML format" to use the plain-text editor for all messages. If you only want to use the plain-text editor occasionally, you can hold down the Shift key while clicking the Get Msg or the Reply button to use the plain-text editor on an as-needed basis.

<p><b>Format</b>

<p>Send the message as plain text, or HTML (formatted), or both. If you
choose "Auto-Detect," Mail asks you for the format to use if it's unknown
whether the recipient's mail program can display an HTML message. The format you choose here overrides the send format you specified using the Preferences command on the Edit menu.

<p><b>Priority</b>

<p>Choose a label or "flag" that indicates whether the message has lowest,
low, normal, high, or highest priority.

<p><b>File Sent Message</b>

<p>Choose this if you want to file an additional copy of the sent message
in a different folder than your default Sent folder. Then select the folder
you want.

  <h2>Using HTML in Your Messages</h2>
  <p>HTML messages can include formatted text, links, images, and tables, just 
    like a web page. However, some recipients may not be able to receive HTML 
    messages. Netscape Mail allows you to compose mail and newsgroup messages 
    using either the HTML (rich-text) formatting editor or the plain-text editor 
    for each mail account you have. In addition, you can choose whether your addressees 
    should receive HTML or plain-text messages by default, and how Mail should 
    handle messages when it's not known if the addressee(s) can receive HTML formatted 
    mail. 
  <p>To specify whether to use the HTML editor as the default for composing messages: 
  <ol>
    <li> Choose the mail or newsgroup account you want to use.</li>
    <li> Open the Edit menu and choose Mail/News Account Settings.</li>
    <li> Select "Compose messages in HTML format." You see the HTML formatting 
      toolbar in the message composition window. Leave this box unchecked to use 
      the plain-text editor for this account.</li>

    to a different format when you click Send: 
  <p>

        <li>Plain Text Only (may lose formatting such as bold text) 
        <li>Rich Text (HTML) Only (some email programs may have trouble displaying 
          the message) 
        <li>Plain and Rich (HTML) Text (this uses more disk space)

    <li> Click Edit to display the address book card dialog box.</li>
    <li> In the Name tab, for "Prefers to receive messages formatted as", choose

      can only read messages sent as plain text (no formatting), then choose Plain 
      Text. If you don't know or are not sure, choose Unknown. If you choose Unknown, 
      Netscape Mail determines the sending format based on the Send Format settings 
      for Mail in the Preferences dialog box. If Mail still can't determine the 
      correct format, Mail will ask you to choose a sending format when you send

  <h2>About Netscape Mail Address Books</h2>
  <p> Address books store email addresses and contact information for people you 
    typically send email to, such as colleagues, friends, and family. Netscape 
    Mail provides you with two address books: the Personal Address Book, and the 
    Collected Addresses Book, and you can create additional address books as well. 
    The contents of these address books are stored locally on your hard disk. 
    Your address book may also list email addresses from an LDAP directory, which 
    is located on an LDAP Directory server. The Directory server stores email 
    addresses of people that are not included in your locally-stored address books. 
  <h4> Personal Address Book</h4>
  <p> Use the Personal Address Book to add specific names you want, or to import 
    address books from other email programs and previous versions of Netscape. 
    You can create mailing lists, edit individual address entries, and create 
    additional address books. If you have a Netscape WebMail or an AOL account, 
    you can synchronize entries in your Personal Address Book with those in your 
    WebMail or AOL Address Book. 
  <h4> Collected Addresses</h4>
  <p> The Collected Addresses address book automatically collects the email addresses 
    contained in incoming and outgoing messages, as well as the screen names for 
    buddy lists migrated from Netscape Communicator. For incoming email messages, 
    the Collected Addresses address book saves the sender's address in each message 
    as soon as you open it. Addresses from outgoing messages are stored as soon 
    as you click Send. You can choose which addresses you want to collect (only 
    addresses from mail messages or addresses from both mail and newsgroup messages) 
    by changing the <a href="#PREFERENCES_MAILNEWS_ADDRESSING"> preferences for 
    email address collection</a>. 
  <h4>LDAP Directory (if available)</h4>
  <p>An LDAP directory (also known as an address lookup service) stores email 
    addresses of recipients who are not in your locally-stored address books. 
    LDAP directories offer you access to large, centrally maintained databases 
    of email addresses, which is especially useful with <a href="#AUTO_COMPLETE">address 
    autocompletion</a>.</p>
  <p>To enable automatic address collection: 
  <ol start="1">
    <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.</li>
    <li>Under the Mail and Newsgroups category, click Addressing.</li>
    <li>Select Enable Email Address Collection to start collecting addresses.</li>
    <li>Choose whether you want to use this feature for incoming or outgoing messages, 
      or both.</li>
    <li>Choose whether you want to use this feature for newsgroup messages. 
    <li>Choose whether you want to limit the size of the collected address book. 
      The default size is 700 cards. If you add a new card that exceeds the limit, 
      the oldest card is removed and the new card is added, keeping the total 
      number of cards the same.</li>
    <li>Click OK.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>

  <h2>Creating a New Address Book Card</h2>
  <p>Address book cards can be used to store names, postal addresses, email addresses, 
    phone numbers, and information such as whether the addressee prefers to receive 
    plain-text or HTML-formatted messages. 
  <p>To create an address book card for an individual: 
  <ol>
    <li> Click the Address Book icon on the status bar or open the Tasks menu 
      and choose Address Book.</li>
    <li> Click New Card. (If you have multiple address books, select the one to 
      which you want to add a card.)</li>
    <li> Each New Card dialog box has four tabs: 
      <ul>
        <li><b>Name tab</b>: Enter the following information: 
          <ul>
            <li>First and Last (first and last name of person as you want it to 
              appear in the address book). 
            <li> Display name (the name that appears in the "To" field of the 
              composition window) 
            <li>Nickname (a shortcut or alias for the real name)</li>
            <li>Email address (primary and additional address) 
            <li>Prefers to receive messages formatted as: If you know this recipient 
              can read HTML-formatted messages (such as messages that include 
              include links, images, or tables), choose HTML. If this recipient 
              can only read messages sent as plain text (no formatting), then 
              choose Plain Text. If you don't know or are not sure, choose Unknown. 
              If you choose Unknown, Netscape Mail determines the sending format 
              based on the Mail and Newsgroups Send Format settings in the Preferences 
              dialog box. If Mail still can't determine the correct format, Mail 
              will ask you to choose a sending format when you send the message.</li>

          </ul>

          phone number, and URL.</li>
        <li> <b>Instant Messenger tab</b>: Type the person's screen name and choose 
          a Buddy List grouping. 
          <p><b>Note</b>: You must be logged on to Instant Messenger in order 
            to enter information on this tab.

  <h2>Importing Address Books and Mail Messages</h2>
  <p>If you have an address book from a previous version of Netscape Communicator 
    or another email program, you can add its entries to your personal address 
    book. When you import another address book, Mail creates a new address book 
    with the imported entries. 
  <p>You can import address books and mail messages from Eudora, Outlook, and 
    Outlook Express. You can import the following types of address book file formats: 
    tab or comma separated text or LDIF. Netscape Communicator address books use 
    the LDIF format. 
  <p>To export address book entries from Netscape Communicator so you can import 
    them into Netscape 6: 
  <ol>
    <li>In Netscape Communicator, choose Address Book from the Communicator menu. 
    <li>Select the address book that you want to export. 
    <li>From the File menu in the Address Book window, choose Export. 
    <li>Type a name for the exported address book. 
    <li>Choose the LDIF file format. 
    <li>Click Save. Remember the location where you saved the address book file, 
      so you can find it when you're ready to import it into Netscape 6. The file 
      will have a .LDIF extension. 
  </ol>
  <p>To import messages or address book files into Netscape 6: 
  <ol>
    <li>From the File menu in Netscape 6, choose Import.</li>
    <li> Follow the instructions to import mail folders and address book files.</li>
    <li>If you want to import a Netscape Communicator address book, choose "Text" 
      from the list in the second screen of the wizard.

  <h2>Syncing Entries in Your Personal Address Book with Your Netscape WebMail 
    or AOL Address Book</h2>
  <p><b>Note</b>: You must already have an AOL account or a Netscape WebMail account 
    in order to synchronize address books. If you do not yet have a Netscape account, 
    you can sign up for one by going to <i>http://www.netscape.com</i>. You must 
    also add your Netscape WebMail or AOL account to Netscape 6 by following the 
    steps under <a href="#account_settings">Setting Up Additional Mail and News 
    Accounts</a>. 
  <p>If you have added your Netscape WebMail or AOL account, you can save time 
    managing email addresses from those accounts by <i>synchronizing</i> or matching 
    entries in your Netscape WebMail or AOL Address Book with entries in your 
    Netscape Personal Address Book. If you add, edit, or delete an entry in one 
    address book, you can automatically update the other address books so that 
    entries in both address books match. 
  <p>To perform an address book sync: 
  <ol>
    <li>In the Address Book window, click the Sync button on the toolbar or choose 
      Sync Netscape Address Book from the File menu. 
    <li>Mail prompts you to enter the user name and password for the account you 
      want to use for address book synchronization. For example, if you want to 
      synchronize your Personal Address Book with your Netscape WebMail address 
      book, enter your WebMail user name and password. If you want to synchronize 
      your Personal Address Book with your AOL address book, enter your AOL user 
      name and password. 
    <li>Click OK to begin synchronization. 
  </ol>
  <p>You can continue to synchronize your address book throughout your Mail session 
    (without having to log in again). Just click Sync or choose Sync Netscape 
    Address Book from the File menu. However, if you want to synchronize with 
    a different address book, you must first exit Netscape and then restart it. 
    For example, if you've been syncing with your Netscape WebMail address book, 
    and then you decide you want to sync with your AOL address book, you must 
    first exit Netscape and then restart it. When you return to the Address Book 
    window and click the Sync button, you will be able to enter the user name 
    and password for your AOL account.

  <h2>Creating Message Filters</h2>
  <p>Message filters allow you to manage and organize your messages. You can create 
    message filters that Netscape Mail uses to automatically perform certain actions 
    on incoming messages based on criteria you specify. For example, you can create 
    a message filter that automatically files incoming messages in a particular 
    folder. 
  <p>If you are not already viewing the Message Filters dialog box, follow these 
    steps: 
  <p>Begin from the Mail window.</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Open the Edit menu and choose Message Filters.</li>
    <li>If you have multiple mail accounts, choose the one to which you want to 
      apply the filter.</li>
    <li> Click New. You use the Filter Rules dialog box to specify the types of 
      messages to act on, and the action you want the filter to perform.</li>
    <li>Type a name for the filter.</li>
    <li>Select the matching option you want Mail to use: "<i>all</i> of the following 
      conditions" (criteria) you choose, or "at least <i>one</i>" of the conditions. 
    <li>Use the pop-up menus to choose the search criteria (for example, "Subject," 
      "Sender," "contains," "doesn't contain") and then type the text or phrase 
      you want to match.</li>
    <li>To restrict your filter to messages that only match a certain priority, 
      choose an option for priority from the pop-up menu. 
    <li>Click More to add criteria and Fewer to remove them.</li>
    <li> Use the pop-up menu to choose the action you want the filter to perform 
      on the messages (for example, Move to Folder).</li>
    <li>Choose a destination folder in which to store the messages, or create 
      a new folder.</li>
    <li>Click OK to confirm your settings.</li>
    <li>Use the Message Filters dialog box to manage your filters, as follows:</li>
    <ul>
      <li><b>To turn a filter on or off</b>: Click the dot to the right of the 
        filter name to enable it (diamond), or click it again to turn it off.</li>
      <li><b>To edit a filter</b>: Select the filter name and click Edit (or double-click 
        the filter name).</li>
      <li><b>To delete a filter</b>: Select the filter name and click Delete.</li>
      <li><b>To change the order in which filters are applied</b>: In the filter 
        list, click a filter's name, and click the up or down arrow to move it.</li>
      <p><b>Note</b>: Filters are applied to each incoming message in the order 
        you choose, until a filter action results in the message being deleted 
        or moved to a different folder. 
    </ul>
    <li>Click OK when you are done managing your filters. If you created a new 
      filter, it begins filtering incoming messages as soon as you click OK. 
  </ol>
  <p> <b>Note</b>: If you move, delete, or rename a folder that you've been using 
  to store filtered messages, the filter will no longer work. You can either edit 
  the filter to point to a different folder (or to the folder's new location if 
  you've moved it), or else you can turn the filter off or delete it. You can 
  also recreate the destination folder. If you recreate the destination folder, 
  you must also turn the filter back on to activate filtering again. Until then, 
  incoming messages that match the filter criteria will remain in your Inbox. 
  <p> <b>Tip</b>: Filters don't apply to existing messages. If you have existing 
    messages that you want to move to another folder, you can <a href="#SEARCH_MAILNEWS">search</a> 
    for those messages and then <a href="#OPENING_FOLDERS">file</a> them into 
    the other folder.

  <h2>Searching Through Messages</h2>
  <p> Netscape Mail lets you quickly find text in a single message, or use a combination 
    of criteria to perform a thorough search through all messages in a specific 
    mail folder, newsgroup, or account. 
  <p>To locate text in a single message: 
  <p>Begin from the Mail window.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the message, open the Search menu, and choose Find in This Message. 
    <li>Type the text that you want to locate. 
    <li>Click Find to locate the first occurrence. 
    <li>Continue clicking Find to locate additional occurrences, or click Cancel 
      when you are done. 
    <li>Choose Find Again from the Search menu to continue searching for the text 
      throughout the rest of the message.</li>
  </ol>
  <a NAME="SEARCH_MESSAGES"></a> 
  <p>To search mail folders or newsgroups for specific messages: 
  <p><b>Note:</b> This feature cannot be used for Netscape Webmail and AOL accounts, 
    since the servers for those types of accounts do not support this feature. 
  <p>Begin from the Mail window.</p>
  <ol>
    <li> Open the Search menu and choose Search Mail/News Messages.</li>
    <li> Under Criteria, choose the account, newsgroup, or folder that you want 
      to search. For a mail account, click "Search subfolders" to include all 
      subfolders in the search.</li>
    <li> Select the options to allow Mail to search for messages that match all 
      or at least one of the conditions (criteria) that you choose.</li>
    <li>Use the pop-up menus to indicate the search criteria (for example, "Subject," 
      "Sender," "Contains," "Doesn't contain") and then type the text or phrase 
      that you want to match.</li>
    <li>To restrict your search to messages that only match a certain priority 
      and status, choose options for priority and status from the pop-up menus. 
    <li> Click More to add criteria and Fewer to remove them.</li>
    <li> Click Search to begin, or click Clear to reset your entries. The search 
      results appear under Results in the Search Messages dialog box. To open 
      a message so you can read it, select the message and click Open, or double-click 
      the message.</li>
    <li>To sort the messages in a different order, click the column that you want 
      to sort by. 
    <li>To move or copy a message in the Results area to another folder, select 
      the message and then choose the destination folder from the File pop-up 
      menu. If the destination folder is within the same account, the message 
      is moved to that folder. If the destination folder is within a different 
      account, the message is copied to that folder. 
    <li>Click Close when you are done.

  <h2>Setting Up Netscape Mail to Work Offline</h2>
  <p>Netscape Mail's offline feature lets you download your mail and read it offline 
    (while disconnected from the Internet). If you use a dial-up (modem) connection 
    to access your mail and you want to reduce the time you are connected, or, 
    if you need to temporarily disconnect from your company's network while traveling 
    or switching locations, you can download your mail so that you can read it 
    offline. Netscape Mail's offline feature can automatically downloatravellingd 
    incoming messages and then later send all your outgoing messages when you 
    reconnect. 
  <p> If you occasionally want to work offline, Netscape Mail lets you easily: 
  <ul>
    <li>download your Inbox for offline use 
    <li>download an individual folder for offline use 
    <li>download only selected or flagged messages for offline use 
  </ul>
  <p> If you frequently work offline, Netscape Mail also lets you: 
  <ul>
    <li>set up one or more of your accounts for offline use 
    <li>set offline and disk space preferences for each account 
    <li>select the items (accounts, folders, and newsgroups) that you want to 
      view offline 
  </ul>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <a name="OFFLINE_INBOX"></a> 
  <h2>Downloading Your Inbox for Offline Use</h2>
  <p>Netscape Mail can automate the offline process for your Inbox messages. You 
    can tell Netscape Mail to automatically download your Inbox messages for offline 
    use. Later, when you go back online, Netscape Mail automatically synchronizes 
    your Inbox messages with the server. 
  <p>To automatically download your Inbox for offline use: 
  <p>Begin from the Mail window. 
  <ol>
    <li>From the Edit menu, choose Mail/News Account Settings.

      the account that contains the Inbox you want to download for offline use. 
    <li>Check the box labelled "Make the messages in my Inbox available when I 
      am working offline." 
    <li>Click OK. 
    <li>Click Get Msg or select the Inbox to start the download. 
    <li>From the File menu, choose Offline, and then choose Work Offline. 
  </ol>
  <p> Netscape Mail automatically downloads all messages in your Inbox so you 
    can read and respond to them while working offline. After disconnecting, Netscape 
    Mail remains open so you can continue to work with your messages. 
  <p> To reconnect to the Internet so you can work online: 
  <ul>
    <li>From the File menu, choose Offline, and then choose Work Online. 
  </ul>
  <p>When you go back online, Netscape Mail automatically synchronizes your Inbox 
    messages with the server, by replicating any changes you made while working 
    offline. 
  <p><b>Tip</b>: Netscape Mail saves any messages that you send while working 
    offline in the Unsent Messages folder under Local Folders. When you reconnect, 
    choose Send Unsent Messages from the File menu to send all your saved messages 
    at once. To have Netscape Mail automatically send your unsent messages when 
    you reconnect, use the Preferences command on the Edit menu to change your

  </ol>
  <p> Netscape Mail automatically downloads all messages in the selected folder so 
  you can read and respond to them while working offline. After disconnecting, 
  Netscape Mail remains open so you can continue to work with your messages. 
  <p><b>Note:</b> Message headers that have been downloaded for reading offline 
    display a special offline indicator. 
  <p> To reconnect to the Internet so you can work online: 
  <ol>
    <li>From the File menu, choose Offline, and then choose Work Online. 
    <li>From the File menu, choose Download/Sync Now, and click OK.

  <h2>Setting Up Your Accounts for Working Offline</h2>
  <p>To set up one or more accounts for working offline, you use the Offline and 
    Disk Space preferences in the Mail/News Account Settings dialog box. Once 
    set, you don't need to change these preferences each time you want to work 
    offline. The offline and disk space preferences you can set for an account 
    depend on the type of account (IMAP, POP, or Newsgroup). 
  <p> Here's a summary of the steps you will follow to set up your accounts for 
    offline use:

  <ul>
    <li>Choose the font you prefer for viewing plain-text messages: fixed width 
      or variable width.</li>
    <p>Choosing a font style for quoted plain-text messages can help you more 
      easily distinguish quoted text (usually a message that's been forwarded 
      to you or by you). To customize the display of quoted plain text:</p>
    <ul>

      to fit the width of your mail window.</li>
    <li>Select "Display emoticons as graphics" so that when you receive messages 
      that contain emoticons (also called smiley faces) Mail can convert them 
      to graphics, for example:

    This is recommended if it's likely you might receive messages in which the 
    character set is not indicated, such as when reading messages in international 
    newsgroups. To apply the default character coding to all messages, select 
    "Apply default to all messages". 
  <p> <b>Tip</b>: You can later view or change the character set coding (language)

  <a NAME="PREFERENCES_MAILNEWS_FORMATTING"></a> 
  <h2>Setting Preferences for Formatting Messages</h2>
  <p>If you regularly compose HTML (formatted) email messages, keep in mind that 
    sometimes not all recipients use email programs that can display HTML formatting 
    properly. Netscape Mail lets you specify how you want to format messages that 
    go to those recipients: convert them to plain text, format them only as HTML, 
    or format them as both HTML and plain text. These preferences apply to all 
    your mail accounts, but only to email messages and not to newsgroup messages. 
  <p>Whenever you add a person or address card to your address book, you can specify 
    whether that addressee can receive HTML-formatted messages. However, when 
    this information is unknown, you can set general preferences for how Mail 
    formats these messages. 
  <p>If you are not already viewing the Send Format settings, follow these steps: 
  <ol>
    <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.</li>
    <li>Under the Mail and Newsgroups category, click Send Format.</li>
    <li>Choose one of the following options: 
      <ul>
        <li> Ask me what to do (Mail prompts you to choose a format before you 
          send the message)</li>
        <li> Convert the message to plain text (may lose formatting such as bold 
          text)</li>
        <li>Send the message in HTML anyway (some email programs may have trouble 
          displaying the message)</li>
        <li> Send the message in both plain text and HTML (this uses more disk 
          space)</li>
      </ul>
      You can always override these settings for an individual message by using 
      the Options menu in the message composition window. 
    <li>Under HTML and Plain Text Domains, add the domain names that you typically 
      send mail to, if you know which domains can display HTML-formatted mail 
      messages, and which domains can only display plain text. 
      <p> For example, if you typically send mail to multiple recipients that 
        have the same domain name (for example, your colleagues all have email 
        addresses that end in "netscape.net"), and you know that this domain name 
        is capable of displaying HTML messages, then you can add the netscape.net 
        domain to the list of HTML Domains so that Mail will automatically send 
        messages in HTML format to these recipients. Similarly, if you typically 
        send mail to recipients at a domain that you know can only receive Plain 
        Text messages, you can add that domain name to the list of Plain Text 
        domains, so that Mail automatically sends messages to that domain in plain-text 
        format.

  <h2>Setting Preferences for Addressing</h2>
  <p>This section describes how to set preferences for Netscape Mail's address 
    books (for example, email address collection and address autocompletion). 
    If you are not already viewing the Addressing settings, follow these steps: 
  <ol>
    <li>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences. 
    <li>Under the Mail and Newsgroups category, select Addressing. 
  </ol>
  <p><b>Email Address Collection</b> 
  <p>In addition to your Personal Address Book, Netscape Mail provides you with 
    a Collected Addresses Book that can automatically store email addresses from 
    your incoming or outgoing messages, or both. For incoming email messages, 
    Mail stores the addresses in each message as soon as you open it. Addresses 
    from outgoing messages are stored as soon as you click Send. 
  <ol>
    <li>Choose whether you want to use this feature for incoming or outgoing messages, 
      or both. 
    <li>Choose whether you want to use this feature when reading newsgroup messages. 
    <li>Choose whether you want to limit the size of the collected address book. 
      The default size is 700 cards. If you add a new card that exceeds the limit, 
      the oldest card is removed and the new card is added, keeping the total 
      number of cards the same.</li>
    <li>Click OK.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><b>Note</b>: Your changes take effect the next time you start Netscape. 
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <a NAME="AUTO_COMPLETE"></a> 
  <p><b>Address Autocompletion</b> 
  <p>Address autocompletion allows you to quickly address mail without having 
    to search for names or type names completely. Simply type a few characters, 
    and Mail automatically checks your local address books and the LDAP Directory 
    Server (if available) and completes the name if it finds a unique match. If 
    multiple matches are found, Mail shows you a list of all possible choices. 
  <ol>
    <li>Check Local Address Books to have Mail autocomplete email addresses by 
      looking for matching entries in your Personal Address Book, Collected Addresses 
      Book, and any other local address books you may have. 
    <li>Check Directory Server and choose a directory server from the list to 
      have Mail look for matching entries in an address book located on an LDAP 
      Directory Server. A Directory Server lets you look up addresses that are 
      not stored in one of your local address books. See <a href="#ADD_LDAP">Adding 
      and Removing LDAP Directories</a> for information on setting LDAP directory 
      server settings. 
      <p><b>Note</b>: Directory server settings you enter from the Preferences 
        dialog box apply to all your mail accounts. You can override these settings 
        for individual accounts by specifying different LDAP directory servers 
        or server settings using the Addressing settings for an account in the 
        Account Settings dialog box. 
    <li>Check "Do not search in the directory" if you want a matching entry from 
      your local address books to take precedence over a matching entry in an 
      LDAP directory. If you uncheck this option, Mail shows you a list of all 
      possible matches from your local address books and directory servers, so 
      you can choose the one you want. 
    <li>Click OK.

              and one level below the base DN. 
            <li><b>Sub</b>: Retrieves matching entries by searching the base DN 
              in addition to all levels below the base DN. This is the least restrictive 
              search.
