Using the Cookie Manager</h1>

<p>A cookie is a small amount of information on your computer that is used by some web sites. For a brief overview, see <a href="privacy_help.html#privacy_cookies">What Are Cookies and How Do They Work?</a>

<p>Before loading a web page that uses cookies, your browser handles the page's cookies by doing two things:

<ul>
<li>Accepts or rejects any requests by the web site to <b>set</b> (store) one or more cookies on your computer.
<li>Accepts or rejects any requests by the web site to <b>read</b> cookies it previously stored on your computer. A web site can't actually read cookies or any other data on your computer&mdash;instead, your browser gets the cookies and sends them back to the web site.
</ul>

<a NAME="privacy_levels"></a>
<a NAME="cookies:privacy_levels_forIDX"></a>
<h2>Setting Privacy Levels</h2>

<p>Many web sites publish their privacy policies according to the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) standard. A web site's privacy policy describes what kind of information the site collects, to whom it gives that information, and how it uses the information. 

<p>You can choose to enable cookies based on the browser's privacy settings and the P3P standard. When cookies are enabled in this manner, the browser checks your current privacy settings against those published by the web site and takes appropriate action. 

<p>For example, your privacy settings may require the browser to reject cookies that collect personal information without informing you. Alternatively, you can adjust your privacy settings so that the browser simply warns you when a cookie is used in this way, while allowing the action to take place.

<p>The browser defines three levels of privacy: low, medium, and high. You can select one of these predefined privacy levels, or you can create your own custom privacy policy.

<p>To control the privacy settings you want your browser to enforce for all web sites:

<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
<li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, choose Cookies. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand the list.)
<li>Select the option labeled &quot;Enable cookies based on privacy settings.&quot;
<li>Click View.
<li>In the Privacy Settings dialog box, select the level of privacy you want, or select &quot;custom&quot; and define your own privacy policy as discussed below.
<li>Click OK to confirm your settings.
</ol>

<p>Your browser handles cookies according to the settings you select. For the low, medium, and high options, these settings are standardized. 

<p>When the &quot;custom&quot; option is selected, you can define your own privacy policy. For each type of site listed under Cookie Acceptance Policy, and for each type of cookie, you can select whether you want the Cookie Manager to accept the cookie permanently, reject it permanently, accept it just for the current session (that is, until you exit the browser), or flag it.

<p>If you choose Flag for a given category, the Cookie Manager displays the cookie notification icon near the lower-right corner of the browser window whenever a web site that fits the category sets a cookie. When this icon is displayed, you can click it to get information about the affected cookies.

<p>"First party cookies" are cookies set by the site you are visiting. &quot;Third party cookies,&quot; also known as <a href="privacy_help.html#privacy_foreign">foreign cookies</a>, are set by a sites other than the one you are viewing, and are therefore considered more dangerous.

<h3>Level of Privacy</h3>

<p>The level of privacy you set here determines how your browser treats cookies according to privacy policies published by some web sites and the settings displayed under Cookie Acceptance Policy for first-party and third-party cookies. 

<p>&quot;First-party cookies&quot; are cookies set by the site you are visiting. &quot;Third-party cookies,&quot; also known as <a href="privacy_help.html#privacy_foreign">foreign cookies</a>, are set by a site other than the one you are viewing, and are considered more dangerous than first party cookies.

<p>You can select one of the following privacy levels:
<ul>
	<li><b>low:</b> Select this if you're not too concerned about cookies. When this setting is selected, the Cookie Manager accepts all first party cookies permanently, without regard for a site's privacy policy. 

	<p>It also accepts all third-party cookies. However, in the case of sites that may be collecting information without your consent, the Cookie Manager also <b>flags</b> the third-party cookie&mdash;that is, displays the cookie notification icon near the lower-right corner of the browser window. You can click the cookie notification icon to see more detailed information about the flagged cookies.
	<li><b>medium:</b> Select this if you want to accept and flag both first-party and third-party cookies set by sites that may be collecting personally identifiable information without your consent.
	<li><b>high:</b> Select this if you want the same settings as medium, with the following differences:</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Accept and flag, for the current session only, third-party cookies that don't ask for your consent at all.
		<li>Accept and flag third-party cookies from web sites that provide a web page where you can withhold your consent, but don't ask explicitly for it each time.
	</ul>
	<li><b>custom:</b> Select this only if you want to set your own custom Cookie Acceptance Policy. The default settings for &quot;custom&quot; are the same as for &quot;high.&quot; You can modify them by selecting from the drop-down menus in the Cookie Acceptance Policy portion of the dialog box.
</ul>
<p>To see the exact effect of each privacy level setting, select it and then examine the Cookie Acceptance Policy settings.


<p>&nbsp;</p>


<a name="cookie_acceptance"></a>
<h3>Cookie Acceptance Policy</h3>

<p>If you select the <b>custom</b> option in the top portion of the Privacy Settings dialog box, you can choose one of four settings from the drop-down list in each of the eight categories shown in the bottom portion. These settings cause Cookie Manager to perform the following actions: 

<ul>
	<li><b>Accept:</b> Permanently accept all cookies in the category.
	<li><b>Session:</b> Accept all cookies in the category for the current session only&mdash;that is, until you exit the browser.
	<li><b>Reject:</b> Permanently reject all cookies in the category.
	<li><b>Flag:</b> Accept all cookies in the category, but display the cookie notifiation icon each time it does so.
</ul>

<p>The cookie notification icon appears near the lower-right corner of the browser window. You can click it to get information about the affected cookies or modify your privacy settings.
 

<p>There are four categories for each of the two types of cookies:

<ul>
	<li><b>Site has no privacy policy:</b> Site does not publish any kind of privacy policy. There is  no way of knowing what kinds of information such sites collect or what they do with it. In general, it's safest to reject cookies set by such sites, especially third-party cookies.
	<li><b>Site collects personally identifiable information without your consent:</b> Site publishes a privacy policy, but does not ask your permission when it collects information about your online activities. If you are concerned about such information being collected without your knowledge, you should reject cookies from such sites, especially third-party cookies.
	<li><b>Site collects personally identifiable information with only your implicit consent:</b> Site collects information about you unless you go to a web page and explicitly withhold your consent.
	<li><b>Site does not collect personally identifiable information without your explicit consent:</b> This kind of site is relatively less dangerous, since you are warned, and given a chance to reject the request, each time such a site attempts to collect information about you. As for the other types of sites, third-party cookies are considered more dangerous than first party cookies.
</ul>


<a name="cookie_notify"></a><hr><h2>Cookie Notification</h2>

<p>The cookie notification icon is located in the status bar near the lower-right corner of the browser window. It appears when a web site has used a cookie in a way that requires you to be notified according to your current <a href="#privacy_levels_window">Privacy Settings</a>.

<p>This section describes how to use the Cookie Notification dialog box, which appears when you click the Cookie Notification icon. You can take the following actions from this dialog box:

<ul>	
	<li><b>Turn Off Privacy Settings.</b> Click this button to disable your Privacy Settings. This has the same effect as selecting &quot;Enable all cookies&quot; in <a href="#cookie_prefs">Privacy &amp; Security Preferences - Cookies</a>. After you take this action, your browser will accept all cookies without warning you.
	<li><b>View Cookie Manager.</b> Click this button to open the Cookie Manager, where you can view the current status of all your cookies and identify the cookies that caused the notification icon to appear. Clicking this button also removes the cookie notification icon from the status bar.
	<li><b>View Privacy Settings.</b> Click this button to open the Privacy Settings dialog box. The settings in this dialog box determine how web sites can use cookies on your computer and what actions cause the cookie notification icon to be displayed.
	<li><b>Close.</b> Click this button to exit the Cookie Notification dialog box without taking any action. The cookie notification icon remains visible until you open the Cookie Manager to view your cookie status.
</ul>

<hr><h1>Using the Password Manager</h1>

<p>Many web sites require you to type a user name and password before you can enter the site. For instance, personalized pages and web sites containing your financial information require you to log in.</p>

<p>The user name and password you use at a particular site can be read by the site's administrator. If this concerns you, you may wish to use a different password at every site with which you register. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to remember every single password you've ever used.

<p>Password Manager can help you by storing your user names and passwords on your computer's hard disk, and entering them for you automatically when you visit such sites.</p>

<h2>Using Password Manager to Remember User Names and Passwords</h2>

<p>When Password Manager is turned on, it gives you an opportunity to save user names and passwords that you enter while using the Internet. 

<p>For example, when you log onto your email account or a web site that requries a password, a dialog box appears asking, &quot;Do you want Password Manager to remember this logon?&quot; When you see this dialog box, you can click one of the following buttons:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Yes:</b> The next time you return to the web site you'll see that your user name and password are already filled in.</li>

<li><b>Never for this site:</b> Password Manager will not ask in the future if you want to save your user name and password for that site.</li>

<li><b>No:</b> Password Manager won't remember the user name and password, but will ask again the next time you visit the site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Password Manager saves your user names and passwords on your own computer in a file that's difficult, but not impossible, for an intruder to read. See <a href="#using_encrypt">Encrypting Stored Sensitive Information</a> for information on protecting your stored user names and passwords with encryption technology.

<p>If the Password Manager dialog box described above does not appear when you click Submit after typing your user name and password, Password Manager may be turned off. To turn it on, follow the instructions at <a href="#passwords_onoff">Turning Password Manager On and Off</a>. 

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="passwords_auto"></a>
<h2>Entering User Names and Passwords Automatically</h2>

<p>If you use Password Manager to remember your user name and password for a web site, the next time you visit the site, Password Manager will automatically fill in your user name and password on the site's log in screen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="passwords_onoff"></a>
<h2>Turning Password Manager On and Off</h2>

<p>Password Manager is on by default. To turn it off:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
<li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, choose Passwords. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand the list.)
<li>In the Password Manager section, deselect &quot;Remember passwords for sites that require me to log in&quot; to turn Password Manager off.
</ol>

<p>To turn Password Manager on, follow steps 1 and 2 above, but select the checkbox in step 3 rather than deselecting it.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="passwords_view"></a>
<h2>Managing Stored Passwords</h2>

<p>To see a list of the user names and passwords you have stored:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Tools menu, choose Privacy &amp; Security, and then choose Password Manager.
<li>Select Manage Stored Passwords from the submenu. You see the Password Manager window.</li>
<li>Click the Passwords Saved tab. You see a list of all the stored sites and user names. (Passwords are not listed.)</li> 
<ul>
	<li>To remove a user name, click it and then click Remove. The next time you visit the web site, you will be asked to enter your password.</li>
	<li>Click the Passwords Never Saved tab to see a list of the web sites for which you instructed Password Manager never to store user names. To remove a web site from this list, click it and then click Remove. The next time you visit the web site, you will be asked if you want Password Manager to save the user name and password for that site.</li>

<p>There are two ways to save personal data:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each time you submit an online form that you've filled out, Form Manager asks if you want the information saved. Click Yes. 

<p>Note that Form Manager prompts you only if its automatic notification feature is turned on. For details, see <a href="#form_notify">Turning Off Form Manager Notification</a>.

<li>After you fill out a form (but before you submit it), open the Edit menu and choose Save Form Info.

</ul>

<p>When Form Manager asks if you want to save values that you've entered in a form (the first method described above), it gives you three options:

<ul>
	<li><b>Yes.</b> Click this button to save the information you entered. In the future, you can automatically fill in a form that requests the same information.</li>

	<li><b>Never for this site.</b> Click this button to ensure that Form Manager will not ask in the future if you want to save information that you enter in forms at this site. 

<p>You may want to do this if you want to ensure that you'll always have to enter sensitive information manually at a particular sit. You can change your mind later if you like; for details, see <a href="#form_sites_view_edit">Editing Stored Site Information</a>.

	<li><b>No.</b> Form Manager won't save the information you entered, but will ask again the next time you enter form information at this site.
</ul>

<p>Form Manager stores your personal data on your own computer in a file that's difficult, but not impossible, for an intruder to read. See <a href="#using_encrypt">Encrypting Stored Sensitive Information</a> for information on protecting your information with encryption technology.

<h2>Filling Out Forms Automatically</h2>

<p>To fill out an online form automatically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the online form you want to fill out.
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Fill in Form. 

<p>Note that the Prefill Form menu item won't be accessible if the Form Manager hasn't yet stored any relevant information.


<li>A dialog box called Prefill Form Data appears. This shows exactly what information Form Manager is about to fill in. You can use this dialog box as follows:</li>
<ul>
<li>To prevent a field from being filled in automatically, deselect the checkbox beside it. 

<li>To prevent any fields from being filled in automatically, click Cancel.</li>

</ul>

<li>Click OK to confirm your choices. Form Manager then fills in the form as you specified.

</ol>

<p>For more details on using the Prefill Form Data dialog box, see <a href="#forms_prefill">Prefill Form Data</a>.

<h2>Controlling Your Privacy</h2>

<p>If you provide personal information such as your name, phone number, or email address to a web site, it is free to store that information and use it later. A web site might use your information to improve its service to you or target advertising to your interests. Or it could sell your information to other companies.

<p>Before providing personal information on an online form, you must decide whether or not you trust the web site&mdash;just as you judge whether or not you trust a catalog company before you provide your credit card number on the company's order form.

<p>One way to evaluate a web site's trustworthiness is to examine its published privacy policy. Many web sites publish such policies according to the Platform for Privacy Preferences (P3P) standard. 

<p>A web site's privacy policy describes what kind of information the site collects, to whom it gives that information, and how it uses the information. Web sites publish privacy policies in both human-readable form and as an XML file that can be interpreted by the browser according to your <a href="#privacy_levels_window">Privacy Settings</a>.

<p>To check a web site's privacy policy, browse to the site and follow these steps: 

<ul>
	<li>Open the View menu and choose Page info.
	<li>Click the Privacy tab.
	<li>Click these buttons to see the corresponding information:</li>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Policy:</b> Click this button to view the site's published privacy policy on the web.
		<li><b>Summary:</b> Click this button to view a summary of the site's built-in XML policy file, which defines the site's policies in detail.
		<li><b>Options:</b> Click this button to view a web page provided by the site where you can choose to withhold or grant your consent to certain kinds of information gathering.
	</ul>
</ul>

<p>Many web pages are made up of a variety of text, images, advertisements, and other elements, some of which may be controlled by different companies. 

<p>To view the same information for any individual element of the web page: 
<ol>
	<li>Double-click the categories to see addresses for individual components.
	<li>Select the component whose privacy policy you want to examine
	<li>Click the buttons as described above.
</ol>

<p>For more information on controlling your privacy, see <a href="#privacy_levels">Setting Privacy Levels</a>.

<p>If you use Password Manager or Form Manager to save passwords and personal data, then this sensitive information is stored on your computer in a file that's difficult, but not impossible, for an intruder to read.</p>

<p>If you are not concerned about unauthorized use of your computer, you may not need further security. However, if your computer is in an area where unauthorized people have access to it, it's possible for a determined person to read the file containing your sensitive information.</p>

<p>For a greater degree of security, you may want to protect the file with encryption. Encryption makes it nearly impossible for an unauthorized person to view your stored sensitive information.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="encrypt_on"></a>
<h2>Turning Encryption On and Off</h2>

<p>To turn on encryption for your stored sensitive information:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
<li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, choose Passwords. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand the list.)
<li>In the Encrypting versus Obscuring section, select &quot;Use encryption when storing sensitive data.&quot; 
<li>Click OK. If you haven't previously set a master password, a new dialog box appears and leads you through the process of setting it. 
</ol>

<p>To turn encryption off, deselect &quot;Use encryption when storing sensitive data.&quot; 

<p>You must supply your master password when you turn encryption on or off.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="encrypt_master"></a>
<a NAME="Password_Manager:master_password_andIDX"></a>
<h2>Setting a Master Password</h2>

<p>If you choose to encrypt your stored sensitive information, you'll need a master password. With encryption selected, you'll be asked for your master password at least once during a browser session in which you access any of your stored sensitive information.</p>

<p>If you choose encryption, but don't already have a master password, you'll be prompted to create one the first time you try to save or retrieve your sensitive information.</p>

<p>If your master password has not previously been set, you can set it yourself:

<ol>
<li>Open the Tools menu, choose Privacy &amp; Security, and then choose Password Manager.</li>
<li>Select Change Master Password from the submenu. You see the Set Master Password dialog box.
<li>Enter your new master password, and retype it to confirm the spelling.</li>
<li>Click OK.
</ol>

<p>Make sure your new password is difficult to guess. For some guidelines, see the online document <a href="http://home.netscape.com/security/basics/passwords.html" TARGET="_blank">Choosing a Good Password</a>.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="encrypt_change"></a>
<h2>Changing Your Master Password</h2>


<p>To change your master password:
<ol>
<li>Open the Tools menu, choose Privacy &amp; Security, and then choose Password Manager.</li>
<li>Select Change Master Password from the submenu. You see the Set Master Password dialog box.
<li>Enter your current master password (if you have previously set one). </li>
<li>Enter your new master password, and retype it to confirm the spelling.</li>
<li>Click OK.
</ol>

<p>Make sure your new password is difficult to guess. For some guidelines, see the online document <a href="http://home.netscape.com/security/basics/passwords.html" TARGET="_blank">Choosing a Good Password</a>.



<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="encrypt_logout"></a>
<h2>Logging Out of Your Master Password</h2>

<p>Normally, you are asked for your master password once during each browser session during which you access any of your stored sensitive information. However, you can log out of your master password so that it must be entered again before any sensitive information can be stored or retrieved. This is useful if you are going to leave your computer unattended for a period of time.</p>

<p>To log out of your master password:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Tools menu, choose Privacy &amp; Security, and then choose Password Manager.
<li>Select Log Out from the submenu.</li>
</ol>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="encrypt_forget"></a>
<a NAME="master_password:forgettingIDX"></a>
<h2>What to Do If You Forget Your Master Password</h2>

<p>If you forget your master password, you won't be able to access any of the stored password and form data that it protects. Your master password is your most important password. Make sure you remember it or record it in a safe place.

<p>As a last resort, it's possible to reset your master password if you are sure you can't remember it. However, resetting your master password permanently erases all the web passwords, email passwords, and form data saved on your behalf by Password Manager and Form Manager. You will also lose all your personal certificates associated with the <a href="glossary.html#software_security_device">software security device</a>.

<p>Before taking this drastic action, read <a href="passwords_help.html#Reset_Master_Password">Reset Master Password</a>.

<p>If you are sure you can't remember or retrieve your master password, follow these instructions to reset it:

<ol>
	<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
	<li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, choose Master Passwords. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand the list.)
	<li>Click Reset Master Password.
	<li>In the Reset Master Password dialog box, click Reset.
</ol>

<h3>Form Manager</h3>

<p>When you fill out an online form and click Submit, Form Manager normally displays a dialog box that asks if you want it to save the form data you just entered. 

<p>If you click Yes at least some of the time, Form Manager will soon have enough data to begin filling out forms automatically.

<p>Form preferences allow you to

<ul>

	<li><b>Save form data from web pages when completing forms:</b> Select this checkbox if you want to be asked whether to save form data every time you fill in a new form. If this option is not selected, Form Manager never asks if you want to save form data.

	<p>Note that deselecting this option turns off the notification feature, but not Form Manager. The form data it may have already collected is still available.

<p>This section describes how to use the dialog box that allows you to edit data saved on your behalf by Form Manager. If you are not already viewing it, follow these steps:
<ol>
	<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
   	<li>Under the Privacy &amp; Security category, click Forms. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click Privacy &amp; Security to expand the list.)
	<li>Click Manage Sites.
</ol>

<p>The Form Manager window for managing sites has two tabs:

<ul>
	<li><b>Forms Never Previewed:</b> Click this tab to view the list of sites for which you selected &quot;Bypass this screen when prefilling this form in the future&quot; after choosing Prefill Form from the Edit menu. 

	<p>If you remove an entry from this list, Form Manager will again give you an opportunity to review form data for that site before filling it in.
	<li><b>Forms Never Saved:</b> Click this tab to view the list of sites for which you selected &quot;Never for this  
site&quot; in response to the Form Manager's request to store form data. 

	<p>If you remove an entry from this list, Form Manager will again ask whether to store form data when you fill in forms at that site (assuming that the main Form Manager notification option has been selected in <a href="#forms_prefs">Privacy &amp; Security Preferences - Forms</a>).

</ul>

<p>Regardless of which tab you are viewing, you can remove entries from the list as follows:

<ul>

	<li><b>Remove:</b> Select one or more entries that you want to remove, then click this button to remove them. 
	<li><b >Remove All:</b> Click this button to remove all the entries for the tab you are viewing.

</ul>

<p>See the descriptions of each tab above for the consequences of removing entries.

<a NAME="forms_prefill"></a>
<hr><h2>Prefill Form Data</h2>

<p>This section describes the window that normally appears when you open the Edit menu and choose Prefill Form Data. 

<p>However, the Prefill Form Data menu item is enabled only if you have previously used Form Manager to save some form data and are now viewing a web page that is requesting some of the same data. For step-by-step instructions on working with form data, see <a href="#using_forms">Using the Form Manager</a>.

<p>The Prefill Form Data window allows you to perform these actions:

<ul>
	<li><b>Click in a field to edit the displayed data:</b> Any changes you make here will be reflected in the data used to fill in this form, but won't change your stored data.
	<li><b>Select alternative data:</b> Click the arrow on the right side off any field to display a drop-down menu for that field. If you have previously used Form Manager to save alternate information, for example a different mailing address, the available alternates are listed in the menu.
	<li><b>Check the items that you would like to have prefilled:</b> Only the items with checkmarks beside them will be filled in automatically. When you first open the window, all the items are checked. Click to deselect any that you don't want filled in automatically.
	<li><b>Bypass this screen when prefilling this form in the future:</b> Select this checkbox to avoid seeing this window the next time you visit this web site. This can be conveninent, for example, if you frequently need to enter the same data at the same web site and don't need to check it every time before Form Manager fills it in for you.
	<p>If you change your mind about this decision, you can restore the Prefill Form Data window for this web site. For details, see <a href="#forms_sites">Form Manager - Sites</a>.
