<p><a name="cache"></a>
<b>cache.</b>&nbsp;A collection of web page copies stored on your computer's hard disk. The browser accumulates these copies as you browse the Web. When you click a link or type an <a href="#Uniform_Resource_Locator_(URL)">URL</a> to fetch a particular web page for which the cache already contains a copy, the browser compares the cached copy to the original. If there have been no changes, the browser uses the cached copy rather than refetching the original, saving processing and download time. <p>



<A NAME="certificate"></A><A NAME="1018895">
<B>certificate.</B>&nbsp;
</A><A NAME="1018896">
The digital equivalent of an ID card. A certificate specifies the name of an individual, company, or other entity and certifies that a public key, which is included in the certificate, belongs to that entity. When you digitally sign a message or other data, the digital signature for that message is created with the aid of the private key that corresponds to the public key in your certificate. A certificate is issued and digitally signed by a <a href="glossary.html#1020903">certificate authority (CA)</a>. A certificate's validity can be verified by checking the CA's <a href="glossary.html#1013995">digital signature</a>. Also called digital ID, digital passport, public-key certificate X.509 certificate, and security certificate. See also <a href="glossary.html#1019178">public-key cryptography</a>.<P>

</A><A NAME="1020904">
A service that issues a certificate after verifying the identity of the person or entity the certificate is intended to identify. A CA also renews and revokes certificates and generates a list of revoked certificates at regular intervals. CAs can be independent vendors (such as the CAs listed at <a href="https://certs.netscape.com/" TARGET="_blank">Client Certificates</a>) or a person or organization using certificate-issuing server software (such as Mozilla Certificate Management System).

</A><A NAME="1019929">
A hierarchical series of certificates signed by successive certificate authorities. A CA certificate identifies a <a href="glossary.html#1020903">certificate authority (CA)</a> and is used to sign certificates issued by that authority. A CA certificate can in turn be signed by the CA certificate of a parent CA and so on up to a <a href="glossary.html#1015631">root CA</a>. <P>
</A>

<A NAME="certificate_fingerprint"></A><A NAME="1020297">
<B>certificate fingerprint.</B>&nbsp;
</A><A NAME="1020326">
A unique number associated with a certificate. The number is not part of the certificate itself but is produced by applying a mathematical function to the contents of the certificate. If the contents of the certificate change, even by a single character, the function produces a different number. Certificate fingerprints can therefore be used to verify that certificates have not been tampered with.<P>

<A NAME="Certificate_Manager"></A>
<B>Certificate Manager</B>&nbsp;

A list of revoked certificates that is generated and signed by a <a href="glossary.html#1020903">certificate authority (CA)</a>. You can download the latest CRL to your browser or to a server, then check against it to make sure that certificates are still valid before permitting their use for authentication. <P>
</A>


<A NAME="certificate_verification"></A><A NAME="1025527">
<B>certificate verification.</B>&nbsp;
</A><A NAME="1025531">
When <a href="#Certificate_Manager">Certificate Manager</a> verifies a certificate, it confirms that the digital signature was created by a CA whose own CA certificate is both on file with Certificate Manager and marked as trusted for issuing that kind of certificate. It also confirms that the certificate being verified has not itself been marked as untrusted. Finally, if the <a href="glossary.html#1029304">Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP)</a> has been activated, Certificate Manager also performs an online check. It does so by looking up the certificate in a list of valid certificates maintained at a URL that is specified either in the certificate itself or in the browser's validation preferences. If any of these checks fail, Certificate Manager marks the certificate as unverified and won't recognize the identity it certifies.<P>

</A><A NAME="1013996">
A code created from both the data to be signed and the private key of the signer. This code is unique for each new piece of data. Even a single comma added to a message changes the digital signature for that message. Successful validation of your digital signature by appropriate software not only provides evidence that you approved the transaction or message, but also provides evidence that the data has not changed since you digitally signed it. A digital signature has nothing to do with a handwritten signature, although it can sometimes be used for similar legal purposes.
