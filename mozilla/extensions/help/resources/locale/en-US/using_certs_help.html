<h1>Using Certificates</h1>

<p>A certificate is the digital equivalent of an ID card. Just as you may have several ID cards for different purposes, such as a driver's license, an employee ID card, or a credit card, you can have several certificates that are used to identify you for different purposes.</p>

<P>In addition to certificates that identify you, your browser can keep certificates on file that identify other people or organizations. These allow you to control, for example, which web sites you trust for financial transactions.</P>

<P>This section describes how to examine and configure the certificates you have on file. For an overview of the way certificates work, see <b>[xref to Certificates and Network Security].</b> When you are using Certificate Manager windows, you can also obtain more detailed instructions by clicking the Help button in the lower-right corner of each window.</P>

<h2>Get Your Own Certificate</h2>

<P>Much like a credit card or a driver's license, a <i>certificate</i> is a form of identification you can use to identify yourself over the Internet and other networks. Like other commonly used personal IDs, a certificate is typically issued by an organization with recognized authority to issue such identification. An organization that issues certificates is called a <i>certificate authority.</i> 

<p>Once you have obtained a certificate, you store it in a <i>security device.</i> Your browser comes with its own built-in software security device. A security device can also be a piece of hardware, such as a smart card.</p>

<p>To get a certificate, go to the URL for any certificate authority and follow the on-screen instructions for obtaining a certificate. For a list of certificate authorities, see <a href="https://certs.netscape.com/" TARGET="_blank">Client Certificates</a>. </p>
