<h2>What Is Instant Messenger?</h2>

<p>Netscape Instant Messenger is an easy way to communicate instantly with
your friends who are online. You can:

<ul>
<li>Send instant messages to an online buddy. These messages are different
from email, because if your buddy has Instant Messenger open on his or
her machine, your message will appear immediately on your buddy's screen.</li>
<li>Create a "buddy list" of online friends who you want to receive your instant
messages. Instant Messenger helps you locate your buddies so you can add
them to your list.</li>
<li>Control who communicates with you through the buddy controls feature.</li>
<li>Chat with groups of friends and family members in your own private chat room.</li>
<li>Control who communicates with you through the buddy privacy feature.</li>
<li>Find your buddies by email address.</li>
<li>Warn users who send you offensive or annoying messages.</li>
</ul>


<p>[ <a href="#im_start">Return to beginning of section</a> ]


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a NAME="im_setup"></a>
<h2>Setting Up</h2>

<p>To get started quickly, use the Instant Messenger Setup screens.

<ol>
<li>
If the Netscape Instant Messenger Buddy List isn't already on your screen,
open the Tasks menu and choose Instant Messenger, or click the Buddy List tab on the Sidebar.</li>
<li>
Click Setup.</li>
<li>
Follow the steps in the Instant Messenger Setup screens. Before you can use Instant Messenger, you must register a screen name. The Setup screens lead you through the process.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>[ <a href="#im_start">Return to beginning of section</a> ]

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_regist"></a>
<h2>Registering New Screen Names</h2>

<p>When you set up Instant Messenger for the first time using the Instant Messenger Setup screens, you register and select a screen name and password. In subsequent Instant Messenger sessions, you can register multiple screen names to use with the Netscape Instant Messenger service. 

<p>To register and select a new screen name and password:
<ol>
<li>Go to the Netscape Instant Messenger home page, <a href="http://aim.aol.com/aimnew/Aim/register.adp" target="alfie11">
 http://aim.aol.com/aimnew/Aim/register.adp.</a> The Instant Messenger web page appears on your screen, allowing you to register.</li>
<li>Type your screen name, password (twice for confirmation), and email address in the appropriate fields.</li>
<li>After you have completed the registration process, use your new screen name and password in the sign-on screen.</li>
</ol>

<p><br>[ <a href="#im_start">Return to beginning of section</a> ]

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_signon"></a>
<h2>Signing On to Netscape Instant Messenger</h2>

<p>Before you can use Instant Messenger to send a message or to chat, you need to start the program and sign on.

<p>To start and sign on to Netscape Instant Messenger:

<ol>
<li>Display the Netscape Instant Messenger Sign On screen to start the program. You can display the screen in three different ways: </li>

<ul>
<li>
Open the Tasks menu and choose Instant Messenger. Or: </li>
<li>
Click the Instant Messenger icon in the taskbar at the bottom of the Netscape 6 window. Or: </li>
<li>
Click the Buddy List tab in the Sidebar.</li>
</ul>

<li>Type your screen name in the Screen Name field.</li>
<li>Type your password in the Password field. If you want to save your password for your next session, select "Save password."</li>
<li>Click Sign On, or press Enter. </li>
</ol>

<p><i>Tip:</i> If you want Netscape Instant Messenger to start when you start Netscape 6, select "Sign on at launch" on the sign-on screen.

<p>[ <a href="#im_start">Return to beginning of section</a> ]

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_multnam"></a>
<h2>Using Multiple Screen Names</h2>

<p>If you have registered multiple screen names, you can sign on with the name of your choice. To sign on with a new screen name that you have registered: 

<ol>
<li>Display the Sign On screen.</li>
<li>Select the current screen name that is displayed in the Screen Name field, and type your new screen name over that.</li>
<li>Type the password for your new screen name in the Password field.</li>
<li>Click Sign On.</li>
</ol>


<p>[ <a href="#im_start">Return to beginning of section</a> ]


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_prefs"></a>
<h2>Setting Preferences</h2>

<p>You can set preferences for Instant Messenger to meet your particular needs. 

<p>If you have previously used AOL Instant Messenger, and you have installed Netscape 6 on your machine, you will have to select your preferences again. Preferences, unlike Buddy Lists, do not transfer automatically from AOL Instant Messenger to Netscape 6. 

<p>You can set preferences for such things as:
<ul>
<li>Displaying graphical smiles in messages</li>
<li>Indicating your online status in Mozilla Mail</li>
<li>Specifying who can contact you</li>
<li>Turning on sounds to play when a you receive a message or a buddy signs on</li>
<li>Editing your Away messages</li>
</ul>

<p>You set your preferences using the Instant Messenger Preferences panels. To access the panels:
<ul>
<li>Open the Edit menu, choose Preferences, and then select one of the Instant Messenger categories. You may need to click the widget (triangle) next to the words Instant Messenger to see all of the categories. Or:</li>
<li>Click the Preferences button in the toolbar of the standalone Instant Messenger window.</li>
</ul>

<p>[ <a href="#im_start">Return to beginning of section</a> ]


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_connect"></a>
<h2>Specifying Connection Settings</h2>

<p>If you access the Internet through an Internet Service Provider, you most likely will not need to make any changes to the Connection preferences panel. If you access the Internet through a local area network firewall (for example, at your workplace), then your network administrator may need to configure the proxy section of the Connection preferences panel.

<p>Here are descriptions of the items in the Connection panel:

<p><b>Server Host</b>

<p>This field contains the default Internet address of the Netscape Instant Messenger server. Under normal circumstances, you do not need to change this field. If your proxy server needs to resolve the host name, you may need to put the IP address instead of the name of the server in this field.

<p><b>Server Port</b>

<p>This field contains the default server port number to be used on the Netscape Instant Messenger server. Under normal circumstances, you do not need to change this field. 

<p><b>Connect using proxy</b>

<p>If you click this button, the Netscape Instant Messenger software activates the proxy server controls.

<p><b>Proxy Server Host</b>

<p>Supply the name of the proxy server.

<p><b>Proxy Server Port</b>

<p>Supply the port number to be used on the proxy server.

<p><b>Protocol</b>

<p>Specify whether your proxy server uses the SOCKS 4, SOCKS 5, or HTTPS protocol.

<p><b>Authentication Username</b>

<p>Supply the authentication username required by the proxy.

<p><b>Authentication Password</b>

<p>Supply the authentication password required by the proxy.

<a NAME="im_list"></a>
<h2>About the Buddy List</h2>

<p>When you sign on to Instant Messenger, your Buddy List appears. Three groups are automatically created for you in your Buddy List window: Buddies, Family, and Co-Workers. Add your buddies to any of these groups or create additional groups. 

<p>There are two tabs in your Buddy List: List Setup and Online.

<ul>
<li>List Setup lets you add buddies to the list and create groups for them. For example, you can create groups for specific interests such as Golf Pals, College Roommates, Neighbors, and so forth, then add your buddies to them. The List Setup tab also lets you delete buddies and groups.</li>

<p>In the List Setup tab:

<ul>
<li>Each group appears as a folder.</li>
<li>The buddies in each group appear as branches from the folder. You must expand the group to see buddies in that group. To expand the group, click the triangle next to the folder so that the triangle points downward. Or, select the name of the group and press Enter.</li>
<li>You cannot see which of your buddies is online when you display the List Setup tab. Click the Online tab to see which buddies are online.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li>Online shows you when your buddies are available.
Whenever your buddies sign on, you can see them in your Buddy List and
send them messages instantly.</li>

<p>In the Online tab:

<ul>
<li>Groups in the Buddy List window are initially shown expanded, displaying all your buddies in each group. You can switch the display mode between expanded and collapsed by clicking the small triangle to the left of each group name; or, select (highlight) the group name and press Enter.</li>
<li>Each group has a number in parentheses to the right of the group name to indicate how many people in the group are online out of the total number of buddies in the group. For example, (3/9) means that three of the nine buddies in the group are currently online.</li>
<li>Buddy names in bold indicate the buddies who signed on most recently. Buddy names in gray and italic indicate the buddies who just signed off. </li>
</ul>

</ul>


<p><i>Tip:</i> Buddy lists are stored on a server rather than on your computer. That means you can access your buddy lists from anywhere, whenever you sign on to the Netscape Instant Messenger service.


<p>[ <a href="#im_buddy">Return to beginning of section</a> ]


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_addbuddy"></a>
<h2>Adding and Finding Buddies</h2>

<p>If you know a friend's screen name, you can add him or her to your Buddy
List immediately.

<li>
In the Buddy List, click the List Setup tab.</li>
<li>
Click the Add Buddy icon. You see the Add Buddy dialog box.</li>

rather than johndoe@aol.com.</li>
<li>
Select the group to which you want to add the screen name.</li>
<li>
Click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don't know a friend's screen name, Instant Messenger can help you
locate your friend using his or her email address.

<ol>
<li>
>From the People menu, select Find A Buddy.</li>
<li>
Type your buddy's email address in the "Friend's email address" field and click Next. Netscape Instant Messenger displays all screen names for the email address you specified.</li>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_sidebar"></a>
<h2>Using the Sidebar Buddy List</h2>

<p>If you use the Sidebar feature of Netscape 6, then you may find it convenient
to include your buddy list in a Sidebar tab.

<p>If it is not already open, open the Sidebar by clicking on its handle.

<blockquote><img SRC="images/image6.gif"></blockquote>

<p><br>The Sidebar Buddy List may be closed, so that only its header is
showing. To open it, click the tab on which the words Buddy List appear.
<br>&nbsp;
<blockquote><img SRC="images/image7.gif"></blockquote>

<p>The Sidebar Buddy List lets you know when one of your buddies is
online and available for a chat, even if Netscape Instant Messenger is
not open.

<p>If your buddy is online, his or her name appears in your buddy
list. If your buddy is idle, his or her name is dimmed and a small clock
icon appears next to the name. <img SRC="images/image8.gif" height=22 width=18 align=TEXTTOP>

<p>To send an instant message:

<ol>
<li>
Double-click a buddy's name in the Sidebar Buddy List.</li>
<li>
Type your message and click Send.</li>
</ol>

<p><i>Tip:</i> On Windows and Linux systems, you can right-click a name and choose to send an instant message or a chat invitation. On Mac OS systems, use Control-click.

<p>To add or remove buddies, click the List Setup tab to 
<a href="#im_addbuddy">add buddies </a>or

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_buddystatus"></a>
<h2>Checking the Status of Buddies</h2>

<p>To find out which of your buddies is online, click the Online tab in the
Buddy List. If you also keep your Buddy List displayed in the Sidebar,
you can check there to see who's online.

<p>You cannot see which of your buddies is online when you have the List
Setup tab displayed. Click the Online tab.

<p>In the Online tab:

<ul>
<li>To expand and collapse a group, click the small triangle next to the name of the group.</li>
<li>To see how many people in a group are online, check the number in parentheses
next to the group name. For example, (4/7) means that four of the seven
buddies in the group are currently online</li>
<li>Names displayed in gray are idle (idle means that a person hasn't used the computer for 15 minutes but is still online). The clock icon also appears next to a name of a buddy who is idle. <img SRC="images/image8.gif" height=22 width=18 align=CENTER></li>
</ul>

<p>In Mozilla Mail:

<p>You can also find out which of your buddies is online from within Netscape Mail. If a buddy is online, a presence icon appears next to his or her name in a message window, in the To, From, or CC fields. This icon also appears next the names of non-buddies. Non-buddies are Instant Messenger users who you have not added to your buddy list. For both buddies and non-buddies, the presence icon will show only for those users who have registered and confirmed their registration. 

<p>The presence icon next to a buddy's name disappears when he or she logs on or off. The presence icon does not change next to a non-buddy's name.

<h1>Away Messages</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you need to step away from your computer but do not want to sign off, you can use an Away message to let others know that you are temporarily unavailable.

<p>For planned absences, you can turn on your Away message to let others know when you will be back. Netscape Instant Messenger displays this message when anyone requests information about you and automatically replies with your Away message to anyone who sends you a message while you are away.

<h1>Warnings</h1>

<p>If someone else using the Netscape Instant Messenger service sends you annoying or offensive messages, you have two ways to respond.  You can issue a warning to the person or you can block the person.

<table CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=4 WIDTH="324" BGCOLOR="#CCCCCC" >
<tr>
<td class="inthissection">
<p>In this section:
<p><a href="#im_warnuser">Warning a User</a>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_warnuser"></a>
<h2>Warning a User</h2>

<p>To warn a user who has sent you an offensive message, click Warn in the Instant Message window in which you received the message.

<p>Warn imposes a warning on the sender, hampering that person's ability to send and receive messages. With frequent warnings, the user will not be able to exchange any messages with anyone. Only after a &ldquo;cooling off&rdquo; period can that user send and receive messages again.

<p>When you click Warn, you can choose to impose the warning anonymously. Anonymous warnings are less severe and the user you are warning won't know who issued the warning.

<p>Regarding warnings you send and receive:
<ul>
<li>You can issue only one warning for each message someone sends you.</li>
<li>If a user warns you, consider ending the conversation. Every additional message you send enables that user to warn you again.</li>
</ul>

<p>[ <a href="#im_warnings">Return to beginning of section</a> ]


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="im_warnview"></a>
<h2>Viewing Someone's Warning Level</h2>

<p>You can see someone's warning level next to the person's screen name in your Buddy List window.

<p>Alternatively, you can permanently block one or more people from sending you messages. See <a href="#im_blockuser">"Blocking a User"</a> for more information.
