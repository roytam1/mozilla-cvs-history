<h2>Creating a New Page</h2>

<p>Netscape Composer is an HTML (HyperText Markup Language) editor that allows you to create and edit web pages.  
Composer is <i>WYSIWYG</i> (What You See Is What You Get) editor, so you can see how your page will look to the reader as you're creating it.  It's not necessary for you to know HTML, since most of the basic HTML functions are available as commands from the toolbars and menus.

<p>To create a web page, use one of the methods described below. Once you've
started a page, you can add and edit text just as you would in a word processor.</p>

<p><b>To create a new page</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Open the Tasks menu and choose Composer. A Composer window containing a blank page opens.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>To edit a page you're currently browsing in Navigator</b>:</p>

<ul>
<li>In the Navigator window of the page you're viewing, open the File menu and choose Edit Page. 
You see a Composer window that contains the page you're viewing.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>To start from an HTML file stored on your local drive</b>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Tasks menu and choose Composer.</li>
<li>Open the File menu and choose Open File.</li>
<li>Locate the file on your hard drive that you want to use.</li>
<li>Click Open to see the specified file in a Composer window.</li>
</ol>

<p><b>To edit a Web page</b>:
<ol>
<li>Open the file menu and choose Open Web Location.
<li>In the Open Web Location dialog box, type the URL of the page (for example,<i> www.netscape.com</i>), and then select New Composer from the pop-up menu.
<li>Click Open to view the page in a Composer window. 
<b>Note</b>: Keep in mind that when you save this page, it will only be saved on your hard drive.
</ol>

<p><b>Tip</b>: In the Composer window you can quickly open the most recent files you've been working on by opening the File menu, choosing Recent Pages, and then selecting the file you want from the list.

<p>
[&nbsp;<A HREF="#comp_start">Return to beginning of section</A>&nbsp;]
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="Edit_modes"</a>
<h2>Choosing the Right Editing Mode</h2>

<p>Composer allows you to quickly switch between four <i>editing modes</i> or views. Each editing mode allows you to continue working in your page, but displays varying levels of HTML tags (and tag icons).

<p>Before you choose an editing mode:

<ul>
<li>Open the View menu and make sure there's a check mark next to Edit Mode Toolbar.
</ul>

<p>The Edit Mode toolbar has four tabs:

<ul>
<li><b>Normal</b>: Choose this mode to show table borders and named anchor icons. All other  HTML tag icons are hidden. 
<li><b>Show All Tags</b>: Choose this mode to show table borders and all HTML tag icons.
<li><b>HTML Source</b>: Choose this mode to see the page as unformatted HTML code.
<li><b>Edit Preview</b>: Choose this mode to see the page as it would appear in a browser window. </li>
</ul>

<p><b>Note</b>: JavaScript functions, frames, and animated gif files are not enabled in any of the editing modes.</p>

<p>
[&nbsp;<A HREF="#comp_start">Return to beginning of section</A>&nbsp;]
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="browse_new_page"></a>
<h2>Saving and Browsing Your New Page</h2>

<p>To save a new page as an HTML file on your local drive:

<ul>
<li>Open the File menu and choose Save. If you haven't already given your page a title, Composer prompts you to do so.
 You see a dialog box where you can specify a filename or location. You don't need to add the .html extension to the filename; Composer adds it for you.

<li>Choose Save As if you want to give the page a different filename or location.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p><b>Tip</b>: Choose Revert to Last Saved from the File menu to retrieve the most recently saved copy of the document in which you're working. Keep in mind that your current changes will be lost.

<p>To view your page in a Navigator (browser) window in order to test your links:

<ul>
<li>Open the File menu and choose Browse Page. 
If you have not yet saved your document, Composer prompts you to enter a page title, filename, and location.
The Composer window remains open behind the new Navigator window. </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="PROPERTIES_PARAGRAPH"></a>
<h2>Formatting Paragraphs, Headings, and Lists</h2>

<p>To apply a format to a paragraph:

<ol>
<li>Place the pointer where you want the format to begin and click, or highlight the paragraph(s) you want to format. 
<li>Open the Format menu and choose Paragraph.
<li> Select one of the following formats:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Body Text</b>: Applies the application default font and style for regular text, without affecting the spacing before or after the text.
	<li><b>Paragraph</b>: Inserts a paragraph tag (use this to begin a new paragraph). The paragraph format applies to the spacing before and after the paragraph.
	<li><b>Address</b>: This format can be used for a web page "signature" that indicates the author of the page and the person to contact for more information, as in this example: <address>Carlos_Goldstein@netscape.com</address>
You might want to include the date and copyright notice. This format usually 
appears at the bottom of the web page under a horizontal line. Composer displays address format in italics.</li>
	<li><b>Preformatted</b>: This is useful for elements such as code examples, 
column data, and mail messages that you want displayed in a fixed-width font. 
Most browsers remove extra 	spaces, tabs, and paragraph returns in your text. 
However, text that uses the Preformatted style is displayed with the white 
space intact, preserving the layout of the original text.</li>
	<li><b>Blockquote</b>: Choose this format to indent quoted text on both the left and right.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p>To apply a heading format:

<ol>
<li>Place the pointer where you want the format to begin and click, or highlight the text you want to format.
<li>Open the Format menu and choose Paragraph.
<li>Choose the level of heading you want, from 1 to 6 (largest to smallest). For example, choose "Heading 1" for your main heading, "Heading 2" for the next level, and so forth.</li>
</ol>

<p>To apply a list item format:

<ol>
<li>Highlight the text you want to format. 
<li>Open the Format menu and choose List.
<li>Choose the list style:
	<ul>
	<li><b>Bulleted</b>: Each Item has a bullet (dot) next to it (as in this list).
	<li><b>Numbered</b>: Items are numbered.
	<li><b>Term</b> and <b>Definition</b>: These two styles work together, creating two columns such as for a glossary.
	Use the Term tag for the word being defined, and the Definition style for the definition.
	The Term text appears flush left, and the Definition text appears indented.
	</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p><b>Tip</b>: You can quickly apply a list style to text by selecting the text and clicking the Numbered List <img src="images/numbers.gif" width=16 height=16 alt="" border="0"> and Bulleted List <img src="images/bullets.gif" width=16 height=16 alt="" border="0"> buttons on the toolbar.

<p>To change the style of bullets or numbers:

<ol>
<li>Click to place the pointer within the text of the list item you want to change.
If you want to change the entire list, select the whole list.
<li>Open the Format menu and choose List Properties.
<li>Choose a bullet or number style from the pop-up menu. For numbered lists, also specify a starting number.
If it is a bulleted list, you can change the bullet style.
</ol>

<p>To align a paragraph or text in your page, for example, centering or aligning to the left or right:

<ol>
<li>Place the pointer in the paragraph or line of text you want to align.
<li>Open the Format menu and choose Align; then choose an alignment option.
Or choose the alignment option from the formatting toolbar.
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="PROPERTIES_CHARACTER"></a>
<h2>Changing Text Color, Style, and Font</h2>

<p>To change the style, color, or font of selected text:

<ol>
<li>Highlight the text you want to format.</li>
<li>Open the Format menu and choose one of the following: </li>
	<ul>
	<li><b>Font</b>: Use this to choose a font. If you prefer to use 
	fonts specified by the reader's browser, select Variable Width or Fixed Width.
	<b>Note</b>: Not all fonts installed on your computer appear. 
	Instead of specifying a font that may not be available to all who view your web page,
	it's generally best to select one of the fonts provided in the menu because those fonts work on every computer</li>
	<li><b>Size</b>: Use this to choose a <i>relative</i> font size or select an option to 
increase or decrease text size (relative to the surrounding text). 
	<li><b>Text Style</b>: Use this to select a style, such as italic, bold, or underline, or apply an object identifier, for example, Code.
	<li><b>Text Color</b>: Use this to choose a color from the color picker. If you are familiar with HTML color codes, you can type a specific code.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>

<p>You can also change the background color of the page, or use an image as a background. See <a href="#DOCUMENT_PROPERTIES_APPEARANCE">Setting Page Colors and Backgrounds</a>.

<p><b>Tip:</b> To quickly remove all formats from selected text, open the Format menu and choose Discontinue Text Styles.

	and lowercase text. For exact matches, leave this option unchecked.
	<li><b>Wrap around</b>: Use this to search to the end of the page and then start again 
	from the top.
	<li><b>Search backwards</b>: Use this to search from the end to the beginning of the page.
	</ul>
<li>Click Find to begin searching. When Composer locates the first occurrence of the text, choose Find Again from the Edit menu to search for the next occurrence.
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="addtable"></a>
<h2>Adding and Deleting Rows, Columns, and Cells</h2>

<p>Composer allows you to quickly add or delete one or more cells to your table. 
In addition, you can set options that allow you to maintain the original rectangular structure or layout of the table while you perform editing tasks.

<p>To add a cell or group of cells (rows and columns) to your table:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click inside the table where you want to add a cell (or cells).</li>
<li>Open the Table menu and then choose Insert. 
<li>Choose one of the cell groupings. You can also insert a new table within a table cell.</li>
</ol>

<p>To delete a cell or group of cells:</p>

<ol>
<li>Click a row, column, or cell.</li>
<li>Open the Table menu and choose Delete.
<li>Choose the item you want to delete.</li>
</ol>

<p>To join (or merge) a cell with the cell on its right:

<ul>
<li>Click inside the cell, open the table menu, and choose Join with Cell to the Right.
</ul>

<p>To split a joined cell back into two cells:

<ul>
<li>Click inside the cell, open the Table menu, and then choose Split Cell.
</ul>

<h3>Correcting the Table Layout</h3>

<p>Generally, when you delete one or more cells, Composer removes the cell border as well. This can result in a table with empty spaces, or whose outline appears irregular due to an uneven number of cells. You may want to delete one or more cells but still maintain the table's original rectangular layout, or structure. 

<p>Composer allows you to set a preference for preserving the table's structure by adding cells at the end of a row, wherever needed:

<ul>
<li>Open the Edit menu, choose Preferences and then choose Composer. 
Set the preferences you want in the Table Editing section. 
You can choose to allow the Delete key to remove an entire cell or just remove the cell's contents.

</ul>

<ol>
<li>Double-click the image, or select it and click the Image button <img src="images/image.gif" width=16 height=16 alt="" border="0"> on the toolbar. 
You see the Image Properties dialog box; click More Properties to expand the list of settings. To collapse the list of properties, click Fewer Properties. 
	<ul>
	<li><b>Image URL</b>: Type the filename and location of the image file. Click 
	Choose File to search for an image file on your hard drive or network.
	<li><b>Alternate Text</b>: Enter text that will display in place of the 
	original image; for example, a caption or a brief description of the 
	image. It's a good practice to specify 	alternate text for readers who 
	use text-only web browsers or who have graphics turned off. Otherwise, 
	your readers might see placeholder images.
	<li><b>Dimensions</b>: Click Custom Size, then specify the new height and width, in pixels. 
	This setting doesn't affect the original image file, just the image inserted in your page.
	Click Original Size 
	to undo any changes you've 	made to the dimensions.  
	<li><b>Constrain</b>: If you change the image size, it's a good idea to check 
	this in order to maintain the image's aspect ratio (so that it doesn't 
	appear distorted).
	<li><b>Align Text to Image</b>: If you've placed your image next to any text, 
	select an alignment icon to indicate how you want text positioned relative 
	to the image. <b>Tip</b>: To see the effects of alignment changes you've made, 
	it's a good idea to view your page in a browser window.
	<li><b>Spacing</b>: Specify the amount of space surrounding the image; between the image and adjoining test. 
	You can also put a solid black border around the image and specify 
	its width in pixels. Specify zero for no border.
	</ul>
<li>To create hotspots in your image that contain hyperlinks, click Edit Image Map to use Composer's <a href="#IMAGE_MAP_EDITOR">Image Map Editor</a>.
<li><b>Note</b>: To apply additional attributes or JavaScript events, click Advanced Edit to display the <a href="#PROPERTY_EDITOR">Advanced Property Editor</a>.

<li>Click OK to confirm your changes.
</ol>

<h2>Creating Image Maps (Hotspots) for Your Images</h2>

<p>Using Composer's Image Map Editor you can create a <i>hotspots</i> to map areas of an image.
A map file indicates the image's hotspots--coordinates of the various areas of the image that you can assign to URLs.

<p>The Image Map Editor works like a drawing tool--the selected image is displayed in a window area, with shape tool buttons located on the toolbar at the left side of the window. 

<p>To use the Image Map Editor:

<ol>
<li>Select the image in your page.
<li>Click the Image button <img src="images/image.gif" width=16 height=16 alt="" border="0"> in the toolbar to display the Image Properties dialog box, then click the Edit button in the Image Map section. (If necessary, first click More Properties to expand the dialog box.)
<li>Use the shape tools to select portions of the image that you can then designate as hotspots that contain URLs or named anchors. First click the tool button, then click and drag inside the image to define the selection.
	<ul>
	<li>Rectangle: Use this tool to  define a rectangular selection.
	<li>Circle: Use this tool to define a circular or oval selection.
	<li>Polygon: Use this tool to define a geometric selection.
	</ul>
Once you've defined an area, you see the Hotspot Properties dialog box, where you can enter either a URL or the name of an anchor (target) as the destination (jump-to location) of the link.
<li>When you've finished designating hotspots, click OK, and then click OK again to confirm your changes.
<li>To test the links in your image, save the page, and then click Browse to see the page in the Navigator browser.
</ol>

<p>To remove the image map from an image:
<ol>
<li>Select the image you want.
<li>Open the Image Properties dialog box, and then click Remove Image Map. (If necessary, first click More Properties to expand the dialog box.)
<li>Click OK to confirm your changes.
</ol>

<h2>Creating Links Within the Same Page</h2>

<p>To create a link within the same page, for example a link that the reader can use to jump from one section to another, you must create an <i>anchor</i>, and then create a link that points to the anchor. Anchors are also called <i>named anchors</i> or <i>targets</i>.

<ol>
<li>Place the pointer at the beginning of a line where you want to create an anchor, or select some text.</li>
<li>Click the Anchor button <img src="images/anchor.gif" width=16 height=16 alt="" border="0"> on the toolbar, or open the Insert menu and choose Named Anchor.</li>
<li>Type a name for the anchor in the dialog box (up to 30 characters).  Don't include spaces. If you need to, use an underscore "_" to separate words. <br>If you selected some text in step #1, this box already contains a name.</li>
<li>Click  OK. <br>An anchor icon appears in your document to mark the anchor's location: <img src="images/anchor-in-doc.gif" width=12 height=12 alt="" border="0"></li>
</ol>


<p>
To create the link that the reader can click to jump to the anchor:

	<li><b>Select a Heading</b>: Use if you're creating a link to a level heading 
(for example, Heading 1 - Heading 6), select from a list of headings currently available in the page.
</ul>
<li>Click OK.
<li>To test the link you just created, open the File menu and choose Browse Page, then click the link.</li>

<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences; then click the Composer category.
</ol>

<p>You can set these defaults:

<ul>

<li><b>Maximum number of pages listed</b>: Specify the number of pages that appear under Recent Pages in the File menu.

<li><b>Maintain source formatting</b>: Select this if you don't want Composer to remove white space (extra lines, tabs, etc.) that makes the HTML code more readable. This preference does not affect how your pages appear in a browser window.

<li><b>Maintain table layout when inserting or deleting cells</b>: When you delete one or more cells, Composer removes the cell border as well, which can result in a table with empty spaces, or an outline that appears irregular due to an uneven number of cells. Check this if you want Composer to always preserve the table's layout (that is, keep it in a rectangular 	shape) by adding cells where needed.

<li><b>Delete key</b>: Choose the action you want the Delete key to take on selected cells in tables.
