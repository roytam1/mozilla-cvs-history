<h2>Using the Mail Account Setup Wizard</h2>
<a name="NEWSGROUP"></a>
<p>If you have just installed Netscape Mail or have yet to set your preferences for sending and receiving mail and newsgroup messages, you will be asked to use the Account Wizard when you first launch Mail.
<p>The Wizard asks you to provide required information, such as your user name and email address. If you do not know a setting, you must exit the Wizard and consult your Internet service provider (ISP) or help desk.

<a NAME="additional_accounts"></a>
<p>You can add additional mail and newsgroup accounts from the File menu of the Mail window by choosing New, then Account. (Or, you can open the Edit menu of the Mail window, choose Mail/News Account Settings, and then click the New Account button.) Be sure to type the account information exactly as it's given to you. Click Next or Back to move through the panels. To cancel your account creation, click Cancel.
<p>To set up a mail account with an ISP or email provider, you'll need to provide:
<ul>
<li>your user name</li>
<li>your email address</li>
<li>the incoming and outgoing mail server names</li>
<li>the incoming server type (<a href="#IMAP_and_POP3"> IMAP or POP3</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>To set up a newsgroup account, you'll need to provide:
<ul>
	<li>your email address</li>
	<li>newsgroup server name</li>
</ul>
<p>To set up an AOL or Netscape WebMail account, you only need to provide your email address.
<p>To set up a new mail or newsgroup account:
<p>Begin from the Netscape browser window.
<ol>
<li>Open the Task menu and then choose Mail. You see the Mail window.</li>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Mail/News Account Settings.</li>
<li>Click the New Account button to activate the New Account wizard.</li>
<li>Choose the type of account you want to set up, and click Next. The information the wizard asks you to provide depends on the type of account you are setting up. The rest of the steps in this section assume you are setting up an account with an ISP or email provider.</li>
<li>
In the Identity section, enter your name (as you would like it to appear in the "From"
field of messages you send) and email address, and click Next.</li>

<li>
In the Server Information section, select the type of incoming mail server (<a href="#IMAP_and_POP3"> IMAP or POP3</a>). Enter the incoming server name and the outgoing (SMTP) server name (this is the name of the mail server that sends your messages, and is also known as your
SMTP host). Then click Next.</li>
<p><b>Note</b>: The name of your SMTP host may not have been reported
to you in your ISP information or by your system administrator. Your SMTP
host may be the same as your POP3 or IMAP host. If in doubt, contact your ISP or system administrator.
<p>
<li>
In the User Name section, enter your user name and click Next.</li>

<li>
In the Account Name section, assign a name for this account (for
example, "Work" or "Family"), and click Next.</li>

<li>Click Finish to set up your account.</li>

</ol>
<p>

<a NAME="account_settings"></a>

<h2>Setting Up Additional Mail and News Accounts</h2>
<p>The very first time you launch Mail, you are asked to use the Account
Wizard if you have not already set up an account. You can <a href="#additional_accounts">add additional mail and newsgroup accounts</a> from the File menu of the Mail window by choosing New, then Account. (Or, you can also open the Edit menu of the Mail window, choose Mail/News Account Settings, and then click the New Account button.)
<p>You can also use the Account Settings dialog box to change or add
information for an existing account, including:
<ul>
<li>mail and newsgroup server settings (for example, message deletion and download preferences)</li>

<li>storage settings for message copies and folders</li>

<li>your reply-to address, organization name, and signature</li>
</ul>

<p>To use the Account Settings dialog box:
<p>Begin from the Mail window.
<ol>
<li>
Open the Edit menu and choose Mail/News Account Settings.
You see the Account Settings dialog box.</li>
<ul>
<li>To set up a new mail or news account using the  Account  Wizard, click
the New Account button.</li>

<li>
To specify an account as your default, highlight it and then click the
Set as Default  button.</li>
<li>
To remove an account and its settings, click the Delete button.</li>

<li>
To modify information for the outgoing mail server, click the Outgoing (SMTP)
Server item.</li>
</ul>
<li>
Click OK to save your changes.</li>
</ol>
<p>To view or change information for an existing mail or newsgroup account:
<ol>
<li>Click the account name in the left-hand side of the Account Settings dialog box. You see information about the account, such as your email address and signature file.</li>

<li>
Click the Server category (beneath the Account name). You see the Server Settings
section, where you can edit mail or newsgroup server settings. <p><b>Note</b>: If you need to change server type, server name, or user name, you must delete the existing account and recreate it with the new settings.<p>
</li>

<li>
Click the Copies and Folders category. You see the
Copy and Folder Settings section, where you can specify whether to
send automatic (blind carbon copies) messages and where you want to store messages.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="PREFERENCES_MAILNEWS_IDENTITY"></a>
<h2>Viewing or Changing Your Identity Preferences</h2>

<p>To view or change your identity preferences, such as your user name, reply-to address, and signature file:
<p>Begin from the Mail window.<p>
<ol>
<li>
Open the Edit menu and choose Mail/News Account Settings.
<li>Select the account name you want to change.</li>

<li>

<li>
Select "Attach this signature" and then choose the name of the signature
file you want to attach to your messages. Click Choose to locate the signature
file.</li>
<li>
Select "Compose messages using HTML" if you prefer to create formatted text for mail and newsgroup messages using the HTML editor. Leave this item unchecked to use the plain text editor.</li>

<p><b>Tip:</b> If you select this option, but you later want to compose a message or reply to a message using the plain text editor, hold down the Shift key and click New Msg or Reply. Shift-clicking the New Msg button or the Reply button opens the plain text editor instead of the HTML editor.</p>

<a NAME="IMAP_and_POP3"></a>

<h2>Choosing Between IMAP and POP3 Mail Servers</h2>

<p>Netscape Mail can work with two types of mail servers: IMAP and POP3. If your
Internet service provider supports both, these descriptions may help you
choose which one to use:
<p><b>Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP)</b>
<p><b>Advantages</b>: Your messages and any changes to them stay on your
server, saving local disk space. Also, you always have access to an updated
mailbox, and you can get your mail from multiple locations. Performance
on a modem is faster, since you initially download message headers only.
<p><b>Disadvantages:</b> Not all ISPs support IMAP.
<p><b>Post Office Protocol (POP3)</b>
<p><b>Advantages</b>: Your messages are downloaded to your local computer
all at once, but you can also specify whether to keep copies of the messages on the server. Most ISPs currently support
POP3.
<p><b>Disadvantages</b>: You must synchronize your local Inbox with your
server's mailbox. This can result in downloading new messages over and
over each time you connect. If you use more than one computer, messages
might reside on one or the other, but not both. POP3 doesn't work as well
as IMAP over a slow link connection. Also, you can't access all mail folders
from multiple locations.

<li>
Select the setting "Check for new messages every  ___" and then specify
the number of minutes between mail checks. If you do not select this setting,
Mail will only check for new messages when you click Get Msg or the Mail icon on the
task bar.</li>

<li>
Select "Automatically download any new messages" if you want Mail to immediately retrieve messages each time it checks the server.</li>

<li>
Select "Leave messages on server" to store messages on the server.</li>

<li>Select "Delete messages on server when they are deleted locally" to remove messages from the server once you delete them from your computer.</li>

<li>Select "Limit message download to ___" to conserve disk space and download time by setting a size limit for incoming messages. Messages that are over the size limit you specify are displayed in truncated form; simply click on the indicated link to download the remainder.
<li>
Select "Empty Trash on Exit" to empty the Trash folder whenever you quit
Mail.</li>

<li><b>Cc</b>: For secondary recipients (carbon copy).</li>

<li><b>Bcc</b>: For secondary recipients not identified to the other recipients, including those in the cc list (blind carbon copy).</li>

<li><b>Reply-To</b>: For recipients to reply to a different email address than the one the message is sent from.</li>

<p>
<b>Tip</b>: You can quickly address a message by right-clicking the email address
contained in a message you're reading, and then selecting Send Mail To
from the pop-up menu. </p>

<a NAME="SENTFROM"></a>
<p><b>Changing the Account From Which a Message is Sent</b>
<p>
If you have multiple mail accounts, the account listed in the From field
is based on the account (or server) you have currently selected when you
choose to create a new message. However, Netscape Mail also allows you
to change the account a message is sent from while you're composing a message.
Click the From field to view a list of your accounts and then select the
account you want. A copy of the message is saved in your Local Sent folder.

<p><b>Note</b>: If you choose an account to which you are not currently
logged onto, Netscape Mail asks you to log in to the account.
<a NAME="pinpoint"></a>
<p><b>About Address Autocompletion</b>
<p>Address autocompletion allows you to easily address mail
from the message composition window without having to search for names
or type complete names. Mail automatically checks your address books and completes the name if it finds a unique match. It also prevents mistakes by showing all possible choices with additional information if it finds multiple matches. Address autocompletion is enabled by default.
<p>
If you don't want to use an address that Mail provides, simply press Backspace or Delete to erase the address and then enter an alternate address.

<p>To disable address autocompletion:
<p>Begin from the Mail window.</p>
<ol>
<li>
Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
<li>Under the Mail and Newsgroups category, click Address Books.
<li>In the Addressing Messages section, remove the check next to Enable address autocompletion.
<li>Click OK.
</ol>

<a NAME="SENDING_OPTIONS"></a>

<h2>Selecting Message Sending Options</h2>
<p>While you're composing a message, you can select these additional message
sending options from the Options menu:

<p><b>Select Addresses</b>

<p>The Select Addresses option lets you choose the recipient's email address from your Address
Books. Select an address and then click To:, Cc:, or Bcc: to address your message.

<p><b>Check Spelling</b>

<p>Checks the spelling of the message text. You can also click Spell.

<p><b>Rewrap</b>

<p>If you are composing a message using the plain text editor, you can use the Rewrap command to rewrap long lines of quoted text to fit the composition window. This command rewraps selected quoted text to the window width, or rewraps all quoted text if no text is selected. This command is primarily useful when you are replying to a message where the original message is quoted in your reply, and the original message contains long lines.

<p>You use the Mail/News Account Settings command on the Edit menu to specify that you want to use the plain text editor for composing messages. In the Account Settings dialog box, select the account, and uncheck "Compose messages using HTML" to use the plain text editor for all messages. If you only want to use the plain text editor occasionally, you can hold down the Shift key while clicking the Get Msg or the Reply button to use the plain text editor on an as-needed basis.

<p><b>Format</b>

<p>Send the message as plain text, or HTML (formatted), or both. If you
choose "Auto-Detect," Mail asks you for the format to use if it's unknown
whether the recipient's mail program can display an HTML message. The format you choose here overrides the send format you specified using the Preferences command on the Edit menu.

<p><b>Priority</b>

<p>Choose a label or "flag" that indicates whether the message has lowest,
low, normal, high, or highest priority.

<p><b>File Sent Message</b>

<p>Choose this if you want to file an additional copy of the sent message
in a different folder than your default Sent folder. Then select the folder
you want.

<h2>Using HTML in Your Messages</h2>

<p>Netscape Mail allows you to compose mail and newsgroup messages using either
the HTML (rich-text) formatting editor or the plain-text editor for each mail account you have. In addition, you can choose whether your addressees should receive HTML or plain-text messages by default, and how Mail should handle messages when it's not
known if the addressee(s) can receive HTML formatted mail.

<p>To specify whether to use the HTML editor as the default for composing
messages:
<ol>
<li>
Choose the mail or newsgroup account you want to use.</li>

<li>
Open the Edit menu and choose Mail/News Account Settings.</li>

<li>
Select "Compose messages using HTML." You see the HTML formatting toolbar in the message composition window. Leave this box unchecked to use the
plain-text editor for this account.</li>

</li>

<li>
Select the option you want and then click OK.</li>
</ol>

<p>If while composing a message you realize that one or more recipients
may not be able to receive HTML-formatted mail, you can easily convert
the message to a different format when you click Send:
<p>
<ol>
<li>In the message composition window, open the Options menu and choose Format.
<li>Select the format you want to use for sending the message:

<h2>About Netscape Mail Address Books</h2>
<p>
Netscape Mail provides you with two address books: the Personal Address
Book, and the Collected Addresses Book. You can create additional ones as well.
<h4>
Personal Address Book</h4>
<p>
Use the Personal Address Book to add specific names you want, or to import
address books from other email programs and previous versions of Netscape.
You can create mailing lists, edit individual address entries, and create
additional address books. If you have a Netcenter account, you can synchronize entries with those in your Netcenter WebMail Address Book.
<h4>
Collected Addresses</h4>
<p>
The Collected Addresses address book collects the email addresses contained
in incoming and outgoing messages.  For incoming email messages, Mail stores the addresses in each message as soon as you open it. Addresses from outgoing messages are stored as soon as you click Send.

<p>To enable automatic address collection:
<ol start="1">
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.</li>
<li>Under the Mail and Newsgroups category, click Address Books.</li>
<li>Select Enable Email Address Collection to start collecting addresses.</li>
<li>Choose whether you want to use this feature for incoming or outgoing messages, or both.</li>
<li>Choose whether you want to limit the size of the collected address book. The default size is 700 cards. If you add a new card that exceeds the limit, the oldest card is removed and the new card is added, keeping the total number of cards the same.</li>
<li>Click Ok.</li>
</ol>
<p>
<h4>Changing the Address Book Window Display</h4>

another email program, you can add its entries to your personal address
book. When you import another address book and add it to your own, Mail
does not overwrite entries in your address book, but adds the new entries.
<p>You can also import address books and mail messages from Eudora, Outlook, and
Outlook Express. You can import the following types of address book
file formats: tab or comma separated text or .ldif.
<p>To import messages or address book files:
<ol>
<li>From the File menu, choose Import.</li>

<li>
Follow the instructions to import mail folders and address
book files.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Syncing Entries with Your Netscape WebMail Address Book</h2>

<p>If you have a Netcenter account, you can save time managing email from that account  by <i>synchronizing</i> or matching entries in your Netscape WebMail Address Book with those in your Netscape Personal Address Book. Whenever you add, edit, or delete an entry in one address book, the other address book is updated so that entries in both address books match.
<p>To perform an address book sync:
<ol>
	<li>In the Address Book window, click the Sync button on the toolbar or choose Sync Netscape Address Book from the File menu.
	<li>If you have not already logged in to your Netcenter account, Mail prompts you for your Netcenter user name and password.
	<li>Click OK to begin synchronization.  
	</ol>
<p>You can continue to synchronize address books throughout your Mail session (without having to log in again). Just click Sync or choose Sync Netscape Address Book from the File menu.

<p><b>Note</b>: If you have a Netcenter account, but the Sync button is dimmed, Netscape has not yet updated your existing account to take advantage of the Sync feature. Netscape notifies you (via an email message) when your Netcenter account has been updated. If you do not yet have a Netcenter account, you can sign up for one by going to <i>http://www.netscape.com</i>.

<a NAME="PREFERENCES_MAILNEWS_FORMATTING"></a>
<h2>Setting Preferences for HTML Messages</h2>

<p>If you regularly compose HTML email messages, keep in mind that sometimes not all recipients use email programs that display HTML formatting properly.  Netscape Mail lets you specify how you want to handle messages that go to those recipients: converted to plain text, as HTML, or as both HTML and plain text.  
<p>Whenever you add a person or address card to your address book, you can specify whether that addressee can receive HTML-formatted messages. However, when this information is unknown, you can set preferences for how Mail handles these messages:
<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.</li>
<li>Under the Mail and Newsgroups category, click Send Format.</li>
<li>Choose one of the following options:
<ul>
<li>
Ask me what to do (Mail prompts you to choose a format before you send the message)</li>
<li>
Convert the message to plain text (may lose formatting such as bold text)</li>
<li>Send the message in HTML anyway (some email programs may have trouble displaying the message)</li>
<li>
Send the message in both plain text and HTML (this uses more disk space)</li>
</ul>
You can always override these settings for an individual message through the
Options menu of the message composition window.

<li>
Click OK.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Note</b>: These preferences apply to email messages only, not to newsgroup messages.</p>

<a NAME="PREFERENCES_MAILNEWS_ADDRESSING"></a>
<h2>Setting Preferences for Address Books</h2>
<p>
To set preferences for Netscape Mail's address books (for example, email address collection):
<p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
<li>Under the Mail and Newsgroups category, select Address Books.
</ol>
<p><b>Email Address Collection</b>
<p>In addition to your Personal Address Book, Netscape Mail provides you with a Collected Addresses Book that can automatically store email addresses from your incoming or outgoing messages, or both. For  incoming email messages, Mail stores the addresses in each message as soon as you open it. Addresses from outgoing messages are stored as soon as you click Send.
<p>
Check the box to enable automatic address collection, and choose whether you want to use this feature for incoming or outgoing messages, or both.

<p><b>Addressing Messages</b>
<p>Address autocompletion allows you to quickly address mail without having to search for names or type names completely. Simply type a few characters, and  Mail automatically checks your address books and completes the name if it finds a unique match. If multiple matches are found, Mail shows you a list of all possible choices. Check the box to enable address autocompletion.
