<hr><h1>Managing Profiles</h1>

<p>If you use the Internet at home and at work, you may want to have access to a different set of bookmarks, preferences, address books, email accounts, My Sidebar setup, and so on. Similarly, family members may want to share share a copy of the same browser software but keep their Internet identities separate. 

<p>The Profile Manager lets you create different profiles, each with its own booksmarks, preferences, email settings, and so on. You automatically create a default profile when you first install your browser software. When you create one or more additional profiles, you will be asked which you want to use each time you launch the browser.</P>

		<li>On Mac OS, open the Netscape folder and then double-click the Profile Manager.
		<li>On Linux, type the following at the command line: <tt> ./netscape -profilemanager</tt>
	</ul>
	<li>Click Create Profile, read the Profile description, and then click Next.
	<li>Enter a profile name. This can be anything you like, such as your real name or a name that's related to what you use the profile for, such as &quot;School.&quot;
