<h2>What Information Does My Browser Give to a Web Site?</h2>

<p>When your browser displays a web page&mdash;for example, each time you click a link or type a URL&mdash;a small amount of information is given to the site. This information includes your operating environment, your Internet address (<i>not</i> your email address), and the page you're coming from.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Operating Environment</h3>

<p>The site is told something about your operating environment, such as
your browser type and operating system. This helps the site present the page 
in the best way for your screen. For example, the site might learn that you 
use the French version of Netscape 6.2.3 on a Windows 2000 computer.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="ip"></a>
<h3>Internet Address</h3>

<p>Your browser must tell the site your Internet address (also known as the Internet Protocol, or IP address) so the site knows where to send the page you are requesting. The site can't present the page you want to see unless it knows your IP address.

<p>Your IP address can be either temporary or fixed (static).

<p>If you connect to the Internet through a standard modem that's attached to your phone line, then your Internet service provider (ISP) assigns you a temporary IP address each time you log on. You use the temporary IP address for the duration of your Internet session. Each ISP has many IP addresses, and they assign the addresses at random to users. A web site can tell which ISP a temporary IP address comes from, but little else.

<p><b>Important:</b> Your IP address is <b>not</b> your email address. Your email address provides personally identifiable information about you much more readily than a temporary IP address can.

<p>If you have DSL, a cable modem, or a fiber-optic connection, you may have a fixed IP address that you use every time you connect.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Referring Page</h3>

<p>The site is also told which page you were reading when you clicked a 
link to see one of the site's pages. This allows the site to know which 
site referred you. Or, as you traverse the site, it allows the site to know 
which of its pages you came from.

<h2>What Are Cookies, and How Do They Work?</h2>

<p>A cookie is a small bit of information used by some web sites. When you visit the site that uses cookies, the site might ask your browser to place one or more cookies on your hard disk.

<p>Later, when you return to the site, your browser sends back the cookies that belong to the site. 

<p>By default, this activity is invisible to you, and you won't know when a site is setting a cookie or when your browser is sending a web site's cookie back. However, you can set your preferences so that you will be asked before a cookie is set. For information on how to do this, see <a href="using_priv_help.html#privacy_levels">Setting Privacy Levels</a>.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="privacy_how"></a>
<a NAME="cookies:foreignIDX"></a>
<h3>How Do Sites Use Cookie Information?</h3>


<p>Cookies allow a site to know something about your previous visits. 
For example, if you typically search for local weather or purchase books at a web site, the site may use cookies to remember what city you live in or what authors you like, so it can make your next visit easier and more useful. 

<p>Reputable web sites publish privacy policies that describe how they use the information they receive. 

<p>When in doubt, check a web site's privacy policy before permitting a cookie to be set and before providing any personal information (such as your name and email address). To learn how to do this, see <a href="using_priv_help.html#form_forms">Viewing Privacy Policies</a>. 

<p>For information on how to manage cookies with the aid of published privacy policies, see <a href="using_priv_help.html#privacy_levels">Setting Privacy Levels</a>. 
</p>

<a NAME="third-party_cookiesSDX"></a>
<a NAME="cookies:foreignIDX"></a>
<h3>What Are Foreign Cookies?</h3>

<p>If your browser stores a site's cookie, it will return the cookie only to that particular site. Your browser will not provide one site with cookies set by another. Since a web site can only receive its own cookies, it can keep learn about your activities while you are at that site but not your activities in general while surfing the Web.

<p>But sometimes one web site displays content that is hosted on another web site.  That content can be anything from an image to text or an advertisement. In such cases, the second web site also has the ability to store a cookie in your browser, even though you did not visit that site directly.

<p>Cookies that are stored by the site other than the one you
think you are visiting are called <b>foreign cookies</b> or <b>third-party cookies.</b> If you
want, you can adjust your preferences so that sites can store ordinary cookies only but not foreign ones.

<p>You use the Cookie Manager to specify what types of cookies you want your browser to accept. For details, see <a href = "using_priv_help.html#cookie_prefs">Privacy &amp; Security Preferences - Cookies</a>.

<a NAME="privacy_unauth"></a>
<h2>How Can I Make Sure Unauthorized People Don't Use Information About Me?</h2>

<p>The best way to keep your information private is to be cautious about providing it to others. The Internet is a public network. When you send your name, phone number, address, and other personal information over the network (via a web page, email, or any other method), it is possible, though unlikely, that someone else can intercept it.</p>

<p>If a web site asks for information about you, you should always check the site's privacy policy before proceeding. Here are some questions you might ask about a web site's privacy policy:

<ul>
<li>What kinds of personal information is this site gathering?
<li>How will the site use the information?
<li>Will the site share the information with others and do I have choices regarding the use of any shared information?
<li>Can I access some or all of the information a site gathers about me, in order to inspect or update it?
<li>How does the site protect the information?
<li>How do I contact the web site if I have questions or problems?
</ul> 

<p>For information about checking a web site's privacy policy, see <a href="using_priv_help.html#form_forms">Viewing Privacy Policies</a>.
