<h1>Privacy on the Internet</h1>

<p>The Internet is a public network of millions of computers, all sharing information. On the Internet, communications move back and forth across public lines and through numerous connections. As with all public lines, eavesdropping is possible.</p>

<p>Fortunately, your browser contains features that safeguard security. There are also several things you personally can do to safeguard your privacy and security while on the Internet. Click one of the links below to learn more.</p>

<p>In addition to the information in this document, you can always find the latest news about security at Netscape's <a href="http://home.netscape.com/security/index.html" target="_blank">Security Center</a>.  For more information about privacy and security, including information about viruses, secure email, safe online shopping and banking, and safe surfing for children, see

<h2>How Does a Web Site Gather Information About Me?</h2>

<p>There are two ways that a site can obtain information about you: 

<ul>
<li>When you request to view a page from a site, a certain amount of information is disclosed in the page request that your browser makes on your behalf.
<p>
<li>If you fill out and submit an online form, the information you filled in is sent to the site.
</ul>

<p>There are two ways for sites to store information about you:

<ul>
<li>While your browser is getting a page from a web site, the site could ask your browser to store a small amount of information about you on your own hard disk. This stored information is called a "cookie." A site that stores (or "sets") a cookie will ask your browser to let it read the cookie the next time you visit.
<p>
<li>Any information you give a web site (by filling out an online form) could be stored on the web site's computers.
</ul>

<p>A web page <b>can't</b> find out your e-mail address, name, or any 
other personal information unless you explicity provide it. 
You are in control---nobody can obtain personal information about 
you unless you allow it.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="privacy_visit"></a>
<h2>What Information Does My Browser Give to a Web Site?</h2>

<p>When you request to view a web page from a site---which you do each time you click a link or type a URL---a small amount of information is given to the site. This information includes your operating environment, your Internet address (<i>not</i> your email address), and the page you're coming from.

<p><b>Operating Environment</b>

<p>The site is told something about your operating environment, such as
your browser type and operating system. This helps the site present the page 
in the best way for your screen. For example, the site might learn that you 
use the French version of a mozilla-based browser on a Windows 2000 computer.

<a name="ip"></a>
<p><b>Internet Address</b>

<p>Your browser must tell the site your Internet address (also known as the Internet Protocol, or IP address) so the site knows where to send the page you are requesting. The site can't present the page you want to see unless it knows your IP address.

<p>Your IP address can be either temporary or fixed (static).

<p>If you connect to the Internet through a standard modem that's attached to your phone line, then your Internet Service Provider (ISP) assigns you a temporary IP address each time you log on. You use the temporary IP address for the duration of your Internet session. Each ISP has many IP addresses, and they assign the addresses at random to users. A web site can tell which ISP a temporary IP address comes from, but it can't learn anything about you personally from your temporary IP address.

<p><b>Important:</b> Your IP address is <b>not</b> your email address. Your email address uniquely identifies you in cyberspace just as your social security number identifies you in the real world. A temporary IP address is no more a part of your identity than the phone number 
of a pay telephone you use to make a call.

<p>If you have DSL, a cable modem, or a fiber-optic connection, you may have a fixed IP address that you use every time you connect.

<p>Whether your IP address is temporary or fixed, you might not want that information
to be given to a site you intend to visit. To block your IP address from being given out, see <a href="#privacy_anon">Browsing Anonymously</a>.

<p><b>Referring Page</b>

<p>The site is also told which page you were reading when you clicked the 
link to the page you are now requesting. This allows the site to know which 
site referred you. Or, as you traverse the site, it allows the site to know 
which of its pages you came from.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="privacy_cookies"></a>
<h2>What Are Cookies, and How Do They Work?</h2>

<p>A cookie is a small bit of information used by some web sites. When you visit the site that uses cookies, the site might ask your browser to place one or more cookies on your hard disk.

<p>Later, when you return to the site, your browser sends back the cookies that belong to the site. 

<p>By default, this activity is invisible to you, and you won't know when a site is setting a cookie or when your browser is sending a web site's cookie back. However, you can set your preferences so that you will be asked before a cookie is set. 

<h3>Why Permit Cookies?</h3>

<p>There are times when it would be to your advantage to allow
a site to know something about your previous visits. 
For example, if you were previously filling out a long form and got as
far as page 17, it would be nice if the site could take you immediately
to page 17 on your next visit. 

<h3>Why Reject Cookies?</h3>

<p>If a site can store a cookie, it can keep track of everything you've done 
while visiting the site by writing these things into a cookie that it keeps
updating. In this way, a site can build a profile on you.

<p>This may be a good thing or a bad thing depending on what the site 
does with the information. For example, it might be good if
a bookseller knew you frequently looked for information on dogs so 
it could tell you about a new dog book. It might be bad if the bookseller then 
sold that information to the local dog pound so they could cross-check 
for potential dog owners who do not have valid dog licenses.

<h3>How Do Sites Use Cookie Information?</h3>

<p>Web sites can use cookie information to tailor their presentations to you, and advertisers can use such information to target online ads to your interests and buying information. Reputable web sites have prvacy policies that describe how they use the information they receive.

<p>When in doubt, always check a web site's privacy policy before permitting a cookie to be set, and before providing any personal information (such as your name and email address).</p>

<a name="privacy_foreign"></a>
<h3>Encountering Foreign Cookies</h3>

<p>If your browser stores a site's cookie, it will return the cookie only to that particular site. Your browser will not provide one site with cookies set by another. Since a web site can only receive back its own cookies, it can keep track of your activities while you are at that site but not your activities in general while surfing the Web.

<p>But suppose that while you visit site ABC.com, a cookie gets
stored not by ABC.com but by a different site called XYZ.com.
ABC.com can cause that to happen very simply by displaying an image from
XYZ.com. So when you visit ABC.com your browser makes a side-trip to 
XYZ.com to get the image, and XYZ.com stores the cookie at that time.

<p>If XYZ.com enlists many sites to display its cookie-storing image, 
it can build up a cookie that contains information about your behavior at 
all those sites. The more sites that display XYZ.com's image, 
the more encompassing a profile it can build on you.

<p>Such cookies that are stored by the site other than the one that you
think you are visiting are called <i>foreign cookies</i>. If you
are concerned about foreign cookies but not about ordinary cookies, 
you could give permission for sites to store ordinary cookies only but 
not foreign ones.

<p>You use Cookie Manager to specify what types of cookies 
you want your browser to accept.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="privacy_unauth"></a>
<h2>How Do I Make Sure Unauthorized People Don't Use Information About Me?</h2>

<p>The best way to keep your information private is to be cautious about providing it to others. The Internet is a public network, and you should assume that when someone asks you for your name, phone number, address, and other information, they may share that information with others.</p>

<p>Providing your name, address, and phone number on the web is like having a listing in the telephone book. In fact, if you are listed in the white pages of the telephone book, your name, address, and phone number are probably listed in online directories and other databases on the World Wide Web. (Try looking yourself up in a directory such as People Finder or Yellow Pages.)</p>

<p>If a web site asks for information about you, always check the site's privacy policy before proceeding. Here are some questions you might ask about a web site's privacy policy:

<ul>
<li>What kinds of personal information is this site gathering?
<li>How will the site use the information?
<li>Will the site share the information with others, for purposes unrelated to my dealing with the site?
<li>Can I access some or all of the information a site gathers about me, in order to inspect or update it?
<li>How does the site keep intruders from viewing the information?
<li>How do I contact the web site if I have questions or problems?
</ul> 


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="privacy_anon"></a>
<h2>Browsing Anonymously</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>When you request to see a page from a site, your browser must tell the site your <a href="#ip">Internet address</a> (IP address) so the site knows where to send the page. Your IP address can be either temporary or fixed (static).

<p>Whether your IP address is temporary or fixed, you might not want that information to be given to a site you intend to visit. But if your browser doesn't provide this information, the site won't know where to deliver the requested page. So this is the one piece of information that you can't ask
your browser not to reveal.

<p>If you really want to hide your IP address from the site, you need to
use some trusted intermediate site. You go to the intermediate site
and tell it the name of the site whose page you want. The intermediate
site requests the page on your behalf, using its own IP address as the
return address. Then, when it gets the page, it forwards it on to
you. The site that supplied the page never gets to see your IP address.

<p>There are several sites that provide such services. Use your favorite
search engine to find them---try search words such as "anonymous" and
"surfing".

<h1>Personal Security Manager</h1>

<p>Personal Security Manager helps you protect the security of your communications over the Internet. Personal Security Manager can check the security settings of web sites you visit and help assure security in several ways.</p>

<p>Personal Security Manager has its own extensive online Help, including general information about maintaining security on the Internet, and definitions of security-related terminology.</p>

<p>To access Personal Security Manager and view its Help, open the Tasks menu, choose Privacy and Security, and then choose Security Manager. Personal Security Manager also appears when you click a lock icon in the browser window.</p>

<h1>Cookie Manager</h1>

<p>A cookie is a small amount of information used by some web sites. A web site that sets cookies will ask your browser to place one or more cookies on your hard disk when you visit the site. Later, when you return to the site, your browser sends back the cookies that belong to the site.</p>

<p>Before loading a web page that uses cookies, your browser handles the page's cookies by doing two things:

<ul>
<li>Accepts or rejects any requests by the web site to <b>set</b> (store) one or more cookies on your computer.
<li>Accepts or rejects any requests by the web site to <b>read</b> cookies it previously stored on your computer. A web site can't actually read cookies or any other data on your computer---instead, your browser gets the cookies and sends them back to the web site.

<h2>Specifying How Your Browser Should Handle Cookies</h2>

<p>Your browser lets you specify how cookies should be handled, by setting your cookie preferences and by using the Cookie Manager.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
<li>Under the Advanced category, choose Cookies. (If not options are visible in this category, click to expand the list.)
<li>Click one of the radio buttons:

<ul>
<li><b>Enable all cookies:</b> Choose this to permit all web sites to set cookies on your computer and receive them back during subsequent visits. <b>Note:</b> If you choose this option, and later choose to reject all cookies, you may still have some older cookies stored on your computer (though no new ones will be set).

<li><b>Enable cookies for the originating web site only:</b> <a href="#privacy_foreign">Foreign cookies</a> are not accepted or returned. Cookies received through email (when the message contains a web page) are treated as foreign cookies.

<li><b>Disable all cookies:</b> Choose this to refuse all cookies.
</ul>

<li>If you want to be notified when a web site tries to set a cookie, select "Warn me before accepting a cookie."
</ol>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="cookies_site"></a>
<h2>Mananging Cookies Site-By-Site</h2>

<p>If you select "Warn me before accepting a cookie" in the Cookie Preferences (see Step 4 above), Cookie Manager lets you control cookies on a site-by-site basis.</p>

<p>When you are warned that a web site is requesting to set a cookie, you can click Yes to allow or No to deny the cookie. You can also select the option for your browser to "Remember this decision."</p>

<p>If you select "Remember this decision," you will not be warned the next time that site tries to set or modify a cookie, and your "yes" or "no" response will still be in effect.</p>

<p>If you wish to change a remembered response later, use Cookie Manager as follows:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Tasks menu, choose Privacy and Security, and then choose Cookie Manager.</li>
<li>Click the Cookies Site tab.</li>
<li>The web sites for which you have allowed or denied cookies are listed. Removing a site from the list resets its status, so the next time you visit that site you will be warned if the site attempts to set a cookie.</li>
</ol>

<p>Another way to control cookies site-by-site is to use the Allow and Block menu options.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Tasks menu, choose Privacy and Security, and then choose Cookie Manager.</li>
<li>Choose "Allow cookies from this site," or "Block cookies from this site."</li>
</ol> 


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="cookies_view"></a>
<h2>Viewing Cookies</h2>

<p>You can use the Cookie Manager to view detailed information about cookies.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Tasks menu, choose Privacy and Security, and then choose Cookie Manager.
<li>Select View Stored Cookies from the submenu. The Cookie Manager window opens with a list of all the cookies stored on your computer.</li>
<li>To see details for a particular cookie, click it. The table below explains the information you see.</li>

<h1>Password Manager</h1>

<p>Many web sites require you to type a user name and password before you can enter the site. For instance, personalized pages and web sites containing your financial information require you to log in.</p>

<p>The user name and password you use at a particular site can be read by the site's administrator. If this concerns you, you may wish to use a different password at every site with which you register. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to remember every single password you've ever used.

<p>Password Manager can help you by storing your user names and passwords on your computer's hard disk, and entering them for you automatically when you visit such sites.</p>

<h2>Using Password Manager to Remember User Names and Passwords</h2>

<p>When you enter your user name and password at a web site a dialog box appears asking, "Do you want Password Manager to remember this logon?" You can choose the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Yes</b>. The next time you return to the web site you'll see that your user name and password are already filled in.</li>

<li><b>No</b>. Password Manager won't remember the user name and password, but will ask again the next time you visit the site.</li>

<li><b>Never for this site</b>. Password Manager will not ask in the future if you want to save your user name and password for that site.</li>
</ul>

<p>Password Manager saves your user names and passwords on your own computer in a file that's difficult, but not impossible, for an intruder to read. See <a href="#sec_encrypt">Encrypting Stored Sensitive Information</a> for information on protecting your stored user names and passwords with encryption technology.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="passwords_auto"></a>
<h2>Entering User Names and Passwords Automatically</h2>

<p>If you use Password Manager to remember your user name and password for a web site, then the next time you visit the site Password Manager will automatically fill in your user name and password on the site's log in screen.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="passwords_onoff"></a>
<h2>Turning Password Manager On and Off</h2>

<p>Password Manager is on by default. To turn it off:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.

<h1>Form Manager</h1>

<p>Many web pages contain forms for you to fill out---order forms for online shopping, information databases, and so forth.</p>

<p>Form Manager can save the personal data you need to enter when you fill out a form, by storing such information as name, address, phone, credit card numbers, and so forth. Then, when a web site presents you with a form, Form Manager can fill it out automatically.</p>

<a NAME="form_saveinfo"></a>
<h2>Saving Information From Forms</h2>

<p>When you fill out an online form, Form Manager normally detects the form and gives you an opportunity to save the personal data you entered into the form. Soon, Form Manager will have enough data to begin filling out forms automatically.</p>

<p>There are two ways to save personal data:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each time you submit an online form that you've filled out, Form Manager asks if you want the information saved. Click Yes. (Note: Form Manager prompts you only if its automatic notification feature is turned on.)

<li>After you fill out a form (but before you submit it), open the Edit menu and choose Save Form Data. You can use the Interview form for this purpose:

<ol>
<li>Open the Tasks menu, choose Privacy and Security, and then choose Form Manager.
<li>Select Interview from the submenu.
<li>Fill out as many fields as you want.
<li>When you're finished with the Interview form, open the Edit menu and choose Save Form Data.
</ol>

</ul>

<p>Form Manager stores your personal data on your own computer in a file that's difficult, but not impossible, for an intruder to read. See <a href="#sec_encrypt">Encrypting Stored Sensitive Information</a> for information on protecting your information with encryption technology.


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="form_auto"></a>
<h2>Filling Out Forms Automatically</h2>

<p>To fill out an online form automatically:</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the online form you want to fill out.
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Prefill Form.
</ol>


<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="form_notify"></a>
<h2>Form Manager's Automatic Notification Feature</h2>

<p>Form Manager is set to prompt you to save information whenever it detects that you have filled out an online form. If you don't want to see these prompts, do this:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
<li>Under the Advanced category, choose Forms. (If no options are visible in this category, click to expand the list.)
<li>In the Form Manager section, deselect "Save form data from web pages when completing forms."
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="form_forms"></a>
<h2>What Happens If I Provide Personal Information to a Web Site?</h2>

<p>If you provide personal information such as your name, phone number, email address, and so forth, the web site is free to store that information in its database and use it later. A web site might use this information to improve its service to you or target advertising to your interests. A web site could sell the information it has gathered to other companies.

<p>One way to find out how a web site uses the information it gathers is to check its <a href="#privacy_unauth">privacy policy</a>.

<p>Before providing personal information on an online form, you must decide whether or not you trust the company---just as you judge whether or not you trust a catalog company before you provide your credit card number on the company's order form.

<h1>Encrypting Stored Sensitive Information</h1>

<p>If you use Password Manager or Form Manager to save passwords and personal data, then this sensitive information is stored on your computer in a file that's difficult, but not impossible, for an intruder to read.</p>

<p>If you are not concerned about unauthorized use of your computer, you may not need further security. However, if your computer is in an area where unauthorized people have access to it, it's possible for a determined person to read the file containing your sensitive information.</p>

<p>For a greater degree of security, you may want to protect the file with encryption. Encryption makes it nearly impossible for an unauthorized person to view your stored sensitive information.</p>

However, you can log out of your Personal Security Password so that it must be entered again before any sensitive information can be stored or retreived. This is useful if you are going to leave your computer unattended for a period of time.</p>

<p>To log out of your Personal Security Password:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Tasks menu, choose Privacy and Security, and then choose Password Manager.
<li>Select Log Out from the submenu.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What to Do If You Forget Your Personal Security Password</h2>

<p>If you forget your Personal Security Password, you may have to reset it. In this case, you will need to clear all the sensitive information stored by Password Manager and Form Manager, because without your original Personal Security Password you will not be permitted to use the information.

<p>To reset your Personal Security password:

<ol>
<li>Open the Tasks menu, choose Privacy and Security, and then choose Security Manager.
<li>The Personal Security Manager window appears. Click the Help button to read about what to do when you forget your Personal Security Password.
</ol>

<p>To clear all stored passwords and other sensitive information:

<ul>
<li>Open the Tasks menu, choose Privacy and Security, and then choose Password Manager.
<li>Select Clear Sensitive Information from the submenu.
</ul>

<p>After you clear the saved personal information, you must remember all the user names and passwords Password Manager had stored for you, so you can enter them when you visit the web sites that require them.</p>
