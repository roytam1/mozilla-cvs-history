<h2>Viewing Your Home Page</h2>

<p>When you start Mozilla, you see Navigator, your browser. The Mozilla home page appears automatically in the browser window when you first launch Mozilla.</p>

<p>If you're viewing the Mozilla page for the first time, explore it. Click the items on the page to learn more about mozilla.org and things that you can do to assist the project if you are interested. When you are ready to begin using Mozilla, you may use the url bar at the top of Navigator to navigate to another page. See below for more information on moving to another page.</p>

<p>After the first launch, you will normally see your home page when you launch Mozilla. Unless you choose a home page yourself, your home page will be mozilla.org.</p>

<p>To choose your own home page, see "Specifying How Mozilla Starts Up" in <i>Customizing Mozilla</i>. (Open the Help menu, choose Help Contents, and click <i>Customizing Mozilla</i>.)</p>

<p>Some pages are divided into rectangular areas called frames. Each frame can display other pages.</p> 

<p>To view more than one page at a time, open the File menu and choose New Navigator Window. At first the new window displays a copy of your home page, but you can use it to view a different page by navigating with the url bar at the top of the page. See below for me details on moving to another page.</p>

<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="nav_move"></a>
<h2>Moving to Another Page</h2>

<p>You move to a new page by typing its URL---its location (address) on the Web. URLs normally begin with the abbreviation "http://," followed by one or more names that identify the address. For instance, "http://mozilla.org"</p>

<ol>
	<li>Double-click the Location bar to select the URL that is already there. 
	<li>Type the URL of the page you want to visit. The URL you type replaces any text already in the Location bar.
	<li>Press Enter.
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Don't know a URL?</b> You can type part of a URL, such as "cnn" (for www.cnn.com); or type a general word, such as "gifts" or "flowers." Navigator guesses what page you want to view, or displays a page with a choice of links related to the word you typed.</p>
<p>If you are new to the Internet, type this URL to view a tutorial for novices: 
http://home.netscape.com/netcenter/newnet</p> <!-- ZLL: Should this remain? -->

<h2>Clicking a Link</h2>
<p>Most web pages contain links you can click to move to other pages.</p>
<ol>
<li>Move the pointer until it changes to a pointing finger. This happens whenever the pointer is over a link. Most links are underlined text, but buttons and pictures can also be links.</li>
<p></p>
<li>Click the link once. While the network locates the page the link points to, status messages appear at the bottom of the window to inform you of the progress loading the page.</li>

<h2>Visiting Bookmarked Pages</h2>

<p>The addresses, or URLs, of web pages can be quite long and difficult to remember. Fortunately, it's not necessary to memorize URLs in order to browse the Web. Your browser has a list of bookmarks, which are pointers to web pages that you have saved so that you can go back to them later. To go to a bookmarked page:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the Bookmarks menu. The menu contains bookmarks represented by a bookmark icon, and folders that contain more bookmarks grouped into categories.</li>
	<li>To visit a bookmarked page, choose a bookmark from the menu, or open a folder and choose a bookmark.</li>
</ol>
<p>Remember: To retrace your steps, click the Back arrow.
<p>You can save your own bookmarks to point to pages you frequently visit, and to other interesting places on the Web. See <i>Customizing Mozilla</i> for instructions. (Open the Help menu, choose Help Contents, and click <i>Customizing Mozilla</i>.)</p>

<a name="Sidebar:usingIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_sidebar"></a> 
<h2>Using the Sidebar</h2>

<p>In addition to navigating the Web with Navigator, you can let the Web come to you by using the Sidebar.</p>

<p>The Sidebar is a customizable frame in your browser where you can keep items and access information that you need to use all the time---the latest news and weather, your address book, or stock quotes, a calendar---and many other options you can choose. The Sidebar presents these items to you in tabs that it continually updates.</p>

<p>Mozilla comes with some Sidebar tabs already set up, but you can customize the Sidebar by adding, removing, and rearranging tabs. For details, see Customizing Mozilla. (Open the Help menu, choose Help Contents, and click <i>Customizing Mozilla</i>.)</p>

<p>To view an item in the Sidebar, click its tab.</p>

<a NAME="nav_searchweb"></a>
<h2>Fast Searches</h2>

<p>There are three ways to search quickly: from the Location bar, from the Sidebar, and from the Net Search page.

<a NAME="searchfield"></a>
<h3>Searching From the Location Bar</h3>

<p>Searching for web pages on a particular topic is as easy as typing a question, 
  or just a word or two, into the browser's Location bar, as pictured below.</p>
<p><img src="images/search.gif" width="334" height="33"></p>

<p>For example, if you want to find information about baby dolls:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Double-click in the Location bar to select the current text. 
  <li>Type the word "baby doll". Your typing replaces the current text. 
  <li>Peform one of these steps:<br>
    a. Click the Search button.<br>
    b. Select or click the drop-down search option in the Location Bar. The default 
    search engine you choose in Preferences is used (Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; 
    Navigator &gt; Internet Search).<br>
    Search results for "baby doll" appear in both the browser window and in the 
    Sidebar. Click the links to visit Web pages about baby dolls. 
</ol>

<p>After you perform a search, the results are saved in the Sidebar's Search tab until you do a new search. You don't have to click the Back button to retrieve the search results, just choose another result in the Search Sidebar.</p>

<p>To save the results of a search, click Bookmark this Search. To return to the list later, Open the Bookmarks menu. You'll find the search results in a folder at the bottom of the Bookmarks menu.

<a NAME="searchsb"></a>
<h3><a name="Sidebar:searching_fromIDX"></a>Searching From The Sidebar</h3>

<p>The Sidebar Search tab lets you quickly search and bookmark your search 
  results. For example, if you want to find information about toy cars:</p>

<ol>
<li>If it is not already open, open the Sidebar by clicking its handle.
<li>Click the Search tab.
  <li>Type "toy car" in the search field. 
  <li>Click Search. Search results for 'toy car' appears in both the browser window 
    and in the Sidebar. Click the links to visit web pages about toy cars. 
</ol>

<p>If the Sidebar Search tab contains a list of search engines from which to 
  choose, then it is set to search in advanced mode. You can keep it that way, 
  or change to a basic setting in Preferences (Edit &gt; Preferences &gt; Navigator 
  &gt; Internet Search). 
<p>To save the results of a search from the Sidebar, click the Bookmark this Search button. To return to the list later, Open the Bookmarks menu. You'll find 
  the search results in a folder at the bottom of the Bookmarks menu. 
<a name="search:using_the_Search_buttonIDX"></a><h3>Searching From the Net Search page</h3>

<p>The Net Search page lets you type in a Search 
  term or phrase, or explore several categories (such as Arts & Entertainment, 
  Business, and many more) that may interest you. To visit the Net Search page, 
  perform one of these steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Click on the Search button <img src="images/search_personal_toolbar.gif" width="66" height="20"> 
    on the Personal Toolbar.
  <li>Open the Search menu and choose Search the Web. 
</ul>
<p>
[&nbsp;<A HREF="#nav_search">Return to beginning of section</A>&nbsp;]
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="search:Advance_modeIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_smartsearch"></a> 
<h2>Advanced Search Mode</h2>

<p>You can set the Sidebar Search tab to Advanced mode, which lets you narrow a search or choose one or more search engines.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu, select Preferences, open Navigator, and select Internet 
    Search. Select Advanced in the Sidebar Search Tab preference. 
  <li>If it is not already open, open the Sidebar by clicking its handle.
<li>Click the Search tab in the Sidebar.
<li>Open the "Within" pop-up menu, and choose a category (such as music or shopping).</li>
<li>Choose one or more search engines for the selected category.
<li>In the search field, type the word for which you want to search.</li>
<li>Click Search.</li>
</ol>

<p>&nbsp; <IMG SRC="images/searchmusic.gif" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" alt="Side Bar Search on Madonna"> 
</p>
<p>To save the results of a search, click the Bookmark Search Results button. To return to the list later, Open the Bookmarks menu. You'll find the search results in a folder in the Bookmarks menu.

<a name="SideBar:search_categoriesIDX"></a>
<h3>Customizing Search Categories</h3>
<p>You can specify which search engines should be used for different categories of searches.</p>
<ol>
  <li> Open the Edit menu, select Preferences, open Navigator, and select Internet 
    Search. Select Advanced in the Sidebar Search Tab preference. 
  <li>If it is not already open, open the Sidebar by clicking its handle. 
  <li>Click the Search tab in the Sidebar. 
  <li>Open the "Within" pop-up menu, click &quot;Edit Categories&quot;. The Edit 
    Categories window appears. 
  <li>From the Categories pop-up menu, choose the category you want to customize.<br>
    Or<br>
    To create a new category, click New and type a name for the category. The 
    pop-up menu displays the name of the selected category. 
  <li>Do one of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li>To add a search engine for the selected category, highlight the search 
        engine in the list on the left, and click Add. 
      <li>To remove a search engine for the selected category, highlight the engine 
        in the list on the right, and click Remove. 
      <li>To rename the selected category, click Rename and type a new name. 
      <li>To delete the selected category, click Delete. 
    </ul>
  <li>Click OK when you are fininshed customizing. 
</ol>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="bookmarks:boomarking_search_resultsIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_savesearch"></a> 
<h2>Bookmarking Search Results</h2>
<p>To save your search results as bookmarks:
<ol>
<li>Perform a search from the <a href="#searchfield">Location bar</a> or from the <a href="#searchsb">Sidebar Search tab</a>.
  <li>After the search results are displayed in the Sidebar, click Bookmark this 
    Search. 
  <li>Open the Bookmarks menu. Your search results appear in one of the folders 
    in your list of bookmarks. For instance, if you searched for "toy car," your 
    bookmark list contains a folder labeled "toy car" containing bookmarks for 
    toy car web pages. 
</ol>
<p>
[&nbsp;<A HREF="#nav_search">Return to beginning of section</A>&nbsp;]
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="search:setting_preferencesIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_searchprefs"></a> 
<h2>Setting Search Preferences</h2>

<p>By default, when you click Search the Netscape search engine is used. Netscape's search uses the Netscape Open Directory project (the largest human-edited directory on the Web), and the Google search engine.</p>

<p>If you like, you can designate a different search engine as the default. You can also specify how you want search results displayed in the Sidebar.</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
<li>Under the Navigator category, click Internet Search. (If no options are visible in this category, click to expand the list.)
<li>Specify your search settings.
</ol>
<p>
[&nbsp;<A HREF="#nav_search">Return to beginning of section</A>&nbsp;]
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="Internet_Keywords:usingIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_keywords"></a> 
<h2>Using Internet Keywords</h2>
<p>Internet Keywords work with the Location bar to help you quickly find specific types of information. There are several ways to use Internet Keywords:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type a specific product, trademark, or company name and press Enter (Return on Mac OS), to go directly to a company's web site.
<li>Type certain general words, such as "vacations" or "gifts," to view a page with several links and resources related to the general word.
<li>Type certain verbs, such as "shop" or "quote," followed by a modifier, to get specific information. For instance, "shop pets" takes you to a page with links to online pet stores.
<li>Type the name of a city or town followed by certain modifiers such as "movies" or "restaurants," for local information. For instance, type "san francisco restaurants".
</ul>
<p><b>Shortcut:</b> The most commonly used Internet Keywords are listed in the pull down menu to the left of the location bar. Click the triangle and choose from the list. To see a longer list of keywords, choose List of Keywords.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> To use Internet Keywords, you must press Enter on your keyboard (Return on Mac OS) instead of clicking the Search button. Pressing Enter activates the Internet Keyword feature; clicking Search initiates a search.</p>
<p>To see the difference, try this:
<ol>
<li>Type "apple imac" into the Location bar and press Enter (Return). Apple Computer's iMac Web page appears.
<li>Now type "apple imac" into the Location bar and click Search. You see a list of links related to Apple Computer's iMac models.
</ol>
<p>If typing Internet Keywords into the Location bar is not working for you, check your <a href="#nav_smartbrowse">Smart Browsing preferences</a> to be sure the Internet Keywords feature is enabled.</p>
<h3>Quick Stock Quotes</h3>
<p>To see a recent stock quote for a company, type "quote" followed by the company's stock ticker symbol, and press Enter.</p>
<p>If you don't know a company's stock ticker symbol, type the company's name. The Quote page will list all companies with similar names, and you can choose the one for which you want a quote.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="web_pages:finding_relatedIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_related"></a> 
<h2>Finding Related Pages</h2>

<p>Whenever you visit a web page, your browser generates a list of related pages for you to consider. The What's Related list is displayed in the Sidebar.</p>

<table cellpadding="5">
<tr>
    <td> <IMG SRC="images/sidebarclosed_small.gif" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" alt="Closed Sidebar"> 
    </td>
    <td valign="middle"> 
      <p>If it is not already open, open the Sidebar by clicking its handle.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The What's Related list may be closed, so that only its tab is showing. To open it, click its tab.</p>
<p>To visit one of the web pages in the What's Related list, click its link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="nav_smartbrowse"></a>
<h3>Smart Browsing Preferences</h3>
<p>If you prefer not to use What's Related or Internet Keywords, you can turn these features off.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.
<li>Under the Navigator category, choose Smart Browsing. (If no options are visible in this category, click to expand the list.)
<li>Under "What's Related," list any domains for which you do not want What's Related information. Domain names are the part of a URL that contains the name of an organization, business, or school---such as netscape.com or washington.org.
<li>Remove the checkmark next to "Enable Internet Keywords." Keep the checkmark if you want to type common words or brand names (instead of full URLs) in the Location bar.
</ol>

<p>What's Related works by gathering information on the browsing habits of a huge number of Internet users. If you do not wish What's Related information to be gathered in conjunction with your browsing, you can disable What's Related by turning off or removing the What's Related tab from the Sidebar. See "Removing Sidebar Tabs" in <i>Customizing Mozilla</i>. (Open the Help menu, choose Help Contents, and click <i>Customizing Mozilla</i>.)</p>

<h2>Searching Within a Page</h2>
<p>To find text within the page you are currently viewing:
<ol>

    frames, you may need to click within a frame before you begin your search.

<li><b>Search backwards:</b> Choose this to search backwards.
</ul>
<li>Click Find to begin the search. 
</ol>
<p>To find the same word or phrase again:</p>

<h2>Saving All or Part of a Page</h2>
<p>To save an entire page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the File menu and choose Save Page As.
<li>In the Save File dialog box, choose a folder in which to save this file.
<li>Type a name for the page and click Save.
</ol>
<p>When you view a page containing frames and a frame is currently selected, the pop-up menu's Save Frame As option is offered in addition to Save Page As. This lets you save only the page within the selected frame.</p>
<p>Saving a file onto your hard drive lets you view the page (or its HTML code) when you're not connected to the Internet.</p>
<p>To save an image from a page:</p>
<ol>
<li>Position the mouse pointer over the image.
<li>Right-click the image (on Mac OS, press the Control key and click the mouse button) to display a pop-up menu.
<li>Choose Save Image As.
<li>In the Save File dialog box, choose a folder in which to save this image.
<li>Type a name for the image and click Save.
</ol>
<p>To save a page without displaying it (which is useful for retrieving a nonformatted page, like a data file, that's not intended for viewing):</p>
<ol>
<li>Position the mouse pointer over the page's link.
<li>Right-click the page's link (on Mac OS, press the Control key and click the mouse button) to display a pop-up menu.
<li>Choose Save Link As.
<li>In the Save File dialog box, choose a folder in which to save this file.
<li>Type a name for the page and click Save.
</ol>
<p><B>Important:</B> Some links automatically download and save files to your hard drive after you click them. The URLs for these links often begin with "ftp" or end with a file-type extension such as "au" or "mpeg." These links might transmit software, sound, or movie files, and can launch helper applications that support the files.</p>

<h2>Selecting Character Codings and Fonts</h2>
<p>If you browse, compose, or send and receive email in more than one language, you need to select the appropriate character codings and fonts.</p>
<p>A character coding method is the way a document or message has been converted to data to be used by your computer. All web documents and mail and news messages use a character coding method (also known as a character encoding or character set).</p>
<p>The character coding method for a document depends on its language. Some languages---such as most of the Western languages---share the same coding method. Others, such as Chinese, Japanese, and Russian, use different method.</p>

<p>Your version of Mozilla is probably set to default character coding(s) appropriate for your region. However, If you use more than one language you may need to select appropriate character coding methods and designate the fonts you wish to use for use coding method.</p>

<p>To select character codings:
<ol>
<li>Open the View menu, choose Character Coding, and then choose More.
<li>Choose a character coding method from the first section of the submenu. Repeat for each character coding method you want.
</ol>
<p>The character coding methods you select are added to the bottom of the Character Coding menu. If you have more than one coding method selected, the active one has a bullet (dot) next to it.

<p>Mozilla can detect which character coding a document uses, and can display it correctly on your screen. To take advantage of this capability:

<ol>
<li>Open the View menu, choose Character Coding, and then choose Auto-Detect.
<li>Choose one of the Auto-Detect options, or choose Auto-Detect Off.
</ol>
<p>To make changes to your list of active character sets:
<ol>
<li>Open the View menu, choose Character Coding, and then choose Customize.
<li>Choose from the following procedures:
<ul>
<li>To add to the list of active character sets, choose a character set from the list on the left and click Add.
<li>To remove a character set from the active list,  choose a character set from the list on the right and click Remove.
<li>To change the order in which the browser checks for character sets, highlight character sets in the list on the right, and use the arrow buttons to move the character sets up or down in the list.
</ul>
</ol>
<p>To change the default fonts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  <li>Under the Appearance category, choose Fonts. (If no options are visible, 
    click to expand the list.) 
  <li>From the "Fonts for" pop-up menu, choose a character coding method. For 
    instance, to set default fonts for the Western character set, choose "Western." 
  <li>Select whether proportional text should be serif (like Times Roman) or sans-serif 
    (like Arial). You can also specify what font size you want for proportional 
    text. Propotional text is variable in width, so characters and letters vary 
    in width. 
  <li>(If available) Select a font for Serif, Sans-Serif, Cursive, and Fantasy. 
  <li>Select a monospace font (like Courier) you want to use for web pages which request a monospace font. Monospace 
    text is fixed in width, so each character or letter takes the same amount 
    of space. 
</ol>
<p>Many web page authors choose their own fonts and font sizes. You can use the 
  author's font settings by selecting "Allow documents to use other fonts."</p>
<p>To adjust the readability of fonts, type a number for your preferred resolution 
  in the field next to "Display resolution." 96 dpi (dots per inch) is the standard 
  resolution, but you may want to choose a larger value.</p>

<h2>Setting Language Preferences</h2>
<p>Web pages are sometimes available in several languages. Mozilla presents 
  pages in the language you prefer, if it is available. You can specify the languages 
  you wish to see, in order of preference.</p>
<p>To set language preferences:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  <li>Under the Navigator category, choose Languages. (If no options are visible, 
    click to expand the list.)

    type the language and its code in the Others field (see Note, below). If you 
    want to reorder the languages in the list, select a language and click Move 
    Up or Move Down. 
  <li>Click OK. 
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> Two-letter codes enclosed in brackets appear next to each language

<h2>Managing Different File Types</h2>
<p>Navigator can handle many types of files. However, for some files, such as 
  movies, Navigator launches a "helper" application that can handle the file, 
  or it saves the file for you to view later.</p>
<p>The settings in the Helper Applications preferences panel tell Navigator which 
  helper applications to use on your computer. You probably don't need to change 
  them because they come preconfigured. Also, if Navigator doesn't know which 
  helper application to use, it guides you in finding one within the download 
  dialog box. From there, you can specify that Mozilla should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use the default action.</li>
  <li>Save the file.</li>
  <li>Open the application using the program you choose.</li>
</ul>
<p>For experienced users to fine-tune the Helper Applications preferences:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  <li>Under the Navigator category, choose Helper Applications. (If no options 
    are visible, click to expand the list.) 
</ol>
<p>To add a new helper application to the list: 
<ol>
  <li>Click New Type. 
  <li>Type a description of the type of files the application works with; for 
    instance, "movies" or "sound files." 
  <li>Type the file extension (suffix) used by this file type. If this type of 
    file uses more than one extension, type them all, separated by spaces. 
  <li>Type the MIME type. MIME types consist of two words separated by a slash. 
    For instance, a TIFF image file's MIME type is "image/tiff". If you don't 
    know the MIME type, leave the field blank. <br>
    <b>Note: </b>When you download a file, Mozilla will show you the MIME type 
    on the download dialog box. 
  <li>Click Choose, then select an application that handles files of this type. 
  <li>Click OK. 
</ol>
<p>To specify how Navigator should handle downloaded files: 
<ol>
  <li>Select a file type from the list and click Edit. 
  <li>Choose a "Handled By" option to have downloaded files saved on your hard 
    disk or opened in an application that you specify. Click Choose to specify 
    the application. 
  <li>Select "Ask me before opening downloaded files of this type" if you want 
    to be notified before downloading files that are handled by applications other 
    than Navigator. 
  <li>Click OK. 
</ol>
<p>To remove an item from the list: 
<ol>
  <li>Select the item and click Remove. 
  <li>Click OK or Cancel in response to the warning dialog. 
</ol>

<h2>Automatic Loading</h2>
<p>When you bring a web page to your screen, Mozilla automatically loads (starts 
  up) several features that help interpret web pages. These features can make 
  web pages more lively, but they take time to load.</p>
<p>To turn off automatic loading:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  <li>Click the Advanced category. 
  <li>To speed things up, deselect one or both: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Enable Java:</b> Allows Java applets (small programs that add functionality 
        to pages) to run automatically. 
      <li><b>Enable JavaScript:</b> Allows JavaScript (commands that add functionality 
        to pages) to run automatically. You can enable JavaScript for the browser 
        (Navigator), Mail and News, or both. 
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>To save time typing your password when you use "anonymous" as your user ID 
  for an FTP site, choose "Send email address as anonymous FTP password." Choosing 
  this option transmits your email address automatically when you log on to a 
  public FTP (File Transfer Protocol) site. FTP sites are used for transferring 
  files.</p>

<a name="cache:changing_settingsIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_cache"></a> 
<h2>Changing Cache Settings</h2>
<p>Your computer stores copies of frequently accessed pages in the memory cache 
  or disk cache. This way, the computer doesn't have to retrieve the page from 
  the network each time you view it.</p>
<p>To set the size of the memory cache or to clear it (Windows and Unix only):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  <li>Under the Advanced category, choose Cache. (If no options are visible in 
    this category, click to expand the list.) 
  <li>Enter a number in the Memory Cache field to specify the size of the memory 
    cache. 1024K to 2000K is a good size. To clear the memory cache immediately, 
    click Clear Memory Cache. 
</ol>
<p><B>Important:</B> A larger memory cache allows more data to be quickly retrieved. 
  But unless you have a lot of extra memory on your computer, 1024K is large enough.</p>
<p>To set the size of the disk cache or to clear it:</p>
<ol>
  <li>From the Edit menu, choose Preferences. 
  <li>Open the Advanced category; then click Cache. 
  <li>Enter a number in the Disk Cache field to specify the size of the disk cache. 
    8000K (5000K on Unix) is a good size. To clear the disk cache immediately, 
    click Clear Disk Cache. 
</ol>
<p><B>Important:</B> A larger disk cache allows more pages to be quickly retrieved, 
  but more of your hard disk space is used.</p>
<p>When you quit Mozilla, it performs cache maintenance. If maintenance takes 
  longer than you wish, try reducing the size of the disk cache.</p>
<p>To specify how often Navigator checks the network for page revisions (so that 
  you don't keep "stale" pages in the cache too long):</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  <li>Under the Advanced category, choose Cache. (If no options are visible in 
    this category, click to expand the list.) 
  <li>Select &quot;Every time I view the page,&quot; &quot;Automatically,&quot; 
    "Once per session," or "Never." "Every time I view the page" assures that 
    the page you see is always the latest, at the cost of slower performance. 
    &quot;Automatically&quot; compares a web page to the cache when the page is 
    determined to be old. "Never" is fastest, but the page you see might not be 
    the latest information.. 
</ol>
<p>If pages that should be in the cache are taking longer to appear than they 
  should, make sure the preference is not set to "Every time I view the page," 
  because the verification requires a network connection that takes time.</p>
<p>To refresh a page at any time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Click the Reload button in the browser's navigation bar. The computer checks 
    the network to make sure you have the latest version of the page. 
</ul>
<p>To retrieve a fresh copy of a page regardless of what's in the cache:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hold down the Shift key (Option key on Mac OS) and click Reload. 
</ul>

  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences.</li>
  <li>Under the Advanced category, choose Software Installation. (If no options

<p>This section explains how to how to work with proxies. 
<p><a NAME="nav_prox"></a> </p>
<h2>Setting Proxy Values</h2>
<p>Many organizations block access from the Internet to their networks. This prevents 
  outside parties from gaining access to sensitive information. The protection 
  is called a firewall.</p>
<p>If your organization has a firewall, the browser may need to go through a proxy 
  server before connecting you to the Internet. The proxy server prevents outsiders 
  from breaking into your organization's private network.</p>
<p>Before you start:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If there's a proxy configuration file at your workplace, ask the system 
    administrator for its URL. 
  <li>If there's no proxy configuration file, ask your system administrator for 
    the names and port numbers of the servers running proxy software for each 
    network service. 
</ul>
<p>To set the browser to work with the proxy:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  <li>Under the Advanced category, choose Proxies. (If no options are visible 
    in this category, click to expand the list.) 
  <li>Select one of the following: 
    <ul>
      <li><b>Direct connection to the Internet:</b> Choose this if you don't have 
        to go through a proxy. 
      <li><b>Manual proxy configuration:</b> Choose this if you don't have a proxy 
        configuration file. Type the name or numeric IP address of the proxy server 
        for HTTP and FTP. Type each proxy server's port number in the Port field.</li>
      <li><b>Automatic proxy configuration URL:</b> Choose this if you have a 
        proxy configuration file. Type the file's URL in the field and click Reload. 
    </ul>
</ol>
<p>(If you select Manual proxy configuration) In the "No Proxy for:" field, type 
  the names of any domains that you can connect to directly, bypassing the proxy. 
  For example, if you type "mozilla.org", then the proxy is bypassed each time 
  you view a web page from mozilla.org.</p>
<p>Domain names are the part of a URL that contains the name of an organization, 
  business, or school---such as netscape.com or washington.org. If you use local 
  host names without the domain name, list them the same way. Use commas to separate 
  multiple hostnames. The wildcard character [*] cannot be used.</p>
