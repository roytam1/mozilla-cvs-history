<h1>Building, Configuring and Testing Python XPCOM Package</h1>
<p>This document attempts to explain how to build, configure and test the
Python XPCOM Package. This document assumes you have already successfully
built
Mozilla from source and your environment is currently set up for such a build -
see the <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/build/">Mozilla build documentation</a>
for more information.</p>
<p>This section covers:</p>

<h2><a name="ConfigureTheEnvironment">Configuring your Environment</a></h2>
<p>In addition to the existing environment requirements for building Mozilla itself, the
Python XPCOM package has the following requirements:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<a name="MozillaDirectory"><b>Mozilla Directory</b></a><b> - </b>Ensure the Mozilla
<i> bin</i> directory is on your PATH
(LD_LIBRARY_PATH
on Unix) so Python can locate the <i> xpcom.dll</i> module needed for
core XPCOM services.</li>
  <li><a name="PYTHONPATH"><b>PYTHONPATH</b></a> - <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt> needs to be set appropriately.&nbsp;Ensure
the parent to this <i>xpcom</i> directory is on your path so &quot;import
xpcom&quot; locates this directory.&nbsp; Note that the Mozilla <i>components</i> directory does not need to be on the <tt>PYTHONPATH</tt>,
but any modules used by your components must be set correctly.&nbsp; If anything
is wrong here you should get a normal <tt>ImportError</tt>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <p>Note that on Windows, the PYTHONPATH is generally maintained in the
  Registry; however, you can set this variable at a DOS prompt, and it will still be
added to the core PYTHONPATH.
</blockquote>
<h2><a name="BuildingTheExtensions">Building</a></h2>
<p>The initial release of the Python XPCOM package has a very simple, hard-coded
build process.&nbsp; The intention is to include this package in the Mozilla
source tree, and integrate the build with the Mozilla build.&nbsp; Until this
happens, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ensure you can successfully build Mozilla itself from source-code.</li>
  <li>Unpack this source code, and change to the <i>xpcom</i> directory under
    the root <i>PyXPCOM</i> directory.</li>
  <li>For Windows, edit <i>makefile.stupid.win</i>, while for Linux, edit <i>makefile.stupid.linux</i></li>
  <li>As per the instructions at the top of the makefile, edit the MOZ_SRC,
    INSTALLDIR and PYTHON_SRC definitions appropriately.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Build Example: Building on Windows</h3>
<p>For this example, we will assume that the source-code for Mozilla is in C:\src\mozilla,
the source-code for the PyXPCOM package is in <i>c:\src\pyxpcom</i>. Further, we assume
that you have Python 2.0 installed in <i>C:\Python20</i>, and wish to install
the built Python XPCOM package so it exists in <i>C:\Python20\xpcom</i>.</p>
<p>To build the package in this environment, you would perform the following
steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unpack the PyXPCOM package source-code into the appropriate directory</li>
  <li>Edit makefile.stupid.win with the following changes:<br>
    <i>MOZ_SRC=c:\src<br>
    INSTALLDIR=C:\Python20<br>
    PYTHON_SRC=C:\Python20</i></li>
  <li>&nbsp;From the top-level Python xpcom source directory (i.e., the
    directory with <i>makefile.stupid.win</i>), execute the command:<br>
    <i>nmake -f makefile.stupid.win install</i></li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: To build a Debug version of the Python XPCOM library, you can add <i>DEBUG=1</i>
to the nmake command-line.</p>
<p>If everything appears to work and you are brave, you may also like to execute
<i>make -f makefile.stupid.win test</i> to execute the test script.&nbsp;
Otherwise, continue to the following section where we confirm the installation
step-by-step.</p>
<h3>Build Example: Building on Linux</h3>
<p>For this example, we will assume that the source-code for Mozilla is in ~/src/mozilla,
the source-code for the PyXPCOM package is in ~/src/pyxpcom. Further, we assume
that you have ActivePython 2.0 installed in <i>/usr/local/ActivePython2.0</i>,
and wish to install the built Python XPCOM package so it exists in <i>/usr/local/ActivePython2.0/lib/python2.0/site-packages/xpcom</i>.</p>
<p>To build the package in this environment, you would perform the following
steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unpack the PyXPCOM package source-code into the appropriate directory</li>
  <li>Edit makefile.stupid.linux with the following changes (substituting
    username accordingly):<br>
    <i>MOZ_SRC=/home/username/src<br>
    INSTALLDIR=/usr/local/ActivePython-2.0/site-packages<br>
    PYTHON_SRC=/usr/local/ActivePython-2.0</i></li>
  <li>Build: As a regular user, from the top-level Python xpcom source
    directory (i.e., the directory with <i>makefile.stupid.linux</i>), execute
    the command:<br>
    <i>make -f makefile.stupid.linux DEBUG=1</i></li>
  <li>Install: Log in as a user with permissions to install into the relevant directories
    (usually the root user).&nbsp; From the top-level Python xpcom source
    directory (i.e., the directory with <i>makefile.stupid.linux</i>), execute
    the command:<br>
    <i>make -f makefile.stupid.linux DEBUG=1 install</i></li>
  <li>Switch back to a regular user, ready for testing!</li>
</ul>
<p>NOTE: The instructions above are for a Debug build, as this is the default
Mozilla build type.&nbsp; If you have configured Mozilla to build a Release
version of Mozilla, you can drop the DEBUG=1 option.&nbsp; It is important that
PyXPCOM and Mozilla itself are consistent with respect to Release and Debug
builds.&nbsp; For more details, please consult the makefile.</p>
<p>If everything appears to work and you are brave, you may also like to execute
<i>make -f makefile.stupid.linux test</i> to execute the test script.&nbsp;
Otherwise, continue to the following section where we confirm the installation
step--by-step.</p>
<h2><a name="RunningTheTests">Testing your Setup</a></h2>
<p>The Python XPCOM Package has a complete test suite.&nbsp; If you are
impatient, you can simply execute <i>make -f makefile.stupid.linux test</i> (for
Linux) or <i>nmake -f makefile.stupid.linux test</i> (for Windows).&nbsp; If
this command indicates that the tests succeeded, then you can ignore the rest of
this section.</p>
<p>In the rest of this section, we walk through some simpler tests a step at a time,
to help diagnose any problems.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> We recommend you do all your testing outside of <i> mozilla.exe</i>; it is far simpler to test all of
this using the PyXPCOM package stand-alone.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> On Windows, if you use a debug build of Mozilla (i.e., in <i>dist\WIN32_D.OBJ\bin)</i>,
    you <b>must</b> use <i>python_d.exe</i>; if you use a release build (i.e., in
    a <i>dist\WIN32_O.OBJ\bin</i> directory), you must use <i>python.exe</i>.&nbsp;
<i>makefile.stupid.win</i> handles this automatically.</p>
<p>To test your setup:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start Python, and check<br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; <i>import xpcom</i><br>
    works. If not, <a href="#PYTHONPATH">check your PYTHONPATH</a> - the
    main PyXPCOM package can not be located..</li>
  <li>Check<i><br>
    &gt;&gt;&gt; import xpcom._xpcom</i><br>

works. If not, then most likely your <a href="#MozillaDirectory">Mozilla
    directory is not on your path</a>, or something is wrong with <i>_xpcom(_d).pyd/_xpcommodule.so</i>.</li>

  <li>Next run a simple test: <i>test/test_misc.py</i>.&nbsp;With a Windows debug build, the command may look like:<br>
    <i>C:\Anywhere&gt; python_d \src\python\xpcom\test\test_misc.py<br>
    </i>or on Linux<br>
    <i>/home/user/src/mozilla/dist/bin$ python /home/user/src/python/xpcom/test/test_misc.py</i></li>
</ol>
<p>If you can't get this going, you won't get much further! If you do, the
next step is to register our test component and run our full test suite.</p>
<h2><a name="Registration">Registering the Loader and Test Component</a></h2>
<p>First register the generic Python loader. For instructions, see the <a href="file:///F:/src/as/Komodo/src/pyxpcom/xpcom/doc/architecture.html">architecture
document</a>.&nbsp;Do this only once, regardless of how many
Python components you have.&nbsp; Then install the test component itself, and
finally you can test it!</p>
<h3>Registering the Python Loader and Component</h3>
<p>To register the Python Loader and Component:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ensure the build process has put <i>pyloader.dll </i>(or <i>modpyloader.so</i>
    for Unix), and the files <i> py_test_component.py </i> and <i> py_test_component.idl</i> into
    the Mozilla <i>bin/components</i> directory.&nbsp; If not, copy the files
    there manually.</li>
  <li>Run <i>regxpcom</i>.&nbsp;<i>regxpcom</i> is a standard Mozilla
    executable, found in the <i>bin</i>  directory, that detects whether the DLL and .py
    files have been added and registers them accordingly.&nbsp; You should
    see a few messages that include the following:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <pre>Registering: PythonComponentLoader
Registered 1 Python components in pyloader.dll
nsNativeComponentLoader: autoregistering succeeded
Auto-registering all Python components in F:\src\mozilla\dist\WIN32_D.OBJ\bin\components
Registering: PythonTestComponent
Registered 1 Python components in py_test_component.py</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>If so (or you see no message at all), you are ready to run the test suite.</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: If you execute this same step a second time, you will not
see any of the above mentioned messages.&nbsp;XPCOM knows that nothing has
changed since you last ran <i>regxpcom</i>, so nothing is registered.&nbsp; If
you do not see these messages the first time you run it, there is the
possibility that some other process, possibly the build process, has already
executed this step.</p>
<h2><b>Running the Test Suite</b></h2>
<p>To run the test suite, run <i>xpcom/test/regrtest.py.</i>&nbsp; This runs the
tests and ensures that the test output is as expected.&nbsp; If all tests
pass, you have a fully functioning Python XPCOM package.&nbsp; Enjoy!</p>
