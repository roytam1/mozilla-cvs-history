<h1>Registering for a Screen Name</h1>

<p>Registering for a Screen Name through Netscape allows you to create a free 
personal ID that lets you &quot;sign on&quot; (also called &quot;sign 
in&quot;), or enter your login name and password, only once to access many popular sites 
and services.</p>

<h2><a name="benefits"></a>Screen Name Benefits</h2>
<p>Benefits of registering for a Screen Name include:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Convenient Single &quot;Sign-On&quot;:</b> When you are online, you need 
to sign on only once with your Screen Name and password. You can then visit popular 
participating web sites within the Screen Name Service (SNS) network without 
repeatedly having to enter a different user name and password for each site. You can also use the SNS network to speed your registration with new web sites within the network.</li>
<li><b>Private, Stored Profile That You Control:</b> With the Screen Name Service 
you get a secure profile that stores your web site registration information. 
When you go to a site that participates in the SNS network, you don't have to 
enter the same information all over again. You have control over what information 
you want participating sites to have, and you can choose which fields of information 
you wish to share with the sites. You can later update and edit the information 
for your Screen Name.</li>
<li><b> Security and Privacy:</b> Netscape and SNS will authenticate all your 
information when you register at a participating Screen Name Service site. For 
more information, read the <a href="http://screenname.aol.com/_cqr/homePg/hpController/controller.psp?siteId=snshomepage&siteState=&hpState=hpPrivacyPolicy" target="_blank">Screen 
Name Service Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>

Name Help</a>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="services"></a>Using Your Screen Name with Netscape Services</h2>
<p>Your Screen Name gives you a safe, secure, and convenient way to access and 
personalize services from Netscape, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li> Access email from anywhere through Netscape Webmail.</li>
<li>Track important dates and appointments anywhere using Netscape calendar.</li>
<li>Send messages instantly to your friends and family with AOL Instant Messenger.</li>
<li>Read customized weather, news, local information, and horoscopes and more 
at My Netscape.</li>
<li>Many other <a href="http://channels.netscape.com/ns/jump/tools/" target="_blank">Netscape 
Tools</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to Netscape, you can use your Screen Name at AOL and other participating 
sites. </p>
<p>[&nbsp;<a href="#registration">Return to beginning of section</a>&nbsp;] </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2><a name="existing"></a>Using an Existing Screen Name</h2>
<p>If you are a member of AOL, AOL Instant Messenger (AIM), Netscape AOL Instant 
Messenger, CompuServe 2000, or have customized AOL Anywhere, you are ready to 
use the Screen Name Service because you already have a Screen Name.</p>

<h2>Registering a New Screen Name</h2>
<p>If you don't register for a Screen Name during Netscape installation, you 
can register for one through Netscape. </p>
<p>Unless Netscape detects that you have previously registered, you can register 
for a new Screen Name as part of Netscape installation.</p>
<p>After Netscape installation, you can use the Netscape Screen Name registration 
wizard to create a Screen Name. You can open the wizard in the following ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>From any Netscape window:</b> Open the Help menu and choose Register Netscape.</li>
<li><b>When creating a Webmail account in Mail &amp; Newsgroups:</b> </li>
<ol>
<li>Open the File Menu, open New, and choose New Account. The account wizard 
appears.</li>
<li>Select Netscape Webmail and click Next.</li>
<li>Select &quot;I would like to sign up for a new Netscape Webmail account&quot; 
and click Next. The Netscape Screen Name registration wizard appears.</li>
<li>Follow the wizard to complete your Screen Name registration.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: Registering this way automatically sets up a Webmail account that 
you can access through Mail &amp; Newsgroups.</p>
<li><b>When creating a Screen Name to use in Instant Messenger:</b> Click &quot;Register 
new screen name&quot; at the bottom of the Instant Messenger window.</li>
</ul>
