Missing Features
----------------

 sidebar
 the toolbar isn't configurable
 page links bar (UI far <html:link> and extended XLink support)
 alternate stylesheets UI
 dlmgr prefs panel
 hooks for other apps
 help | help contents needs to be (re)added
 help | keyboard shortcuts needs adding
 add dnd support to bookmarks menu (adapt bookmarks button dnd code)

Open Issues
-----------

 the online and security indicators need to go to the left where they won't be accidentally clicked (?)
 about mozilla needs to be a dialog
 personal toolbar d&d is fubar (moreso than in the trunk)
 need to readd platformNavigationOverlay.xul once proper makefiles are in win/unix directories (this is why View | Full Screen is missing and things like alt+<-/-> don't work)
 doesn't load homepage upon startup (does in subsequent windows)
 view source should always launch helper app (notepad, emacsclient, bbedit, whatever) -- strip internal view source stuff completely
