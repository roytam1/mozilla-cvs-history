<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Composition - Multi-personality</TD><TD>*</TD><TD>2</TD><TD>Edwin</TD><TD> Working except for prefs. However, the personality question should be answered before we open the composition window (and not in the composition window itself), so that the signature can be added automatically.</TD></TR>

Of course no code will be submitted to mozilla, but a separate codebase will exist outside the US. Cryptix has some PGP code.

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Database - Advanced            </TD><TD>*</TD><TD>5</TD><TD>You?</TD><TD> Next step (after the simple database) is to implement a very fast and scaleable database. Maybe we should implement the MDB interface the mail/news group created and do a simple java implementation so we maintain true cross-platform runnability. If we need speed we can use the native implementations from the mail/news group for a few platforms. These are just some thoughts.</TD></TR>

Of course we can implement some simple filtering, but we want it to be better than any other product.

Also the javamail API contains some mime stuff and I'm not sure if it is used.  I guess this should be done by the same person who is working on the attachments.</TD></TR>

<TR VALIGN="top"><TD>Provider - News                </TD><TD> </TD><TD>2</TD><TD>Edwin</TD><TD> We will use an open source provider under the MPL from Knife. We will abandon the available news code in grendel as this saves work.</TD><TD><A HREF="http://www.dog.net.uk/knife/">Knife</A></TD></TR>

We will abandon the available POP3 code in grendel as it needs work and SUN's provider is working fine now. (It wasn't available when grendel was developed.

Some code is available, but the status is unknown. We should not use the JDK 1.2 dnd stuff, because we want it to work on JDK 1.1. But of course we can steal ideas.</TD></TR>
