Building the Win32 version of DB:

This directory contains project files for both MSVC4.X and 5.0:

	DB_DLL.mdp		Visual C++ 4.0 project file
	DB_DLL.mak		Makefile exported by Visual C++ 4.0.
	Berkeley_DB.dsw		Visual C++ 5.0 project file
	*.dsp			Visual C++ 5.0 subprojects

In MSVC5.0, open the file "Berkeley_DB.dsw".  The 5.0 project files are
fully developed, allowing you to build both DLL and static versions of
libdb, the test harness and the command-line utilities.  If you want to
build absolutely everything, select the "db_buildall" subproject and
build.

In MSVC4.X, first move your distribution directory to \db (so that this
file is \db\build.win32\README for some drive letter).  Then open the file
"DB_DLL.mdp".  The 4.X project files currently only allow you to build
the DLL version of libdb.
