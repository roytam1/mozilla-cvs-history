In order to ensure compatibility with future releases of DB, all fields of

.PP
The result of attempting to forcibly destroy the region when a process
has the region open is unspecified.
Processes using a shared memory region maintain an open file descriptor
for it.
On UNIX systems, the region removal should succeed
and processes that have already joined the region should continue to
run in the region without change,
however processes attempting to join the \\$1 will either fail or
attempt to create a new region.
On other systems, e.g., WNT, where the
.IR unlink (2)
system call will fail if any process has an open file descriptor
for the file,
the region removal will fail.
.PP
In the case of catastrophic or system failure,
database recovery must be performed (see
.IR db_recover (1)
or the DB_RECOVER and DB_RECOVER_FATAL flags to
.IR \\*(Va (3)).
Alternatively, if recovery is not required because no database state is
maintained across failures,
it is possible to clean up a \\$1 by removing all of the
files in the directory specified to the
.I \\*(Vo
.Al function, method,
as \\$1 files are never created in any directory other than the one
specified to

subsystems in this database environment.

.TH DB_LOAD 1 "June 2, 1998"

.SH NAME
db_load \- the DB database loader
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBdb_load\fP [\fB-nT\fP] [\fB-c name=value\fP]
.br
.ti +5
[\fB-f file\fP] [\fB-h home\fP] [\fB-t btree | hash | recno\fP] db_file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I db_load
utility reads from the standard input
and loads it into the database
.IR db_file .
The database
.I db_file
is created if it does not already exist.
.PP
The input to
.I db_load
must be in the output format specified by the
.I db_dump
or
.I db_dump185
utilities (see
.IR db_dump (1)
for more information), or as specified for the
.B \-T
option below.
.PP
The options are as follows:
.TP 5
.B \-c
Specify configuration options for the DB_INFO structure provided to
.IR db_open (3),
ignoring any value they may have based on the input.
The command-line format is ``name=value''.
Supported keywords are listed below.
.TP 5
.B \-f
Read from the specified
.I input
file instead of from the standard input.
.TP 5
.B \-h
Specify a home directory for the database.
.sp
If a home directory is specified, the database environment is opened
using the DB_INIT_LOCK, DB_INIT_LOG, DB_INIT_MPOOL, DB_INIT_TXN and
DB_USE_ENVIRON flags to
.IR db_appinit (3).
(This means that
.I db_load
can be used to load data into databases while they are in use by other
processes.)
If the
.I db_appinit
call fails, or if no home directory is specified, the database is still
updated, but the environment is ignored, e.g., no locking is done.
.TP 5
.B \-n
Do not overwrite existing keys in the database when loading into an
already existing database.
If a key/data pair cannot be loaded into the database for this reason,
a warning message is displayed on the standard error output and the
key/data pair are skipped.
.TP 5
.B \-T
The
.B \-T
option allows non-DB applications to easily load text files into databases.
.sp
If the database to be created is of type
.B btree
or
.BR hash ,
the input must be paired lines of text,
where the first line of the pair is the key item,
and the second line of the pair is its corresponding data item.
If the database to be created is of type
.BR recno ,
the input must be lines of text,
where each line is a new data item for the database.
.sp
A simple escape mechanism, where newline and backslash (``\e'') characters
are special, is applied to the text input.
Newline characters are interpreted as record separators.
Backslash characters in the text will be interpreted in one of two ways:
if the backslash character precedes another backslash character, the pair
will be interpreted as a literal backslash.
If the backslash character precedes any other character, the two characters
following the backslash will be interpreted as hexadecimal specification of
a single character, e.g., ``\e0a'' is a newline character in the ASCII
character set.
.sp
For this reason, any backslash or newline characters that naturally occur
in the text input must be escaped to avoid misinterpretation by
.IR db_load .
.sp
If the
.B \-T
option is specified, the underlying access method type must be specified
using the
.B \-t
option.
.TP 5
.B \-t
Specify the underlying access method.
If no
.B \-t
option is specified, the database will be loaded into a database of the
same type as was dumped,
e.g., a hash database will be created if a hash database was dumped.
.sp
