DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       The  DB  library  is  a family of groups of functions that
       provides a modular programming interface  to  transactions
       and  record-oriented  file  access.   The library includes
       support for transactions, locking, logging and  file  page
       caching,  as well as various indexed access methods.  Many
       of the functional groups  (e.g.,  the  file  page  caching
       functions)  are  useful  independent of the other DB func-
       tions, although  some  functional  groups  are  explicitly
       based  on  other functional groups (e.g., transactions and
       logging).  For a general description of  the  DB  package,
       see _d_b___i_n_t_r_o(3).

  _d_b___v_e_r_s_i_o_n
       The _d_b___v_e_r_s_i_o_n function returns a pointer to a string con-
       taining DB version information.  If _m_a_j_o_r is non-NULL, the
       major version of the DB release is stored in the memory it
       references.  If _m_i_n_o_r is non-NULL, the  minor  version  of
       the  DB release is stored in the memory it references.  If
       _p_a_t_c_h is non-NULL, the patch version of the DB release  is
       stored in the memory it references.

  _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t
       The  _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t function provides a simple way to initial-
       ize and configure the DB environment.  It is not necessary
       that  it be called, but it provides a method of creating a
       consistent environment for processes using one or more  of
       the features of DB.

       The  _d_b___h_o_m_e  and  _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g  arguments  to _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t are
       described in the section below entitled ``FILE NAMING''.

       The _f_l_a_g_s argument specifies the subsystems that are  ini-
       tialized  and  how the environment affects DB file naming,
       among other things.   The  _f_l_a_g_s  value  is  specified  by
       oorr'ing together one or more of the following values:

       DB_CREATE
            Cause  subsystems  to create any underlying files, as
            necessary.  (See _d_b___l_o_c_k(3), _d_b___l_o_g(3),  _d_b___m_p_o_o_l(3),
            _d_b___o_p_e_n(3) and _d_b___t_x_n(3) for more information.)

       DB_INIT_LOCK
            Initialize  the lock subsystem; see _d_b___l_o_c_k(3).  This
            subsystem should be used when multiple  processes  or
            threads  are  going  to  be  reading and writing a DB
            database, so that they do  not  interfere  with  each
            other.   If all threads are accessing the database(s)
            read-only, then locking  is  unnecessary.   When  the
            DB_INIT_LOCK  flag is specified, it is usually neces-
            sary to run the deadlock detector, _d_b___d_e_a_d_l_o_c_k(1), as
            well.

       DB_INIT_LOG
            Initialize  the  log  subsystem; see _d_b___l_o_g(3).  This
            subsystem is used when recovery from  application  or
            system failure is important.

       DB_INIT_MPOOL
            Initialize  the  mpool  subsystem;  see  _d_b___m_p_o_o_l(3).
            This subsystem is used whenever  the  application  is
            using the DB access methods for any purpose.

       DB_INIT_TXN
            Initialize  the transaction subsystem; see _d_b___t_x_n(3).
            This subsystem is used  when  atomicity  of  multiple
            operations   and   recovery   are   important.    The
            DB_INIT_TXN flag implies the DB_INIT_LOG flag.

       DB_MPOOL_PRIVATE
            Create a private memory  pool  (see  _d_b___m_p_o_o_l(3)  for
            further  information).   Ignored unless DB_INIT_MPOOL
            is also specified.

       DB_NOMMAP
            Do not map any files  within  this  environment  (see
            _d_b___m_p_o_o_l(3) for further information).  Ignored unless
            DB_INIT_MPOOL is also specified.

       DB_RECOVER
            Run normal recovery on this environment before  open-
            ing  it  for  normal  use.   If this flag is set, the
            DB_CREATE flag must also be  set  since  the  regions
            will be removed and recreated.

            The   _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t  function  returns  successfully  if
            DB_RECOVER is specified and no log files exist, so it
            is  necessary  to  ensure all necessary log files are
            present before running recovery.  For further  infor-
            mation,  consult  the  man page for _d_b___a_r_c_h_i_v_e(1) and
            _d_b___r_e_c_o_v_e_r(1).

       DB_RECOVER_FATAL
            Run catastrophic recovery on this environment  before
            opening  it for normal use.  If this flag is set, the
            DB_CREATE flag must also be  set  since  the  regions
            will be removed and recreated.

            The   _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t  function  returns  successfully  if
            DB_RECOVER is specified and no log files exist, so it
            is  necessary  to  ensure all necessary log files are
            present before running recovery.  For further  infor-
            mation,  consult  the  man page for _d_b___a_r_c_h_i_v_e(1) and
            _d_b___r_e_c_o_v_e_r(1).

       DB_THREAD
            Ensure that handles returned by the DB subsystems are
            useable  by multiple threads within a single process,
            i.e., that the  system  is  ``free-threaded''.   (See
            _d_b___l_o_c_k(3),  _d_b___l_o_g(3),  _d_b___m_p_o_o_l(3),  _d_b___o_p_e_n(3) and
            _d_b___t_x_n(3) for more information.)

       DB_TXN_NOSYNC
            On transaction commit, do not synchronously flush the
            log (see _d_b___t_x_n(3) for further information).  Ignored
            unless DB_INIT_TXN is also specified.

       DB_USE_ENVIRON
            The DB process' environment may be permitted to spec-
            ify information to be used when naming files (see the
            section entitled ``FILE NAMING'' below).  As  permit-
            ting users to specify which files are used can create
            security problems, environment  information  will  be
            used  in  file  naming  for  all  users  only  if the
            DB_USE_ENVIRON flag is set.

       DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT
            The DB process' environment may be permitted to spec-
            ify information to be used when naming files (see the
            section entitled ``FILE NAMING'' below).  As  permit-
            ting users to specify which files are used can create
            security problems, if the DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT flag is
            set,  environment  information  will be used for file
            naming only for users with a user-ID matching that of
            the  superuser  (specifically,  users  for  whom  the
            _g_e_t_u_i_d system call returns the user-ID 0).

       The DB environment is configured based on the _d_b_e_n_v  argu-
       ment  to  _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t, which is a pointer to a structure of
       type DB_ENV (typedef'd in <db.h>).  Applications will nor-
       mally  use  the  same  DB_ENV  structure  (initialized  by
       _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t(3)), as an argument to all of the subsystems in
       the DB package.

       References  to  the DB_ENV structure are maintained by DB,
       so it may not be discarded until the last close  function,
       corresponding  to  an  open  function  for which it was an
       argument, has returned.  In order to ensure  compatibility
       with  future  releases  of  DB,  all  fields of the DB_ENV
       structure  that  are  not   explicitly   set   should   be
       initialized  to  0  before the first time the structure is
       used.  Do this by  declaring  the  structure  external  or
       static,  or  by  calling the C library routine _b_z_e_r_o(3) or
       _m_e_m_s_e_t(3).

       The fields of the DB_ENV structure used by _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t  are
       described  below.  The _d_b_e_n_v argument may not be NULL.  If
       any of the fields of the _d_b_e_n_v  are  set  to  0,  defaults
       appropriate for the system are used where possible.

       The  following  fields in the DB_ENV structure may be ini-
       tialized before calling _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t:

       void (*db_errcall)(char *db_errpfx, char *buffer);
            When an error occurs in  the  DB  package,  an  _e_r_r_n_o
            value  is  returned  by the function.  In some cases,
            however, the _e_r_r_n_o value may be insufficient to  com-
            pletely describe the cause of the error.

            If  _d_b___e_r_r_c_a_l_l  is  non-NULL,  it  may be called with
            additional error information.  The _d_b___e_r_r_p_f_x argument
            is  the  current  environment's _d_b___e_r_r_p_f_x field.  The
            _b_u_f_f_e_r argument contains a nul-terminated string with
            the additional information.

            This  error  logging  facility should not be required
            for normal operation, but may be useful in  debugging
            applications.

       FILE *db_errfile;
            The   _d_b___e_r_r_f_i_l_e   field  behaves  similarly  to  the
            _d_b___e_r_r_c_a_l_l field, except that the  error  message  is
            written to the file stream represented by _d_b___e_r_r_f_i_l_e.

            If _d_b___e_r_r_p_f_x is non-NULL, the message  will  be  pre-
            ceded  by the string referenced by _d_b___e_r_r_p_f_x, a colon
            (``:'') and a space.  The message will be followed by
            a newline character.

       const char *db_errpfx;
            A  prefix  to  prepend to error messages.  Because DB
            does not copy the memory referenced by the  _d_b___e_r_r_p_f_x
            field,  the  application may modify the error message
            prefix at any time.

       int db_verbose;
            Include informational and debugging messages as  well
            as  error  messages  in the _d_b___e_r_r_c_a_l_l and _d_b___e_r_r_f_i_l_e
            output.

       Each of  the  open  functions  that  _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t  may  call
       (_l_o_c_k___o_p_e_n, _l_o_g___o_p_e_n, _m_e_m_p___o_p_e_n and _t_x_n___o_p_e_n) is called as
       follows, where the DB_CREATE flag is optional:

            XXX_open(NULL, DB_CREATE,
               S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP, dbenv)

       This call will cause each subsystem to construct pathnames
       as  described in the section on ``FILE NAMING''.  The sub-
       system has permission to read and write  underlying  files
       as  necessary,  and optionally to create files.  (All cre-
       ated files will be created readable and writeable  by  the
       owner and the group.  The group ownership of created files
       is based on the system and directory defaults, and is  not
       further specified by DB.)

       In  addition,  the  _d_b_e_n_v  argument  is passed to the open
       functions of any  subsystems  initialized  by  _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t.
       For  this  reason the fields of the DB_ENV structure rele-
       vant to the subsystems being initialized  must  themselves
       be  initialized before _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t is called.  See the man-
       ual page for each subsystem for a list of these fields and
       their uses.

       The return value from each of these calls is placed in the
       appropriate field of the DB_ENV structure:

       DB_LOCKTAB *lk_info;
            The return value of the _l_o_c_k___o_p_e_n(3) call.

       DB_LOG *lg_info;
            The return value of the _l_o_g___o_p_e_n(3) call.

       DB_MPOOL *mp_info;
            The return value of the _m_e_m_p___o_p_e_n(3) call.

       DB_TXNMGR *tx_info;
            The return value of the _t_x_n___o_p_e_n(3) call.

       In general, these fields are not directly used by applica-
       tions;  subsystems of DB that use these fields will simply
       reference them using the DB_ENV  argument  passed  to  the
       subsystem.

       For  example,  an  application  using  the  DB hash access
       method functions to access  a  database  will  first  call
       _d_b___o_p_e_n  passing  it  the DB_ENV argument filled in by the
       initial call to _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t.  Then, all future calls to the
       hash  access method functions for that database will auto-
       matically use the underlying  shared  memory  buffer  pool
       that  was  specified  by  the _m_p___i_n_f_o field of that DB_ENV
       argument.

       The single exception to this rule is  the  _t_x___i_n_f_o  field,
       which   applications   must   explicitly  specify  to  the
       _t_x_n___b_e_g_i_n, _t_x_n___c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t and _t_x_n___c_l_o_s_e functions.

       Once the DB environment has been initialized by a call  to
       _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t, no fields other than _d_b___e_r_r_p_f_x should be modi-
       fied.

       The _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t function returns  the  value  of  _e_r_r_n_o  on
       failure and 0 on success.

  _d_b___a_p_p_e_x_i_t
       The  _d_b___a_p_p_e_x_i_t function closes the initialized DB subsys-
       tems, freeing any  allocated  resources  and  closing  any
       underlying subsystems.

       When  multiple threads are using the DB_ENV handle concur-
       rently, only a single thread may call the _d_b___a_p_p_e_x_i_t func-
       tion.

       The  _d_b___a_p_p_e_x_i_t  function  returns  the  value of _e_r_r_n_o on
       failure and 0 on success.

FFIILLEE NNAAMMIINNGG
       The most important task of _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t is to structure file
       naming within DB.

       Each  of the locking, logging, memory pool and transaction
       subsystems of DB require shared memory regions, backed  by
       the  filesystem.   Further,  cooperating  applications (or
       multiple invocations of the same application)  must  agree
       on  the  location  of  the shared memory regions and other
       files used by the DB subsystems, the log files used by the
       logging subsystem, and, of course, the data files.

       Although  it  is possible to specify full pathnames to all
       DB functions, this is cumbersome and requires that  appli-
       cations  be recompiled when database files are moved.  The
       _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t function makes it possible  to  place  database
       files  in  a single directory, or in multiple directories,
       grouped by their function within the database.

       Applications are normally expected  to  specify  a  single
       directory  home for their database.  This can be done eas-
       ily in the call to _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t by specifying  a  value  for
       the  _d_b___h_o_m_e  argument.  There are more complex configura-
       tions where it may be desirable  to  override  _d_b___h_o_m_e  or
       provide supplementary path information.

       The  following  describes  the possible ways in which file
       naming information may be specified  to  the  DB  library.
       The  specific  circumstances and order in which these ways
       are applied are described in a subsequent paragraph.

       _d_b___h_o_m_e
            If the _d_b___h_o_m_e argument to  _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t  is  non-NULL,
            its value may be used as the database home, and files
            named relative to its path.

       DB_HOME
            If the  DB_HOME  environment  variable  is  set  when
            _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t  is  called,  its value may be used as the
            database home, and files named relative to its  path.

       _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g
            The  _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g  argument to _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t may be used to
            specify an array of character strings of  the  format
            ``NAME  VALUE'',  that  specify file name information
            for the  process'  DB  environment.   The  whitespace
            delimiting  the  two parts of the entry may be one or
            more <space> or <tab> characters.  (Leading or trail-
            ing  <space>  and  <tab>  characters  are discarded.)
            Each entry must specify both the NAME and  the  VALUE
            of the pair.  All entries with unrecognized NAME val-
            ues will be ignored.  The  _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g  array  must  be
            NULL terminated.

       DB_CONFIG
            The same information specified to the _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g argu-
            ment to _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t may be specified using a  configu-
            ration  file.   If a database home directory has been
            specified (either by  the  application  specifying  a
            non-NULL  _d_b___h_o_m_e  argument  to _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t, or by the
            application setting the DB_USE_ENVIRON or DB_USE_ENV-
            IRON_ROOT  flags and the DB_HOME environment variable
            being set),  any  file  named  ``DB_CONFIG''  in  the
            database home directory will be read for lines of the
            format ``NAME VALUE''.  The whitespace delimiting the
            two  parts  of the line may be one or more <space> or
            <tab> characters.  (Leading or trailing  <space>  and
            <tab>  characters are discarded.)  All empty lines or
            lines whose first non-whitespace character is a  hash
            character  (``#'')  will  be ignored.  Each line must
            specify both the NAME and the VALUE of the pair.  All
            lines  with unrecognized NAME values will be ignored.

       The following ``NAME VALUE'' pairs in the _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g  argu-
       ment and the DB_CONFIG file are currently supported by DB.

       DB_DATA_DIR
            The path of a directory to be used as the location of
            the  access  method data files, e.g., paths specified
            to the _d_b___o_p_e_n(3) function will be relative  to  this
            path.

            The  DB_DATA_DIR  paths  are additive, and specifying
            more than one will result in each specified directory
            being  searched for database data files.  If multiple
            paths are specified, created data files  will  always
            be created in the ffiirrsstt directory specified.

       DB_LOG_DIR
            The path of a directory to be used as the location of
            logging files, e.g., files created by  the  _d_b___l_o_g(3)
            subsystem  will  be  relative  to this directory.  If
            specified, this is the directory name  that  will  be
            passed to _l_o_g___o_p_e_n(3).

       DB_TMP_DIR
            The path of a directory to be used as the location of
            temporary files, e.g., files created to back  in-mem-
            ory  access method databases will be created relative
            to this path.  Note, these temporary files can poten-
            tially  be  quite large, depending on the size of the
            database.

            If DB_TMP_DIR is not specified, the  following  envi-
            ronment  variables  are checked in order: ``TMPDIR'',
            ``TEMP'', ``TMP'' and ``TempFolder''.  If one of them
            is  set,  temporary files are created relative to the
            directory it specifies.

            If DB_TMP_DIR is not specified and none of the  above
            environment variables are set, the first possible one
            of  the  following  directories  is  used:  _/_v_a_r_/_t_m_p,
            _/_u_s_r_/_t_m_p, _/_t_e_m_p, _/_t_m_p, _C_:_/_t_e_m_p and _C_:_/_t_m_p.

       The  following  describes  the  specific circumstances and
       order in which the different ways of specifying file  nam-
       ing  information  are applied.  Specifically, DB file name
       processing proceeds  sequentially  through  the  following
       steps:

       ``/''
            If  any file name specified to any DB function begins
            with a leading slash, that file name is used  without
            modification by DB.

       DB_CONFIG
            If    a    relevant   configuration   string   (e.g.,
            DB_DATA_DIR), is specified in the DB_CONFIG  configu-
            ration  file,  the VALUE from the ``NAME VALUE'' pair
            is prepended  to  the  current  file  name.   If  the
            resulting  file name begins with a leading slash, the
            file name is used without further modification by DB.

            The  DB_CONFIG configuration file is intended to per-
            mit systems to customize file location for a database
            independent of applications using that database.  For
            example,  a  database  administrator  can  move   the
            database  log  and data files to a different location
            without application recompilation.

       _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g
            If   a   relevant   configuration    string    (e.g.,
            DB_DATA_DIR),  is specified in the _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g argument
            and is not specified in the DB_CONFIG file, the VALUE
            from the ``NAME VALUE'' pair is prepended to the cur-
            rent file name.  If the resulting  file  name  begins
            with  a  leading slash, the file name is used without
            further modification by DB.

            The _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g argument is intended to permit applica-
            tions to customize file location for a database.  For
            example, an application writer can place  data  files
            and  log files in different directories, or instanti-
            ate a new log directory  each  time  the  application
            runs.

       DB_HOME
            If the DB_HOME environment variable was set, (and the
            application has set the appropriate DB_USE_ENVIRON or
            DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT  environment variable), its value
            is prepended  to  the  current  file  name.   If  the
            resulting  file name begins with a leading slash, the
            file name is used without further modification by DB.

            The  DB_HOME environment variable is intended to per-
            mit  users  and  system  administrators  to  override
            application and installation defaults, e.g.,

                 env DB_HOME=/database/my_home application

            Alternatively,  application writers are encouraged to
            support the --hh option  found  in  the  supporting  DB
            utilities to let users specify a database home.

       _d_b___h_o_m_e
            If the application specified a non-NULL _d_b___h_o_m_e argu-
            ment to _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t (and the  database  home  was  not
            already specified using the DB_HOME environment vari-
            able) its value is  prepended  to  the  current  file
            name.  If the resulting file name begins with a lead-
            ing slash, the file name is used without further mod-
            ification by DB.

       (nothing)
            Finally,  all  file names are interpreted relative to
            the current working directory of the process.

       The common model for a DB environment is  one  where  only
       the DB_HOME environment variable, or the _d_b___h_o_m_e argument,
       is specified.  In this case, all data files will  be  pre-
       sumed to be relative to that directory, and all files cre-
       ated by the DB subsystems will be created in  that  direc-
       tory.

       The more complex model for a transaction environment might
       be one where a database home is  specified,  using  either
       the  DB_HOME  environment variable or the _d_b___h_o_m_e argument
       to _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t, and then DB_DATA_DIR and DB_LOG_DIR are set
       to  the  relative path names of directories underneath the
       home directory using the _d_b___c_o_n_f_i_g argument to  _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t
       or the DB_CONFIG file.

EERRRROORRSS
       The  _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t function may fail and return _e_r_r_n_o for any

       functions: DB->close(3), calloc(3), db_appexit(3),

       In addition, the _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t function may fail  and  return
       _e_r_r_n_o for the following conditions:

       [EINVAL]
            An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.

            The  DB_THREAD  flag  was specified and spinlocks are
            not implemented for this architecture.

            The DB_RECOVER or DB_RECOVER_FATAL  flag  was  speci-
            fied, and no log files were found.

            The  DB_HOME or TMPDIR environment variables were set
            but empty.

            An incorrectly formatted ``NAME VALUE'' entry or line
            was found.

       [ENOSPC]
            HP-UX  only:  a previously created DB environment for
            this process still exists.

       The _d_b___a_p_p_e_x_i_t function may fail and return _e_r_r_n_o for  any
       of  the  errors specified for the following DB and library
       functions: lock_close(3), log_close(3), memp_close(3), and
       txn_close(3).

BBUUGGSS
       Due to the constraints of the PA-RISC memory architecture,
       HP-UX does not allow a process to  map  a  file  into  its
       address  space  multiple  times.  For this reason, each DB
       environment may be opened only once by a process on HP-UX,
       i.e., calls to _a_p_p_i_n_i_t will fail if the specified DB envi-
       ronment has been opened and not subsequently closed.

       On Windows/95, files that are opened by multiple processes
       do  not  share data correctly.  To tell Berkeley DB to use
       the paging file to share memory among processes,  use  the
       DB_REGION_NAME  flag  of the _d_b___v_a_l_u_e___s_e_t function.  Obvi-
       ously, you do not need to do this if only a single process
       will be accessing database files.
