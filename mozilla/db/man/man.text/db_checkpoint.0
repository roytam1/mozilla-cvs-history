       The  _d_b___c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t  utility is a daemon process that moni-
       tors the database log and  periodically  calls  _t_x_n___c_h_e_c_k_-
       _p_o_i_n_t(3) to checkpoint it.

       The options are as follows:

       --11   Checkpoint the log once, and then exit.

       --hh   Specify a home directory for the database.

       --kk   Checkpoint  the  database  at least as often as every
            _k_b_y_t_e_s of log file are written.

       --LL   Log the execution of the db_checkpoint utility to the
            specified file in the following format, where ``###''
            is the process ID, and the date is the time the util-
            ity starting running.

            db_checkpoint: ### Wed Jun 15 01:23:45 EDT 1995

            This  file will be removed if the db_checkpoint util-
            ity exits gracefully.

       --pp   Checkpoint the database at least every _m_i_n minutes.

       --vv   Write the time of each  checkpoint  to  the  standard
            output.

       At  least  one of the --11, --kk and --pp options must be speci-
       fied.

       The _d_b___c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t utility attaches  to  DB  shared  memory
       regions.   In  order to avoid region corruption, it should
       always be given the chance to detach and exit  gracefully.
       To  cause _d_b___c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t to clean up after itself and exit,
       send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The _d_b___c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an
       error occurs.

       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of _d_b___c_h_e_c_k_p_o_i_n_t:

       DB_HOME
            If the --hh option is not specified and the environment
            variable  _D_B___H_O_M_E  is  set, it is used as the path of
            the database home, as described in _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t(3).

       The DB library is a family of  groups  of  functions  that
       provides  a  modular programming interface to transactions
       and record-oriented file  access.   The  library  includes
       support  for  transactions, locking, logging and file page
       caching, as well as various indexed access methods.   Many
       of  the  functional  groups  (e.g.,  the file page caching
       functions) are useful independent of the  other  DB  func-
       tions,  although  some  functional  groups  are explicitly
       based on other functional groups (e.g.,  transactions  and
       logging).   For  a  general description of the DB package,
       see _d_b___i_n_t_r_o(3).
