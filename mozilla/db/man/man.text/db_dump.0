       The  _d_b___d_u_m_p  utility  reads the database file _d_b___f_i_l_e and
       writes it to the standard output using  a  portable  flat-
       text  format  understood  by  the _d_b___l_o_a_d(1) utility.  The
       argument _d_b___f_i_l_e must be a  file  produced  using  the  _D_B
       library functions.

       The  _d_b___d_u_m_p_1_8_5  utility is similar to the _d_b___d_u_m_p utility
       except that it reads databases in the format  used  by  DB
       versions 1.85 and 1.86.

       The options are as follows:

       --dd   Dump  the  specified database in a format helpful for
            debugging the DB library routines.  TThhee oouuttppuutt ffoorrmmaatt

       --ff   Write to the specified _f_i_l_e instead of to  the  stan-
            dard output.

       --hh   Specify  a  home  directory  for the database.  As DB
            versions before 2.0 did not support the concept of  a
            database  ``home'',  _d_b___d_u_m_p_1_8_5 does not support this
            option.

       --pp   If characters in either the key  or  data  items  are
            printing  characters  (as defined by _i_s_p_r_i_n_t(3)), use
            printing characters in _f_i_l_e to represent them.   This
            option  permits users to use standard text editors to
            modify the contents of databases.

            Note, different systems may have different notions as
            to  what  characters  are ``printing'', and databases
            dumped in this manner may be less portable to  exter-
            nal systems.

       Dumping and reloading hash databases that use user-defined
       hash functions will result in new databases that  use  the
       default hash function.  While using the default hash func-
       tion may not be optimal for the new database, it will con-
       tinue to work correctly.

       Dumping  and  reloading  btree  databases  that  use user-
       defined prefix or comparison functions will result in  new
       databases that use the default prefix and comparison func-
       tions.  IInn tthhiiss ccaassee,, iitt iiss qquuiittee lliikkeellyy tthhaatt tthhee ddaattaabbaassee

       The only available workaround for either case is to modify
       the  sources  for  the  _d_b___l_o_a_d(1)  utility  to  load  the
       database using the correct  hash,  prefix  and  comparison
       functions.

       The _d_b___d_u_m_p_1_8_5 utility may not be available on your system
       as it is not always installed when the  DB  libraries  and
       utilities  are  installed.   If you are unable to find it,
       see your system administrator for further information.

       The _d_b___d_u_m_p utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error
       occurs.  The _d_b___d_u_m_p_1_8_5 utility exits 0 on success, and >0
       if an error occurs.

       There  are  two  output  formats  used  by   _d_b___d_u_m_p   and
       _d_b___d_u_m_p_1_8_5.

       In  both output formats, the first few lines of the output
       contain  header  information  describing  the   underlying
       access  method, filesystem page size and other bookkeeping
       information.  This information is output in ``name=value''
       pairs, where ``name'' may be any of the keywords listed in
       the _d_b___l_o_a_d(1) manual page,  and  ``value''  will  be  its
       value.  While this header information can be edited before
       the database is reloaded, there is rarely any reason to do
       so,  as  all of this information can be overridden by com-
       mand-line arguments to _d_b___l_o_a_d.

       Following the header information are  the  key/data  pairs
       from  the  database.   If  the database being dumped is of
       type bbttrreeee or hhaasshh, the output will  be  paired  lines  of
       text,  where  the  first line of the pair is the key item,
       and the second line of the pair is its corresponding  data
       item.   If the database being dumped is of type rreeccnnoo, the
       output will be lines of text, where each  line  is  a  new
       data item for the database.

       If the --pp option was specified, each output line will con-
       sist of single characters representing any characters from
       the database that were ``printing'', and backslash (``\'')
       escaped characters for any that were not.  Backslash char-
       acters  appearing in the output mean one of two things: if
       the backslash character precedes another backslash charac-
       ter,  it means that a literal backslash character occurred
       in the key or data item.  If the backslash character  pre-
       cedes  any other character, the next two characters should
       be interpreted as hexadecimal specification  of  a  single
       character,  e.g.,  ``\0a''  is  a newline character in the
       ASCII character set.

       If the --pp option was not specified, each output line  will
       consist  of  paired  hexadecimal  values,  e.g.,  the line
       ``726f6f74'' is the string ``root'' in the ASCII character
       set.

       In  both  output  formats, a single newline character ends
       both the key and data items.

       The following environment variables affect  the  execution
       of _d_b___d_u_m_p:

       DB_HOME
            If the --hh option is not specified and the environment
            variable _D_B___H_O_M_E is set, it is used as  the  path  of
            the database home, as described in _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t(3).

       The  DB  library  is  a family of groups of functions that
       provides a modular programming interface  to  transactions
       and  record-oriented  file  access.   The library includes
       support for transactions, locking, logging and  file  page
       caching,  as well as various indexed access methods.  Many
       of the functional groups  (e.g.,  the  file  page  caching
       functions)  are  useful  independent of the other DB func-
       tions, although  some  functional  groups  are  explicitly
       based  on  other functional groups (e.g., transactions and
       logging).  For a general description of  the  DB  package,
       see _d_b___i_n_t_r_o(3).
