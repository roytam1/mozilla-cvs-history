       The _d_b___d_e_a_d_l_o_c_k utility traverses the database lock struc-
       tures and aborts a transaction  each  time  it  detects  a
       deadlock.  This utility should be run as a background dae-
       mon whenever multiple threads or processes are using lock-
       ing.   By  default,  a  random transaction involved in the
       deadlock is aborted.

       The options are as follows:

       --aa   When a deadlock is detected, abort the oldest (``o'')
            transaction, the youngest (``y'') transaction, or the
            transaction with the minimum number of locks (``m'').

       --hh   Specify a home directory for the database.

       --LL   Log  the  execution of the db_deadlock utility to the
            specified file in the following format, where ``###''
            is the process ID, and the date is the time the util-
            ity starting running.

            db_deadlock: ### Wed Jun 15 01:23:45 EDT 1995

            This file will be removed if the db_deadlock  utility
            exits gracefully.

       --tt   Initiate  a  pass  over  the  database locks at least
            every _s_e_c seconds.

       --vv   Run in verbose mode, generating  messages  each  time
            the detector runs.

       --ww   Make a single pass over the database locks every time
            a process is forced to wait for a lock.

       At least one of the --tt and --ww options must be specified.

       The _d_b___d_e_a_d_l_o_c_k  utility  attaches  to  DB  shared  memory
       regions.   In  order to avoid region corruption, it should
       always be given the chance to detach and exit  gracefully.
       To  cause  _d_b___d_e_a_d_l_o_c_k  to clean up after itself and exit,
       send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The _d_b___d_e_a_d_l_o_c_k utility exits 0 on success, and >0  if  an
       error occurs.

       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of _d_b___d_e_a_d_l_o_c_k:

       DB_HOME
            If the --hh option is not specified and the environment
            variable  _D_B___H_O_M_E  is  set, it is used as the path of
            the database home, as described in _d_b___a_p_p_i_n_i_t(3).

       The DB library is a family of  groups  of  functions  that
       provides  a  modular programming interface to transactions
       and record-oriented file  access.   The  library  includes
       support  for  transactions, locking, logging and file page
       caching, as well as various indexed access methods.   Many
       of  the  functional  groups  (e.g.,  the file page caching
       functions) are useful independent of the  other  DB  func-
       tions,  although  some  functional  groups  are explicitly
       based on other functional groups (e.g.,  transactions  and
       logging).   For  a  general description of the DB package,
       see _d_b___i_n_t_r_o(3).
