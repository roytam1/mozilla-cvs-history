Applications will normally use the same DB_ENV structure (initialized
by

References to the DB_ENV structure are maintained by DB,

has returned.
In order to ensure compatibility with future releases of DB, all fields of
the DB_ENV structure that are not explicitly set should be initialized to 0

Do this by declaring the structure external or static, or by calling the C

.PP
The result of attempting to forcibly destroy the region when a process
has the region open is unspecified.
Processes using a shared memory region maintain an open file descriptor
for it.
On UNIX systems, the region removal should succeed
and processes that have already joined the region should continue to
run in the region without change,
however processes attempting to join the \\$1 will either fail or
attempt to create a new region.
On other systems, e.g., WNT, where the
.IR unlink (2)
system call will fail if any process has an open file descriptor
for the file,
the region removal will fail.
.PP
In the case of catastrophic or system failure,
database recovery must be performed (see
.IR db_recover (1)
or the DB_RECOVER and DB_RECOVER_FATAL flags to
.IR \\*(Va (3)).
Alternatively, if recovery is not required because no database state is
maintained across failures,
it is possible to clean up a \\$1 by removing all of the
files in the directory specified to the
.I \\*(Vo
.Al function, method,
as \\$1 files are never created in any directory other than the one
specified to
.IR \\*(Vo .
Note, however,
that this has the potential to remove files created by the other DB
subsystems in this database environment.
