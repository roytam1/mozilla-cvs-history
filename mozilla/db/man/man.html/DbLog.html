<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  DB  library  is  a  family of classes that provides a
       modular programming interface to transactions and  record-
       oriented  file  access.   The library includes support for
       transactions, locking, logging and file page  caching,  as
       well  as  various  indexed  access  methods.   Many of the
       classes (e.g., the file page  caching  class)  are  useful
       independent of the other DB classes, although some classes
       are explicitly based on other classes (e.g.,  transactions
       and  logging).   For  a  general  description  of  the  DB
       package, see <B><A HREF="db_intro.html">db_intro(3)</A></B>.

       This manual page describes the specific details of the log
       class.

       This  class  provide  a  general-purpose  logging facility
       sufficient for transaction management.  Logs can be shared
       by multiple processes.

       The  DB  transaction  log  is  represented  by a directory
       containing a set of files.  The log is a  record-oriented,
       append-only file, with records identified and accessed via
       DbLsn's (database log sequence numbers).

       DbLsn's are returned on  each  DbLog::put  operation,  and
       only  those  DbLsn's  returned  by DbLog::put can later be
       used to retrieve records from the log.

  DbLog::open
       The DbLog::open  method  copies  a  pointer,  to  the  log
       identified  by the <B>directory</B> dir, into the memory location
       referenced by regionp.

       If the dbenv argument to DbLog::open was initialized using
       DbEnv::appinit,   dir   is  interpreted  as  described  by
       <B><A HREF="DbEnv.html">DbEnv(3)</A></B>.

       Otherwise, if dir is not NULL, it is interpreted  relative
       to  the  current working directory of the process.  If dir
       is NULL, the following environment variables  are  checked
       in  order:  ``TMPDIR'',  ``TEMP'', and ``TMP''.  If one of
       them is  set,  log  files  are  created  relative  to  the
       directory  it  specifies.   If  none  of them are set, the
       first possible one of the following directories  is  used:
       /var/tmp, /usr/tmp, /temp, /tmp, C:/temp and C:/tmp.

       All  files  associated  with  the  log are created in this
       directory.   This  directory  must  already   exist   when
       DbLog::open  is  called.   If  the log already exists, the
       process  must  have  permission  to  read  and  write  the
       existing  files.  If the log does not already exist, it is
       optionally created and initialized.

       If the log region is  being  created  and  log  files  are
       already  present,  the  log  files  are  ``recovered'' and
       subsequent log writes are appended to the end of the  log.

       The  log  is  stored in one or more files in the specified
       directory.  Each file is named using the format

            log.NNNNN

       where ``NNNNN'' is the sequence number of the file  within
       the log.

       The  flags  and  mode  arguments specify how files will be
       opened and/or created when they don't already exist.   The
       flags value is specified by <B>or</B>'ing together one or more of
       the following values:

       DB_CREATE
            Create any underlying files, as  necessary.   If  the
            files  do not already exist and the DB_CREATE flag is
            not specified, the call will fail.

       DB_THREAD
            Cause the DbLog handle returned  by  the  DbLog::open
            method  to  be  useable  by multiple threads within a
            single address space, i.e., to be  ``free-threaded''.

       All  files  created  by the log subsystem are created with
       mode mode (as described in <B>chmod(2)</B>) and modified  by  the
       process'   umask  value  at  the  time  of  creation  (see
       <B>umask(2)</B>).  The group ownership of created files is  based
       on  the  system and directory defaults, and is not further
       specified by DB.

       The logging subsystem is configured  based  on  which  set
       methods  have been used.  It is expected that applications
       will use a single DbEnv object as the argument to  all  of
       the subsystems in the DB package.  The fields of the DbEnv
       object  used  by  DbLog::open  are  described  below.   As
       references  to  the  DbEnv  object  may  be  maintained by
       DbLog::open, it is necessary that  the  DbEnv  object  and
       memory   it  references  be  valid  until  the  object  is
       destroyed.   Any  of  the  DbEnv  fields  that   are   not
       explicitly set will default to appropriate values.

       The   following   fields   in  the  DbEnv  object  may  be
       initialized, using  the  appropriate  set  method,  before
       calling DbLog::open:

       void *(*db_errcall)(char *db_errpfx, char *buffer);
       FILE *db_errfile;
       const char *db_errpfx;
       class ostream *db_error_stream;
       int db_verbose;
            The error fields of the DbEnv behave as described for
            <B><A HREF="DbEnv.html">DbEnv(3)</A></B>.

       u_int32_t lg_max;
            The maximum  size  of  a  single  file  in  the  log.
            Because   DbLsn  file  offsets  are  unsigned  4-byte
            values, lg_max may not be  larger  than  the  maximum
            unsigned 4-byte value.

            If lg_max is 0, a default value is used.

            See  the section "LOG FILE LIMITS" below, for further
            information.

       The DbLog::open method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or  returns
       the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLog::close
       The DbLog::close method closes the log associated with the
       DbLog object.

       In addition, if the dir argument to DbLog::open  was  NULL
       and  dbenv  was  not initialized using DbEnv::appinit, all
       files created for this shared region will be  removed,  as
       if DbLog::unlink were called.

       When   multiple   threads   are  using  the  DbLog  handle
       concurrently,  only  a  single   thread   may   call   the
       DbLog::close method.

       The DbLog::close method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or returns
       the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLog::flush
       The DbLog::flush method guarantees that  all  log  records
       whose  DbLsns  are less than or equal to the lsn parameter
       have been written to disk.  If lsn is NULL, all records in
       the log are flushed.

       The DbLog::flush method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or returns
       the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLog::get
       The DbLog::get method implements a cursor  inside  of  the
       log,  retrieving records from the log according to the lsn
       and flags parameters.

       The data field of the data object is  set  to  the  record
       retrieved and the size field indicates the number of bytes
       in the record.  See <B><A HREF="Dbt.html">Dbt(3)</A></B>  for  a  description  of  other
       fields  in  the  data  object.   <B>When</B> <B>multiple</B> <B>threads</B> <B>are</B>
       <B>using</B> <B>the</B> <B>returned</B> <B>DbLog</B> <B>handle</B> <B>concurrently,</B>  <B>either</B>  <B>the</B>

       <B>for</B> <B>any</B> <B>Dbt</B> <B>used</B> <B>for</B> <B>data</B> <B>retrieval.</B>

       The flags parameter must be set  to  exactly  one  of  the
       following values:

       DB_CHECKPOINT
            The  last  record written with the DB_CHECKPOINT flag
            specified to the DbLog::put method is returned in the
            data  argument.  The lsn argument is overwritten with
            the DbLsn of the record returned.  If no  record  has
            been  previously  written with the DB_CHECKPOINT flag
            specified, the first record in the log is returned.
            If the log is empty the DbLog::get method will return
            DB_NOTFOUND.

       DB_FIRST
            The  first  record from any of the log files found in
            the log directory is returned in the  data  argument.
            The lsn argument is overwritten with the DbLsn of the
            record returned.

            If the log is empty the DbLog::get method will return
            DB_NOTFOUND.

       DB_LAST
            The  last  record  in the log is returned in the data
            argument.  The lsn argument is overwritten  with  the
            DbLsn of the record returned.

            If  the  log  is  empty,  the  DbLog::get method will
            return DB_NOTFOUND.

       DB_NEXT
            The current log position  is  advanced  to  the  next
            record  in the log and that record is returned in the
            data argument.  The lsn argument is overwritten  with
            the DbLsn of the record returned.

            If the pointer has not been initialized via DB_FIRST,
            DB_LAST, DB_SET, DB_NEXT, or DB_PREV, DbLog::get will
            return  the first record in the log.  If the last log
            record has already been returned or the log is empty,
            the DbLog::get method will return DB_NOTFOUND.

            If  the  log  was opened with the DB_THREAD flag set,
            calls to DbLog::get with the DB_NEXT  flag  set  will
            return EINVAL.

       DB_PREV
            The  current  log  position  is moved to the previous
            record in the log and that record is returned in  the
            data  argument.  The lsn argument is overwritten with
            the DbLsn of the record returned.

            If the pointer has not been initialized via DB_FIRST,
            DB_LAST, DB_SET, DB_NEXT, or DB_PREV, DbLog::get will
            return the last record in the log.  If the first  log
            record has already been returned or the log is empty,
            the DbLog::get method will return DB_NOTFOUND.

            If the log was opened with the  DB_THREAD  flag  set,
            calls  to  DbLog::get  with the DB_PREV flag set will
            return EINVAL.

       DB_CURRENT
            Return the log record  currently  referenced  by  the
            log.

            If  the  log  pointer  has  not  been initialized via
            DB_FIRST, DB_LAST, DB_SET, DB_NEXT, or DB_PREV, or if
            the  log  was  opened  with  the  DB_THREAD flag set,
            DbLog::get will return EINVAL.

       DB_SET
            Retrieve the record specified by  the  lsn  argument.
            If  the  specified  DbLsn  is invalid (e.g., does not
            appear in the log) DbLog::get will return EINVAL.

       Otherwise, the DbLog::get method throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>
       or returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLog::compare
       The DbLog::compare method allows the caller to compare two
       DbLsn's.   DbLog::compare returns 0 if the two DbLsn's are
       equal, 1 if lsn0 is greater than lsn1, and -1 if  lsn0  is
       less than lsn1.

  DbLog::file
       The  DbLog::file  method  maps DbLsn's to file names.  The
       DbLog::file method copies the name of the file  containing
       the   record   named  by  lsn  into  the  memory  location
       referenced by namep.  (This mapping of DbLsn  to  file  is
       needed   for  database  administration.   For  example,  a
       transaction manager typically records the  earliest  DbLsn
       needed  for  restart,  and  the database administrator may
       want to archive log files to tape when they  contain  only
       DbLsn's before the earliest one needed for restart.)

       The  len  argument  is  the  length of the namep buffer in
       bytes.  If namep is too  short  to  hold  the  file  name,
       DbLog::file will return ENOMEM.  Note, as described above,
       log file names  are  quite  short,  on  the  order  of  10
       characters.

       The  DbLog::file method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or returns
       the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLog::put
       The DbLog::put method appends records  to  the  log.   The
       DbLsn  of the put record is returned in the lsn parameter.
       The flags parameter may be set to  one  of  the  following
       values:

       DB_CHECKPOINT
            The  log  should write a checkpoint record, recording
            any information necessary to make the log  structures
            recoverable after a crash.

       DB_CURLSN
            The  DB_LSN  of the next record to be put is returned
            in the lsn parameter.

       DB_FLUSH
            The log is  forced  to  disk  after  this  record  is
            written,  guaranteeing  that  all records with DbLsns
            less than or equal to the one being put are  on  disk
            before  this  method  returns  (this function is most
            often used for a transaction commit, see  Db::Txn  in
            Db (3)).

       The  caller  is  responsible  for  providing any necessary
       structure to data.  (For example, in a write-ahead logging
       protocol,  the  application  must  understand what part of
       data is an operation code, what part is redo  information,
       and  what  part  is  undo  information.  In addition, most
       transaction managers will store in data the DbLsn  of  the
       previous  log  record for the same transaction, to support
       chaining back through the transaction's log records during
       undo.)

       The  DbLog::put  method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or returns
       the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLog::unlink
       The  DbLog::unlink  method   destroys   the   log   region
       identified  by  the directory dir, removing all files used
       to implement the log region.  (The directory  dir  is  not
       removed.)    If  there  are  processes  that  have  called
       DbLog::open without calling DbLog::close (i.e., there  are
       processes  currently  using the log region), DbLog::unlink
       will fail without further action, unless the force flag is
       set,  in  which  case DbLog::unlink will attempt to remove
       the log region files regardless  of  any  processes  still
       using the log region.

       The  result  of  attempting to forcibly destroy the region
       when  a  process  has  the  region  open  is  unspecified.
       Processes  using  a  shared memory region maintain an open
       file descriptor for  it.   On  UNIX  systems,  the  region
       removal  should  succeed  and  processes that have already
       joined the region should continue to  run  in  the  region
       without  change,  however processes attempting to join the
       log region will either fail or attempt  to  create  a  new
       region.   On other systems, e.g., WNT, where the <B>unlink(2)</B>
       system call will fail if any  process  has  an  open  file
       descriptor for the file, the region removal will fail.

       In  the  case  of catastrophic or system failure, database
       recovery must  be  performed  (see  <B><A HREF="db_recover.html">db_recover(1)</A></B>  or  the
       DB_RECOVER      and      DB_RECOVER_FATAL     flags     to
       <B><A HREF="DbEnv.html">DbEnv::appinit(3)</A></B>).  Alternatively,  if  recovery  is  not
       required  because  no  database state is maintained across
       failures, it is possible to  clean  up  a  log  region  by
       removing  all  of  the files in the directory specified to
       the DbLog::open method, as  log  region  files  are  never
       created  in  any directory other than the one specified to
       DbLog::open.  Note, however, that this has  the  potential
       to remove files created by the other DB subsystems in this
       database environment.

       The  DbLog::unlink  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLog::archive
       The  DbLog::archive method creates a NULL-terminated array
       of log or database file names and copies a pointer to them
       into the user-specified memory location list.

       By default, DbLog::archive returns the names of all of the
       log files that are no  longer  in  use  (e.g.,  no  longer
       involved in active transactions), and that may be archived
       for  catastrophic  recovery  and  then  removed  from  the
       system.   If there were no file names to return, list will
       be set to NULL.

       Arrays of log file names are created in allocated  memory.
       If  db_malloc  is  non-NULL,  it is called to allocate the
       memory, otherwise, the library function <B>malloc(3)</B> is used.
       The  function db_malloc must match the calling conventions
       of the <B>malloc(3)</B> library routine.  Regardless, the  caller
       is  responsible  for deallocating the returned memory.  To
       deallocate the returned memory, free each returned  memory
       pointer;  pointers  inside  the  memory  do not need to be
       individually freed.

       The flags argument is specified by <B>or</B>'ing together one  or
       more of the following values:

       DB_ARCH_ABS
            All  pathnames  are  returned  as absolute pathnames,
            instead of relative to the database home directory.

       DB_ARCH_DATA
            Return the database files that need to be archived in
            order  to  recover  the  database  from  catastrophic
            failure.  If any of the database files have not  been
            accessed  during  the  lifetime  of  the  current log
            files, DbLog::archive will not include them  in  this
            list.   It  is  also  possible that some of the files
            referenced in the log have since  been  deleted  from
            the system.

       DB_ARCH_LOG
            Return  all  the log file names regardless of whether
            or not they are in use.

       The  DB_ARCH_DATA  and  DB_ARCH_LOG  flags  are   mutually
       exclusive.

       The  DbLog::archive  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

       The DbLog::archive method is based on  the  C  log_archive
       function,  which  is  the  underlying function used by the
       <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B>  utility.   See  the  source  code  for  the
       db_archive  utility for an example of using log_archive in
       a UNIX environment.  See the <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B> manual page for
       more information on database archival procedures.

  DbLog::db_register
       The  DbLog::db_register  method registers a file name with
       the log manager and copies a  file  identification  number
       into  the  memory  location referenced by fidp.  This file
       identification number should be used in all subsequent log
       messages  that  refer to operations on this file.  The log
       manager records  all  file  name  to  file  identification
       number  mappings  at  each  checkpoint  so that a recovery
       process can identify the file to which a record in the log
       refers.

       The  DbLog::db_register  method  is  called when an access
       method registers the open of a file.   The  dbp  parameter
       should  be  a  pointer  to  the  Db  object which is being
       returned by the access method.

       The type parameter should be one of the Db types specified
       in Db::open (<B><A HREF="seeDb.html">seeDb(3)</A></B>), e.g., DB_HASH.

       The  DbLog::db_register  method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLog::db_unregister
       The DbLog::db_unregister  method  disassociates  the  file
       name  to  file  identification number mapping for the file
       identification number specified by the fid parameter.  The
       file identification number may then be reused.

       The DbLog::db_unregister method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLog::stat
       The DbLog::stat function creates a  statistical  structure
       and  copies a pointer to it into the user-specified memory
       location.

       Statistical structures are created  in  allocated  memory.
       If  db_malloc  is  non-NULL,  it is called to allocate the
       memory, otherwise, the library function <B>malloc(3)</B> is used.
       The  function db_malloc must match the calling conventions
       of the <B>malloc(3)</B> library routine.  Regardless, the  caller
       is  responsible  for deallocating the returned memory.  To
       deallocate the returned memory, free each returned  memory
       pointer;  pointers  inside  the  memory  do not need to be
       individually freed.  The log statistics are  stored  in  a
       structure  of type DB_LOG_STAT (typedef'd in &lt;db.h&gt;).  The
       following DB_LOG_STAT fields will be filled in:

       u_int32_t st_magic;
            The magic number that identifies  a  file  as  a  log
            file.
       u_int32_t st_version;
            The version of the log file type.
       u_int32_t st_refcnt;
            The number of references to the region.
       u_int32_t st_regsize;
            The size of the region.
       u_int32_t st_mode;
            The mode of any created log files.
       u_int32_t st_lg_max;
            The  maximum  size  of any individual file comprising
            the log.
       u_int32_t st_written;
            The total number of bytes written to this log.
       u_int32_t st_written_chkpt;
            The  number  of  bytes   written   since   the   last
            checkpoint.
       u_int32_t st_region_wait;
            The number of times that a process was able to obtain
            the region lock without waiting.
       u_int32_t st_region_nowait;
            The number of times that a process was forced to wait
            before obtaining the region lock.

<H2>LOG FILE LIMITS</H2><PRE>
       Log file sizes impose a time limit on the length of time a
       database may be  accessed  under  transaction  protection,
       before  it needs to be dumped and reloaded (see <B><A HREF="db_dump.html">db_dump(3)</A></B>
       and   <B><A HREF="db_load.html">db_load(3)</A></B>).    Unfortunately,   the   limits    are
       potentially difficult to calculate.

       The log file name consists of "log." followed by 5 digits,
       resulting in a maximum of 99,999 log files.   Consider  an
       application performing 600 transactions per second, for 15
       hours a day,  logged  into  10Mb  log  files,  where  each
       transaction  is  logging  approximately 100 bytes of data.
       The calculation:

              (10 * 2^20 * 99999) /
                   (600 * 60 * 60 * 15 * 100) = 323.63

       indicates that the system will run out of log  file  space
       in  roughly  324 days.  If we increase the maximum size of
       the  files  from  10Mb  to  100Mb,  the  same  calculation
       indicates  that  the  application will run out of log file
       space in roughly 9 years.

       There is no way to  reset  the  log  file  name  space  in
       Berkeley  DB.   If your application is reaching the end of
       its log file name space, you should:

       1.   Archive  your  databases  as  if   to   prepare   for
            catastrophic  failure  (see  <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B>  for  more
            information).

       2.   Dump and re-load <B>all</B> your databases  (see  <B><A HREF="db_dump.html">db_dump(1)</A></B>
            and <B><A HREF="db_load.html">db_load(1)</A></B> for more information).

       3.   Remove  all  of  the  log  files  from  the  database
            environment (see <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B> for more information).

       4.   Restart your applications.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of db_log:

       DB_HOME
            If the dbenv argument to DbLog::open was  initialized
            using  db_appinit,  the  environment variable DB_HOME
            may be used as the path of the database home for  the
            interpretation of the dir argument to DbLog::open, as
            described    in     <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></B>.      Specifically,
            DbLog::open  is  affected by the configuration string
            value of DB_LOG_DIR.

       TMPDIR
            If the dbenv argument to DbLog::open was NULL or  not
            initialized   using   db_appinit,   the   environment
            variable TMPDIR may be used as the directory in which
            to  create  the  log, as described in the DbLog::open
            section above.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       Methods marked as returning errno will, by default,  throw
       an exception that encapsulates the error information.  The
       default error behavior can be changed, see <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>.
