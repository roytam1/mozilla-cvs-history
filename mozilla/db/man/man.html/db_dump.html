<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  db_dump  utility  reads the database file db_file and
       writes it to the standard output using  a  portable  flat-
       text  format  understood  by  the <B><A HREF="db_load.html">db_load(1)</A></B> utility.  The
       argument db_file must be a  file  produced  using  the  DB
       library functions.

       The  db_dump185  utility is similar to the db_dump utility
       except that it reads databases in the format  used  by  DB
       versions 1.85 and 1.86.

       The options are as follows:

       <B>-d</B>   Dump  the  specified database in a format helpful for
            debugging the DB library routines.  <B>The</B> <B>output</B> <B>format</B>
            <B>of</B>  <B>the</B>  <B>-d</B>  <B>option</B>  <B>is</B>  <B>not</B> <B>standard</B> <B>and</B> <B>may</B> <B>change,</B>
            <B>without</B> <B>notice,</B> <B>between</B> <B>releases</B> <B>of</B> <B>the</B> <B>DB</B> <B>library.</B>

       <B>-f</B>   Write  to  the  specified  file  instead  of  to  the
            standard output.

       <B>-h</B>   Specify  a  home  directory  for the database.  As DB
            versions before 2.0 did not support the concept of  a
            database  ``home'',  db_dump185 does not support this
            option.

       <B>-p</B>   If characters in either the key  or  data  items  are
            printing  characters  (as defined by <B>isprint(3)</B>), use
            printing characters in file to represent them.   This
            option  permits users to use standard text editors to
            modify the contents of databases.

            Note, different systems may have different notions as
            to  what  characters  are ``printing'', and databases
            dumped  in  this  manner  may  be  less  portable  to
            external systems.

       Dumping and reloading hash databases that use user-defined
       hash functions will result in new databases that  use  the
       default  hash  function.   While  using  the  default hash
       function may not be optimal for the new database, it  will
       continue to work correctly.

       Dumping  and  reloading  btree  databases  that  use user-
       defined prefix or comparison functions will result in  new
       databases  that  use  the  default  prefix  and comparison
       functions.  <B>In</B> <B>this</B> <B>case,</B> <B>it</B>  <B>is</B>  <B>quite</B>  <B>likely</B>  <B>that</B>  <B>the</B>
       <B>database</B>  <B>will</B> <B>be</B> <B>damaged</B> <B>beyond</B> <B>repair</B> <B>permitting</B> <B>neither</B>
       <B>record</B> <B>storage</B> <B>or</B> <B>retrieval.</B>

       The only available workaround for either case is to modify
       the  sources  for  the  <B><A HREF="db_load.html">db_load(1)</A></B>  utility  to  load  the
       database using the correct  hash,  prefix  and  comparison
       functions.

       The db_dump185 utility may not be available on your system
       as it is not always installed when the  DB  libraries  and
       utilities  are  installed.   If you are unable to find it,
       see your system administrator for further information.

       The db_dump utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error
       occurs.  The db_dump185 utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0
       if an error occurs.


</PRE>
<H2>OUTPUT FORMATS</H2><PRE>
       There  are  two  output  formats  used  by   db_dump   and
       db_dump185.

       In  both output formats, the first few lines of the output
       contain  header  information  describing  the   underlying
       access  method, filesystem page size and other bookkeeping
       information.  This information is output in ``name=value''
       pairs, where ``name'' may be any of the keywords listed in
       the <B><A HREF="db_load.html">db_load(1)</A></B> manual page,  and  ``value''  will  be  its
       value.  While this header information can be edited before
       the database is reloaded, there is rarely any reason to do
       so,  as  all  of  this  information  can  be overridden by
       command-line arguments to db_load.

       Following the header information are  the  key/data  pairs
       from  the  database.   If  the database being dumped is of
       type <B>btree</B> or <B>hash</B>, the output will  be  paired  lines  of
       text,  where  the  first line of the pair is the key item,
       and the second line of the pair is its corresponding  data
       item.   If the database being dumped is of type <B>recno</B>, the
       output will be lines of text, where each  line  is  a  new
       data item for the database.

       If  the  <B>-p</B>  option  was  specified, each output line will
       consist of single characters representing  any  characters
       from  the  database  that were ``printing'', and backslash
       (``\'')  escaped  characters  for  any  that   were   not.
       Backslash  characters  appearing in the output mean one of
       two things: if the backslash  character  precedes  another
       backslash  character,  it  means  that a literal backslash
       character occurred in  the  key  or  data  item.   If  the
       backslash character precedes any other character, the next
       two  characters  should  be  interpreted  as   hexadecimal
       specification  of  a  single character, e.g., ``\0a'' is a
       newline character in the ASCII character set.

       If the <B>-p</B> option was not specified, each output line  will
       consist  of  paired  hexadecimal  values,  e.g.,  the line
       ``726f6f74'' is the string ``root'' in the ASCII character
       set.

       In  both  output  formats, a single newline character ends
       both the key and data items.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       The following environment variables affect  the  execution
       of db_dump:

       DB_HOME
            If the <B>-h</B> option is not specified and the environment
            variable DB_HOME is set, it is used as  the  path  of
            the database home, as described in <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></B>.

       The  DB  library  is  a family of groups of functions that
       provides a modular programming interface  to  transactions
       and  record-oriented  file  access.   The library includes
       support for transactions, locking, logging and  file  page
       caching,  as well as various indexed access methods.  Many
       of the functional groups  (e.g.,  the  file  page  caching
       functions)   are   useful  independent  of  the  other  DB
       functions, although some functional groups are  explicitly
       based  on  other functional groups (e.g., transactions and
       logging).  For a general description of  the  DB  package,
       see <B><A HREF="db_intro.html">db_intro(3)</A></B>.
