<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  DB  library  is  a  family of classes that provides a
       modular programming interface to transactions and  record-
       oriented  file  access.   The library includes support for
       transactions, locking, logging and file page  caching,  as
       well  as  various  indexed  access  methods.   Many of the
       classes (e.g., the file page  caching  class)  are  useful
       independent of the other DB classes, although some classes
       are explicitly based on other classes (e.g.,  transactions
       and  logging).   For  a  general  description  of  the  DB
       package, see <B><A HREF="db_intro.html">db_intro(3)</A></B>.

       This manual page describes the  specific  details  of  the
       memory pool interface.

       The  <B><A HREF="DbMpool.html">DbMpool(3)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="DbMpoolFile.html">DbMpoolFile(3)</A></B> classes are the library
       interface  intended  to  provide  general-purpose,   page-
       oriented  buffer  management  of one or more files.  While
       designed to work with the other Db classes, this class  is
       also  useful  for more general purposes.  The memory pools
       (DbMpool's) are referred to in  this  document  as  simply
       ``pools''.   Pools may be shared between processes.  Pools
       are usually  filled  by  pages  from  one  or  more  files
       (DbMpoolFile's).   Pages  in  the pool are replaced in LRU
       (least-recently-used) order, with each new page  replacing
       the   page  that  has  been  unused  the  longest.   Pages
       retrieved  from  the  pool  using   DbMpoolFile::get   are
       ``pinned''  in  the  pool,  by  default,  until  they  are
       returned to the pool's control using the  DbMpoolFile::put
       method.

  DbMpool::open
       The  DbMpool::open  method copies a pointer, to the memory
       pool identified by the  <B>directory</B>  dir,  into  the  memory
       location referenced by regionp.

       If  the  dbenv  argument  to DbMpool::open was initialized
       using DbEnv::appinit, dir is interpreted as  described  by
       <B><A HREF="DbEnv.html">DbEnv(3)</A></B>.

       Otherwise,  if dir is not NULL, it is interpreted relative
       to the current working directory of the process.   If  dir
       is  NULL,  the following environment variables are checked
       in order: ``TMPDIR'', ``TEMP'', and ``TMP''.   If  one  of
       them is set, memory pool files are created relative to the
       directory it specifies.  If none  of  them  are  set,  the
       first  possible  one of the following directories is used:
       /var/tmp, /usr/tmp, /temp, /tmp, C:/temp and C:/tmp.

       All files associated with the memory pool are  created  in
       this  directory.   This  directory must already exist when
       DbMpool::open is  called.   If  the  memory  pool  already
       exists, the process must have permission to read and write
       the existing files.  If the memory pool does  not  already
       exist, it is optionally created and initialized.

       The  flags  and  mode  arguments specify how files will be
       opened and/or created when they don't already exist.   The
       flags value is specified by <B>or</B>'ing together one or more of
       the following values:

       DB_CREATE
            Create any underlying files, as  necessary.   If  the
            files  do not already exist and the DB_CREATE flag is
            not specified, the call will fail.

       DB_MPOOL_PRIVATE
            Create a private MPOOL that is not  shared  with  any
            other  process  (although it may be shared with other
            threads).

       DB_NOMMAP
            Always copy files in this memory pool into the  local
            cache  instead  of  mapping  them into process memory
            (see the description of the mp_mmapsize field of  the
            DbEnv object for further information).

       DB_THREAD
            Cause    the   DbMpool   handle   returned   by   the
            DbMpool::open  method  to  be  useable  by   multiple
            threads  within  a  single address space, i.e., to be
            ``free-threaded''.

       All files created by the memory pool subsystem (other than
       files   created   by  the  memp_fopen  method,  which  are
       separately specified)  are  created  with  mode  mode  (as
       described  in <B>chmod(2)</B>) and modified by the process' umask
       value at the time of creation (see <B>umask(2)</B>).   The  group
       ownership  of  created  files  is  based on the system and
       directory defaults, and is not further specified by DB.

       The memory pool subsystem is configured based on which set
       methods  have been used.  It is expected that applications
       will use a single DbEnv object as the argument to  all  of
       the subsystems in the DB package.  The fields of the DbEnv
       object used by  DbMpool::open  are  described  below.   As
       references  to  the  DbEnv  object  may  be  maintained by
       DbMpool::open, it is necessary that the DbEnv  object  and
       memory   it  references  be  valid  until  the  object  is
       destroyed.   Any  of  the  DbEnv  fields  that   are   not
       explicitly set will default to appropriate values.

       The   following   fields   in  the  DbEnv  object  may  be
       initialized, using  the  appropriate  set  method,  before
       calling DbMpool::open:

       void *(*db_errcall)(char *db_errpfx, char *buffer);
       FILE *db_errfile;
       const char *db_errpfx;
       class ostream *db_error_stream;
       int db_verbose;
            The error fields of the DbEnv behave as described for
            <B><A HREF="DbEnv.html">DbEnv(3)</A></B>.

       size_t mp_mmapsize;
            Files that are opened read-only in the pool (and that
            satisfy a few other criteria) are, by default, mapped
            into the  process  address  space  instead  of  being
            copied  into  the  local  cache.   This can result in
            better-than-usual performance, as  available  virtual
            memory  is normally much larger than the local cache,
            and page faults are faster than page copying on  many
            systems.  However, in the presence of limited virtual
            memory it can cause resource starvation, and  in  the
            presence of large databases, it can result in immense
            process  sizes.   If  mp_mmapsize  is  non-zero,   it
            specifies the maximum file size, in bytes, for a file
            to be mapped into  the  process  address  space.   By
            default, it is set to 10Mb.

       size_t mp_size;
            The  suggested  size  of  the  pool,  in bytes.  This
            should be the size of the normal working data set  of
            the application, with some small amount of additional
            memory for unusual situations.   (Note,  the  working
            set  is  not the same as the number of simultaneously
            referenced pages, and should be quite a bit  larger!)
            The  default  cache  size  is  128K bytes (16 8K byte
            pages), and may not be less than 20K bytes.

       The  DbMpool::open  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbMpool::close
       The DbMpool::close method closes the pool indicated by the
       DbMpool object, as returned by DbMpool::open.  This method
       does not imply a call to DbMpoolFile::sync, but does imply
       a  call  to  DbMpoolFile::close  for  any  remaining  open
       DbMpoolFile  objects  returned to this process by calls to
       DbMpoolFile::open.

       In addition, if the dir argument to DbMpool::open was NULL
       and  dbenv  was  not initialized using DbEnv::appinit, all
       files created for this shared region will be  removed,  as
       if DbMpool::unlink were called.

       When   multiple  threads  are  using  the  DbMpool  handle
       concurrently,  only  a  single   thread   may   call   the
       DbMpool::close method.

       The  DbMpool::close  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbMpool::unlink
       The  DbMpool::unlink  method  destroys  the  memory   pool
       identified  by  the directory dir, removing all files used
       to implement the memory pool.  (The directory dir  is  not
       removed.)    If  there  are  processes  that  have  called
       DbMpool::open without calling DbMpool::close (i.e.,  there
       are   processes   currently   using   the   memory  pool),
       DbMpool::unlink will fail without further  action,  unless
       the  force flag is set, in which case DbMpool::unlink will
       attempt to remove the memory pool files regardless of  any
       processes still using the memory pool.

       The  result  of  attempting to forcibly destroy the region
       when  a  process  has  the  region  open  is  unspecified.
       Processes  using  a  shared memory region maintain an open
       file descriptor for  it.   On  UNIX  systems,  the  region
       removal  should  succeed  and  processes that have already
       joined the region should continue to  run  in  the  region
       without  change,  however processes attempting to join the
       memory pool will either fail or attempt to  create  a  new
       region.   On other systems, e.g., WNT, where the <B>unlink(2)</B>
       system call will fail if any  process  has  an  open  file
       descriptor for the file, the region removal will fail.
       In  the  case  of catastrophic or system failure, database
       recovery must  be  performed  (see  <B><A HREF="db_recover.html">db_recover(1)</A></B>  or  the
       DB_RECOVER      and      DB_RECOVER_FATAL     flags     to
       <B><A HREF="DbEnv.html">DbEnv::appinit(3)</A></B>).  Alternatively,  if  recovery  is  not
       required  because  no  database state is maintained across
       failures, it is possible to clean  up  a  memory  pool  by
       removing  all  of  the files in the directory specified to
       the DbMpool::open method, as memory pool files  are  never
       created  in  any directory other than the one specified to
       DbMpool::open.  Note, however, that this has the potential
       to remove files created by the other DB subsystems in this
       database environment.

       The DbMpool::unlink  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbMpool::db_register
       The  DbMpool::db_register  method  registers  page-in  and
       page-out  functions  for  files  of  type  ftype  in   the
       specified pool.

       If the pgin function is non-NULL, it is called each time a
       page is read into the memory pool  from  a  file  of  type
       ftype,  or a page is created for a file of type ftype (see
       the DB_MPOOL_CREATE flag for the DbMpoolFile::get method).
       If  the pgout function is non-NULL, it is called each time
       a page is written to a file of type ftype.

       Both the pgin and pgout functions are called with the page
       number,  a  pointer to the page being read or written, and
       any  argument  pgcookie  that   was   specified   to   the
       DbMpoolFile::open  method  when  the file was opened.  The
       pgin and pgout functions should return 0 on  success,  and
       an  applicable  non-zero  errno value on failure, in which
       case  the  DbMpool  method  calling  it  will  also  fail,
       returning that errno value.

       The  purpose  of  the  DbMpool::db_register  method  is to
       support processing when pages are entered into, or flushed
       from,  the pool.  A file type must be specified to make it
       possible for unrelated  threads  or  processes,  that  are
       sharing a pool, to evict each other's pages from the pool.
       Applications  should  call  DbMpool::db_register,   during
       initialization,  for  each type of file requiring input or
       output processing that  will  be  sharing  the  underlying
       pool.   (No  registry is necessary for the standard access
       method  types,  btree,  hash  and  recno,  as  <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db::open(3)</A></B>
       registers them separately.)

       If  a thread or process does not call DbMpool::db_register
       for a file type, it is impossible for it  to  evict  pages
       for any file requiring input or output processing from the
       pool.  For this reason, DbMpool::db_register should always
       be called by each application sharing a pool for each type
       of file included in the pool, regardless of whether or not
       the application itself uses files of that type.

       There  are  no  standard values for ftype, pgin, pgout and
       pgcookie, except that the ftype value for a file must be a
       non-zero positive number, as negative numbers are reserved
       for internal use by the  DB  library.   For  this  reason,
       applications  sharing  a pool must coordinate their values
       amongst themselves.

       The DbMpool::db_register method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbMpool::trickle
       The  DbMpool::trickle  method  ensures  that  at least pct
       percent of the pages in the shared memory pool  are  clean
       by  writing  dirty  pages  to their backing files.  If the
       nwrotep argument is non-NULL, the  number  of  pages  that
       were  written  to reach the correct percentage is returned
       in the memory location it references.

       The purpose of the DbMpool::trickle method is to enable  a
       memory  pool  manager  to  ensure  that  a  page is always
       available for reading in new information without having to
       wait for a write.

       The  DbMpool::trickle  method  throws  a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbMpool::sync
       The DbMpool::sync method ensures  that  all  the  modified
       pages  in  the  pool with log sequence numbers (LSNs) less
       than the lsn argument are written to disk.

       The  DbMpool::sync  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   or
       returns  the  value of errno on failure, 0 on success, and
       DB_INCOMPLETE if there were pages which need to be written
       but  which  DbMpool::sync was unable to write immediately.
       In addition, if DbMpool::sync returns success,  the  value
       of  lsn  will be overwritten with the largest LSN from any
       page which was written by DbMpool::sync  to  satisfy  this
       request.

       The  purpose  of  the  DbMpool::sync method is to enable a
       transaction manager to ensure, as part  of  a  checkpoint,
       that  all  pages  modified  by  a  certain  time have been
       written to disk.   Pages  in  the  pool  which  cannot  be
       written  back  to  disk  immediately  (e.g., are currently
       pinned) are written to disk as soon as it is  possible  to
       do  so.   The expected behavior of the transaction manager
       is to call the  DbMpool::sync  method  and  then,  if  the
       return  indicates  that  some  pages  could not be written
       immediately, to wait briefly and retry again with the same
       LSN  until the DbMpool::sync method returns that all pages
       have been written.

       To  support  the  DbMpool::sync   functionality,   it   is
       necessary  that  the pool methods know the location of the
       LSN on the page for each file type.  This location  should
       be   specified   when   the   file  is  opened  using  the
       DbMpoolFile::open method.  (Note, it is not required  that
       the LSN be aligned on the page in any way.)

  DbMpool::stat

       The  DbMpool::stat  method  creates statistical structures
       and copies pointers to  them  into  user-specified  memory
       locations.   The  statistics  include  the number of files
       participating in the pool, the active pages in  the  pool,
       and information as to how effective the cache has been.

       Statistical  structures  are  created in allocated memory.
       If db_malloc is non-NULL, it is  called  to  allocate  the
       memory, otherwise, the library function <B>malloc(3)</B> is used.
       The function db_malloc must match the calling  conventions
       of  the <B>malloc(3)</B> library routine.  Regardless, the caller
       is responsible for deallocating the returned  memory.   To
       deallocate  the returned memory, free each returned memory
       pointer; pointers inside the memory  do  not  need  to  be
       individually freed.

       If  gsp  is non-NULL, the global statistics for the memory
       pool  object  are  copied  into  the  memory  location  it
       references.    The  global  statistics  are  stored  in  a
       structure of type DB_MPOOL_STAT (typedef'd in &lt;db_cxx.h&gt;).

       The following DB_MPOOL_STAT fields will be filled in:

       u_int32_t st_refcnt;
            The number of references to the region.
       u_int32_t st_regsize;
            The size of the region.
       size_t st_cachesize;
             Cache size in bytes.
       u_int32_t st_cache_hit;
            Requested pages found in the cache.
       u_int32_t st_cache_miss;
            Requested pages not found in the cache.
       u_int32_t st_map;
            Requested  pages  mapped  into  the  process' address
            space  (there  is  no  available  information  as  to
            whether or not this request caused disk I/O, although
            examining the application  page  fault  rate  may  be
            helpful).
       u_int32_t st_page_create;
            Pages created in the cache.
       u_int32_t st_page_in;
            Pages read into the cache.

       u_int32_t st_page_out;
            Pages written from the cache to the backing file.
       u_int32_t st_ro_evict;
            Clean pages forced from the cache.
       u_int32_t st_rw_evict;
            Dirty pages forced from the cache.
       u_int32_t st_hash_buckets;
            Number of hash buckets in buffer hash table.
       u_int32_t st_hash_searches;
            Total number of buffer hash table lookups.
       u_int32_t st_hash_longest;
            The  longest  chain  ever  encountered in buffer hash
            table lookups.
       u_int32_t st_hash_examined;
            Total number of hash elements traversed  during  hash
            table lookups.
       u_int32_t st_page_clean;
            Clean pages currently in the cache.
       u_int32_t st_page_dirty;
            Dirty pages currently in the cache.
       u_int32_t st_page_trickle;
            Dirty pages written using the memp_trickle interface.

       If  fsp  is  non-NULL,  a  pointer  to  a  NULL-terminated
       variable  length  array of statistics for individual files
       in the memory pool is copied into the memory  location  it
       references.  If no individual files currently exist in the
       memory pool, fsp will be set to NULL.

       The per-file statistics are stored in structures  of  type
       DB_MPOOL_FSTAT  (typedef'd  in &lt;db_cxx.h&gt;).  The following
       DB_MPOOL_FSTAT fields will be filled in for each  file  in
       the pool, i.e., each element of the array:

       char *file_name;
            The name of the file.
       size_t st_pagesize;
             Page size in bytes.
       u_int32_t st_cache_hit;
            Requested pages found in the cache.
       u_int32_t st_cache_miss;
            Requested pages not found in the cache.
       u_int32_t st_map;
            Requested  pages  mapped  into  the  process' address
            space.
       u_int32_t st_page_create;
            Pages created in the cache.
       u_int32_t st_page_in;
            Pages read into the cache.
       u_int32_t st_page_out;
            Pages written from the cache to the backing file.

       The  DbMpool::stat  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       The following environment variables affect the behavior of
       DbMpoolFile:

       DB_HOME
            If  the   dbenv   argument   to   DbMpool::open   was
            initialized   using   db_appinit,   the   environment
            variable DB_HOME may be  used  as  the  path  of  the
            database  home  for  the  interpretation  of  the dir
            argument   to   DbMpool::open,   as   described    in
            <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></B>.

       TMPDIR
            If  the  dbenv  argument to DbMpool::open was NULL or
            not initialized  using  db_appinit,  the  environment
            variable TMPDIR may be used as the directory in which
            to create  the  memory  pool,  as  described  in  the
            DbMpool::open section above.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       Methods  marked as returning errno will, by default, throw
       an exception that encapsulates the error information.  The
       default error behavior can be changed, see <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>.

       The  DbMpool::open   method   may   fail   and   throw   a
       <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>

       or  return  errno  for any of the errors specified for the
       following DB and library functions: <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">DBmemp-&gt;pgin(3)</A></B>,
       <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">DBmemp-&gt;pgout(3)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="DbLog.html">DbLog::compare(3)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="DbLog.html">DbLog::flush(3)</A></B>,
