<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The   db_stat   utility   displays   statistics   for   DB
       environments.

       The options are as follows:

       <B>-C</B>   Display internal information about the  lock  region.
            (The output from this option is often both voluminous
            and meaningless, and is intended only for debugging.)

            <B>-A</B>   Display all information.
            <B>-c</B>   Display lock conflict matrix.
            <B>-f</B>   Display lock and object free lists.
            <B>-l</B>   Display lockers within hash chains.
            <B>-m</B>   Display region memory information.
            <B>-o</B>   Display objects within hash chains.

       <B>-c</B>   Display   lock  region  statistics  as  described  in
            <B><A HREF="db_lock.html">db_lock(3)</A></B>.

       <B>-d</B>   Display  database  statistics   for   the   specified
            database, as described in <B><A HREF="db_open.html">db_open(3)</A></B>.

       <B>-h</B>   Specify a home directory for the database.

       <B>-l</B>   Display   log   region  statistics  as  described  in
            <B><A HREF="db_log.html">db_log(3)</A></B>.

       <B>-M</B>   Display internal information about the shared  memory
            buffer  pool.   (The output from this option is often
            both voluminous and meaningless, and is intended only
            for debugging.)

            <B>-A</B>   Display all information.
            <B>-h</B>   Display buffers within hash chains.
            <B>-l</B>   Display buffers within LRU chains.
            <B>-m</B>   Display region memory information.

       <B>-m</B>   Display  shared  memory  buffer  pool  statistics  as
            described in <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">db_mpool(3)</A></B>.

       <B>-N</B>   Don't acquire locks while displaying the  statistics.
            This  option  is  intended only for debugging corrupt
            regions and  should  not  be  used  under  any  other
            circumstances.

       <B>-t</B>   Display transaction region statistics as described in
            <B><A HREF="db_txn.html">db_txn(3)</A></B>.

       The db_stat utility attaches to DB shared memory  regions.
       In  order  to avoid region corruption, it should always be
       given the chance to detach and exit gracefully.  To  cause
       db_stat  to  clean  up  after  itself and exit, send it an
       interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       Values smaller than 10  million  are  generally  displayed
       without  any  special  notation.   Values  larger  than 10
       million are normally displayed as ``&lt;number&gt;M''.

       The db_stat utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an error
       occurs.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of db_stat:

       DB_HOME
            If the <B>-h</B> option is not specified and the environment
            variable  DB_HOME  is  set, it is used as the path of
            the database home, as described in <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></B>.

<H2>SEE ALSO</H2><PRE>
       The DB library is a family of  groups  of  functions  that
       provides  a  modular programming interface to transactions
       and record-oriented file  access.   The  library  includes
       support  for  transactions, locking, logging and file page
       caching, as well as various indexed access methods.   Many
       of  the  functional  groups  (e.g.,  the file page caching
       functions)  are  useful  independent  of  the   other   DB
       functions,  although some functional groups are explicitly
       based on other functional groups (e.g.,  transactions  and
       logging).   For  a  general description of the DB package,
