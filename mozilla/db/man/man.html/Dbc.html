<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  DB  library  is  a  family of classes that provides a
       modular programming interface to transactions and  record-
       oriented  file  access.   The library includes support for
       transactions, locking, logging and file page  caching,  as
       well  as  various  indexed  access  methods.   Many of the
       classes (e.g., the file page  caching  class)  are  useful
       independent of the other DB classes, although some classes
       are explicitly based on other classes (e.g.,  transactions
       and  logging).   For  a  general  description  of  the  DB
       package, see <B><A HREF="db_intro.html">db_intro(3)</A></B>.

       This manual page describes the  specific  details  of  the
       cursor support for the access methods in <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db(3)</A></B>.

       The  Dbc  functions  are  the library interface supporting
       sequential access to the  records  stored  by  the  access
       methods of the Db library.  Cursors are created by calling
       Db::cursor method described  in  <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db(3)</A></B>,  which  returns  a
       pointer to a Dbc object.

       Each cursor maintains positioning information within a set
       of key/data  pairs.   In  the  presence  of  transactions,
       cursors  are  only  valid  within  the context of a single
       transaction, the one specified during the Db::cursor  call
       described   in  <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db(3)</A></B>.   All  cursor  operations  will  be
       executed in  the  context  of  that  transaction.   Before
       aborting  or  committing  a  transaction, all cursors used
       within that transaction must be closed.  In  the  presence
       of transactions, the application must call DbTxn::abort if
       any of the  cursor  operations  returns  that  a  deadlock
       (EAGAIN) or system failure occurred.

       When  locking  is enabled, page locks are retained between
       consecutive  cursor  calls.   For  this  reason,  in   the
       presence  of  locking, applications should discard cursors
       as soon as they are done with them.  Calling the Db::close
       method  (see  <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db(3)</A></B>)  discards  any  cursors opened in the
       context of a particular Db object returned by the Db::open
       call.
       The methods of the Dbc are defined as follows:

       int Dbc::close();
            A  method  that  discards  the  cursor.   No  further
            references to the Dbc object should be made.

            The Dbc::close  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or
            returns  the  value  of  errno  on  failure  and 0 on
            success.

       int Dbc::del(u_int32_t flags);
            A method that deletes  the  key/data  pair  currently
            referenced by the cursor.

            The  flags parameter is currently unused, and must be
            set to 0.

            The cursor position is unchanged after a  delete  and
            subsequent  calls  to  cursor functions expecting the
            cursor to reference an existing key will fail.

            The  Dbc::del  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   or
            returns  the value of errno on failure, 0 on success,
            and DB_KEYEMPTY  if  the  element  has  already  been
            deleted.

       int Dbc::get(Dbt *key, Dbt *data, u_int32_t flags);
            A  method  that  retrieves  key/data  pairs  from the
            database.  The address and  length  of  the  key  are
            returned  in the object referenced by key (except for
            the case of the DB_SET flag where the key  object  is
            unchanged),  and  the  address and length of the data
            are returned in the object referenced by data.

            Modifications to the  database  during  a  sequential
            scan  will  be  reflected  in  the scan, i.e. records
            inserted behind a cursor will not be  returned  while
            records  inserted  in  front  of  a  cursor  will  be
            returned.

            In recno databases, missing  entries  (i.e.,  entries
            that  were  never  explicitly  created  or  that were
            created and then deleted), will be skipped  during  a
            sequential scan.

            If  multiple  threads  or processes insert items into
            the same database file  without  using  locking,  the
            results  are  undefined.   For  more  detail, see the
            section below on cursor stability.

            The parameter flags must be set to exactly one of the
            following values:

            DB_FIRST
                 The   cursor  is  set  to  reference  the  first
                 key/data pair of the database, and that pair  is
                 returned.   In  the  presence  of  duplicate key
                 values, the  first  data  item  in  the  set  of
                 duplicates is returned.

                 If  the  database  is empty, the Dbc::get method
                 will return DB_NOTFOUND.

            DB_LAST
                 The cursor is set to reference the last key/data
                 pair of the database, and that pair is returned.
                 In the presence of  duplicate  key  values,  the
                 last  data  item  in  the  set  of duplicates is
                 returned.

                 If the database is empty,  the  Dbc::get  method
                 will return DB_NOTFOUND.

            DB_NEXT
                 If the cursor is not yet initialized, DB_NEXT is
                 identical to DB_FIRST.

                 Otherwise, move the cursor to the next  key/data
                 pair of the database, and that pair is returned.
                 In the presence of  duplicate  key  values,  the
                 value of the key may not change.

                 If  the  cursor is already on the last record in
                 the database, the Dbc::get  method  will  return
                 DB_NOTFOUND.

            DB_PREV
                 If the cursor is not yet initialized, DB_PREV is
                 identical to DB_LAST.

                 Otherwise,  move  the  cursor  to  the  previous
                 key/data  pair of the database, and that pair is
                 returned.  In  the  presence  of  duplicate  key
                 values, the value of the key may not change.

                 If  the cursor is already on the first record in
                 the database, the Dbc::get  method  will  return
                 DB_NOTFOUND.

            DB_CURRENT
                 Return the key/data pair currently referenced by
                 the cursor.

                 If the cursor key/data pair  has  been  deleted,
                 the Dbc::get method will return DB_KEYEMPTY.

                 If  the  cursor  is  not  yet  initialized,  the
                 Dbc::get method will return EINVAL.

            DB_SET
                 Move the cursor to the specified  key/data  pair
                 of the database, and return the datum associated
                 with the given key.

                 In  the  presence  of  duplicate   key   values,
                 Dbc::get will return the first data item for the
                 given key.

                 If the database is  a  recno  database  and  the
                 requested  key  exists, but was never explicitly
                 created by the application or was later deleted,
                 the Dbc::get method returns DB_KEYEMPTY.

                 If  no  matching  keys  are  found, the Dbc::get
                 method will return DB_NOTFOUND.

            DB_SET_RANGE
                 The DB_SET_RANGE flag is identical to the DB_SET
                 flag, except that the key is returned as well as
                 the data item, and, in the  case  of  the  btree
                 access method, the returned key/data pair is the
                 smallest  key  greater  than  or  equal  to  the
                 specified  key  (as determined by the comparison
                 function), permitting partial  key  matches  and
                 range searches.

            DB_SET_RECNO
                 Move  the cursor to the specific numbered record
                 of  the  database,  and  return  the  associated
                 key/data  pair.  The data field of the specified
                 key must be a pointer to a memory location  from
                 which  a db_recno_t may be read, as described in
                 <B><A HREF="Dbt.html">Dbt(3)</A></B>.  This memory location will  be  read  to
                 determine the record to be retrieved.

                 For DB_SET_RECNO to be specified, the underlying
                 database must be of type btree and it must  have
                 been   created  with  the  DB_RECNUM  flag  (see
                 Db::open in <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db(3)</A></B>).

            DB_GET_RECNO
                 Return the record  number  associated  with  the
                 cursor.   The  record number will be returned in
                 the data Dbt as described in  <B><A HREF="Dbt.html">Dbt(3)</A></B>.   The  key
                 parameter is ignored.

                 For DB_GET_RECNO to be specified, the underlying
                 database must be of type btree and it must  have
                 been   created  with  the  DB_RECNUM  flag  (see
                 Db::open in <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db(3)</A></B>).

            Otherwise,   the    Dbc::get    method    throws    a
            <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or  returns  the  value  of  errno on
            failure and 0 on success.

            If Dbc::get fails for any reason, the  state  of  the
            cursor will be unchanged.

       int Dbc::put(Dbt *key, Dbt *data, u_int32_t flags);
              A  method  that  stores  key/data  pairs  into  the
            database.

            The flags parameter must be set to exactly one of the
            following values:

            DB_AFTER
                 In  the  case  of  the  btree  and  hash  access
                 methods, insert the data element as a  duplicate
                 element  of  the  key  referenced by the cursor.
                 The new element appears  immediately  after  the
                 current  cursor  position.   It  is  an error to
                 specify DB_AFTER if the underlying btree or hash
                 database  was  not created with the DB_DUP flag.
                 The key parameter is ignored.

                 In the case of the recno access method, it is an
                 error  to  specify  DB_AFTER  if  the underlying
                 recno  database  was  not   created   with   the
                 DB_RENUMBER  flag.   If the DB_RENUMBER flag was
                 specified, a new key  is  created,  all  records
                 after   the   inserted  item  are  automatically
                 renumbered, and the key of  the  new  record  is
                 returned   in   the  object  referenced  by  the
                 parameter key.  The initial  value  of  the  key
                 parameter is ignored.  See Db::open in <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db(3)</A></B> for
                 more information.

                 If  the  cursor  is  not  yet  initialized,  the
                 Dbc::put method will return EINVAL.

            DB_BEFORE
                 In  the  case  of  the  btree  and  hash  access
                 methods, insert the data element as a  duplicate
                 element  of  the  key  referenced by the cursor.
                 The new element appears immediately  before  the
                 current  cursor  position.   It  is  an error to
                 specify DB_BEFORE if  the  underlying  btree  or
                 hash  database  was  not created with the DB_DUP
                 flag.  The key parameter is ignored.

                 In the case of the recno access method, it is an
                 error  to  specify  DB_BEFORE  if the underlying
                 recno  database  was  not   created   with   the
                 DB_RENUMBER  flag.   If the DB_RENUMBER flag was
                 specified, a new key  is  created,  the  current
                 record    and   all   records   after   it   are
                 automatically renumbered, and the key of the new
                 record  is  returned in the object referenced by
                 the parameter key.  The initial value of the key
                 parameter is ignored.  See Db::open in <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db(3)</A></B> for
                 more information.

                 If  the  cursor  is  not  yet  initialized,  the
                 Dbc::put method will return EINVAL.

            DB_CURRENT
                 Overwrite   the   data   of  the  key/data  pair
                 referenced by the cursor with the specified data
                 item.

                 The key parameter is ignored.

                 If  the  cursor  is  not  yet  initialized,  the
                 Dbc::put method will return EINVAL.

            DB_KEYFIRST
                 In  the  case  of  the  btree  and  hash  access
                 methods, insert the specified key/data pair into
                 the database.  If the key already exists in  the
                 database, the inserted data item is added as the
                 first of the data items for that key.

                 The DB_KEYFIRST flag may not be specified to the
                 recno access method.

            DB_KEYLAST
                 Insert  the  specified  key/data  pair  into the
                 database.  If the  key  already  exists  in  the
                 database, the inserted data item is added as the
                 last of the data items for that key.

                 The DB_KEYLAST flag may not be specified to  the
                 recno access method.

            If  the  cursor record has been deleted, the Dbc::put
            method will return DB_KEYEMPTY.
            Otherwise,   the    Dbc::put    method    throws    a
            <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or  returns  the  value  of  errno on
            failure and 0 on success.

            If Dbc::put fails for any reason, the  state  of  the
            cursor  will  be unchanged.  If Dbc::put succeeds and
            an item is inserted into the database, the cursor  is
            always  positioned  to  reference  the newly inserted
            item.


</PRE>
<H2>CURSOR STABILITY</H2><PRE>
       In the absence of locking, no guarantees  are  made  about
       the   stability  of  cursors  in  different  processes  or
       threads.  However, the  btree  and  recno  access  methods
       guarantee  that cursor operations, interspersed with other
       cursor or non-cursor operations  in  the  same  thread  of
       control  (i.e.,  thread  or single-threaded process), will
       always return keys in order  and  will  return  each  non-
       deleted  key/data  pair  exactly  once.   Because the hash
       access method uses a dynamic hashing algorithm, it  cannot
       guarantee any form of stability in the presence of inserts
       and deletes unless locking is performed.

       If locking was specified when the Db file was opened,  but
       transactions are not in effect, the access methods provide
       repeatable reads with respect to the cursor.  That  is,  a
       DB_CURRENT  call on the cursor is guaranteed to return the
       same record as was  returned  on  the  last  call  to  the
       cursor.

       In  the  presence of transactions, the access method calls
       between DbTxnMgr::begin and DbTxn::abort or  DbTxn::commit
       provide  degree  3 consistency.  For all access methods, a
       cursor scan of the database performed within  the  context
       of  a  transaction  is  guaranteed to return each key/data
       pair once and only once, except  in  the  following  case.
       If,  while  performing a cursor scan using the hash access
       method, the transaction performing the scan inserts a  new
       pair  into  the  database,  it  is possible that duplicate
       key/data pairs will be returned.


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       Methods marked as returning errno will, by default,  throw
       an exception that encapsulates the error information.  The
       default error behavior can be changed, see <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>.

       The Dbc::close method may fail and throw a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>

       or  return  errno  for any of the errors specified for the
       following DB and library functions: <B><A HREF="DbLock.html">DbLock::get(3)</A></B>,
