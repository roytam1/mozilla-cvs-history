<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The   db_checkpoint  utility  is  a  daemon  process  that
       monitors  the  database   log   and   periodically   calls
       <B><A HREF="db_txn.html">txn_checkpoint(3)</A></B> to checkpoint it.

       The options are as follows:

       <B>-1</B>   Checkpoint the log once, and then exit.

       <B>-h</B>   Specify a home directory for the database.

       <B>-k</B>   Checkpoint  the  database  at least as often as every
            kbytes of log file are written.

       <B>-L</B>   Log the execution of the db_checkpoint utility to the
            specified file in the following format, where ``###''
            is the process ID, and  the  date  is  the  time  the
            utility starting running.

            db_checkpoint: ### Wed Jun 15 01:23:45 EDT 1995

            This  file  will  be  removed  if  the  db_checkpoint
            utility exits gracefully.

       <B>-p</B>   Checkpoint the database at least every min minutes.

       <B>-v</B>   Write the time of each  checkpoint  to  the  standard
            output.

       At  least  one  of  the  <B>-1</B>,  <B>-k</B>  and  <B>-p</B>  options must be
       specified.

       The db_checkpoint utility attaches  to  DB  shared  memory
       regions.   In  order to avoid region corruption, it should
       always be given the chance to detach and exit  gracefully.
       To  cause db_checkpoint to clean up after itself and exit,
       send it an interrupt signal (SIGINT).

       The db_checkpoint utility exits 0 on success, and &gt;0 if an
       error occurs.

<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       The  following  environment variables affect the execution
       of db_checkpoint:

       DB_HOME
            If the <B>-h</B> option is not specified and the environment
            variable  DB_HOME  is  set, it is used as the path of
            the database home, as described in <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></B>.

<H2>SEE ALSO</H2><PRE>
       The DB library is a family of  groups  of  functions  that
       provides  a  modular programming interface to transactions
       and record-oriented file  access.   The  library  includes
       support  for  transactions, locking, logging and file page
       caching, as well as various indexed access methods.   Many
       of  the  functional  groups  (e.g.,  the file page caching
       functions)  are  useful  independent  of  the   other   DB
       functions,  although some functional groups are explicitly
       based on other functional groups (e.g.,  transactions  and
       logging).   For  a  general description of the DB package,
       see <B><A HREF="db_intro.html">db_intro(3)</A></B>.
