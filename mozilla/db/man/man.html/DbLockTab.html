<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  DB  library  is  a  family of classes that provides a
       modular programming interface to transactions and  record-
       oriented  file  access.   The library includes support for
       transactions, locking, logging and file page  caching,  as
       well  as  various  indexed  access  methods.   Many of the
       classes (e.g., the file page  caching  class)  are  useful
       independent of the other DB classes, although some classes
       are explicitly based on other classes (e.g.,  transactions
       and  logging).   For  a  general  description  of  the  DB
       package, see <B><A HREF="db_intro.html">db_intro(3)</A></B>.

       This manual page describes the  specific  details  of  the
       locking interface.

       The DbLockTab class is intended to provide general-purpose
       locking.   While  designed  to  work  with  the  other  Db
       classes,  this  class  is  also  useful  for  more general
       locking purposes.  Locks can be shared between  processes.
       In most cases, when multiple treads or processes are using
       locking, the deadlock detector, <B><A HREF="db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock(1)</A></B>, should  be
       run.

  DbLockTab::open
       The  DbLockTab::open  method copies a pointer, to the lock
       table identified by the <B>directory</B>  dir,  into  the  memory
       location referenced by regionp.

       If  the  dbenv argument to DbLockTab::open was initialized
       using DbEnv::appinit, dir is interpreted as  described  by
       <B><A HREF="DbEnv.html">DbEnv(3)</A></B>.

       Otherwise,  if dir is not NULL, it is interpreted relative
       to the current working directory of the process.   If  dir
       is  NULL,  the following environment variables are checked
       in order: ``TMPDIR'', ``TEMP'', and ``TMP''.   If  one  of
       them  is set, lock table files are created relative to the
       directory it specifies.  If none  of  them  are  set,  the
       first  possible  one of the following directories is used:
       /var/tmp, /usr/tmp, /temp, /tmp, C:/temp and C:/tmp.

       All files associated with the lock table  are  created  in
       this  directory.   This  directory must already exist when
       DbLockTab::open is called.   If  the  lock  table  already
       exists, the process must have permission to read and write
       the existing files.  If the lock table  does  not  already
       exist, it is optionally created and initialized.

       The  flags  and  mode  arguments specify how files will be
       opened and/or created when they don't already exist.   The
       flags value is specified by <B>or</B>'ing together one or more of
       the following values:

       DB_CREATE
            Create any underlying files, as  necessary.   If  the
            files  do not already exist and the DB_CREATE flag is
            not specified, the call will fail.

       DB_THREAD
            Cause  the   DbLockTab   handle   returned   by   the
            DbLockTab::open  method  to  be  useable  by multiple
            threads within a single address space,  i.e.,  to  be
            ``free-threaded''.

       All  files  created by the lock subsystem are created with
       mode mode (as described in <B>chmod(2)</B>) and modified  by  the
       process'   umask  value  at  the  time  of  creation  (see
       <B>umask(2)</B>).  The group ownership of created files is  based
       on  the  system and directory defaults, and is not further
       specified by DB.

       The locking subsystem is configured  based  on  which  set
       methods  have been used.  It is expected that applications
       will use a single DbEnv object as the argument to  all  of
       the subsystems in the DB package.  The fields of the DbEnv
       object used by DbLockTab::open are  described  below.   As
       references  to  the  DbEnv  object  may  be  maintained by
       DbLockTab::open, it is necessary that the DbEnv object and
       memory   it  references  be  valid  until  the  object  is
       destroyed.   Any  of  the  DbEnv  fields  that   are   not
       explicitly set will default to appropriate values.
       The   following   fields   in  the  DbEnv  object  may  be
       initialized, using  the  appropriate  set  method,  before
       calling DbLockTab::open:

       void *(*db_errcall)(char *db_errpfx, char *buffer);
       FILE *db_errfile;
       const char *db_errpfx;
       class ostream *db_error_stream;
       int db_verbose;
            The error fields of the DbEnv behave as described for
            <B><A HREF="DbEnv.html">DbEnv(3)</A></B>.

       const u_int8_t lk_conflicts[][];
            A lk_modes by lk_modes array.  A non-0 value for  the
            array element:

                 lk_conflicts[requested_mode][held_mode]

            indicates that requested_mode and held_mode conflict.
            The ``not-granted'' mode must be  represented  by  0.
            If   lk_conflicts   is   NULL,  the  conflicts  array
            db_rw_conflicts  is  used;  see  the  section   below
            entitled ``STANDARD LOCK MODES'' for a description of
            that array.

       u_int32_t lk_detect;
            If non-0, specifies that the deadlock detector be run
            whenever  a lock conflict occurs, and specifies which
            transaction should  be  aborted  in  the  case  of  a
            deadlock.   The lk_detect field must be set to one of
            the following values.

            DB_LOCK_DEFAULT
                 Use the  default  policy  as  specified  in  the
                 <B><A HREF="db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock(1)</A></B> man page.

            DB_LOCK_OLDEST
                 Abort the oldest transaction.

            DB_LOCK_RANDOM
                 Abort  a  random  transaction  involved  in  the
                 deadlock.

            DB_LOCK_YOUNGEST
                 Abort the youngest transaction.

       u_int32_t lk_max;
            The maximum number of locks to be held  or  requested
            in  the table.  This value is used by DbLockTab::open
            to estimate how much space to  allocate  for  various
            lock-table   data   structures.   If  lk_max  is  not
            explicitly set, a default value is used.

       u_int32_t lk_modes;

       The number of lock modes to  be  recognized  by  the  lock
            table (including
            the ``not-granted'' mode).  If  lk_modes  is  0,  the
            value   DB_LOCK_RW_N   is   used;  see  below  for  a
            description of that value.

       The DbLockTab::open  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLockTab::id
       The  DbLockTab::id  method  copies  a  locker ID, which is
       guaranteed to be unique in the specified lock table,  into
       the memory location referenced by idp.

       The  access  methods  (see  Db::open in <B><A HREF="Db.html">Db(3)</A></B>), generate a
       unique locker  ID  for  each  file  that  is  opened  with
       locking.   During  Db access method operation, this locker
       ID will be used for all lock calls  unless  a  transaction
       identifier  was  specified for the call, in which case the
       transaction ID specified is used for locking.

       The  DbLockTab::id  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLockTab::vec
       The  DbLockTab::vec method atomically obtains and releases
       one  or  more  locks  from  the  specified   table.    The
       DbLockTab::vec  method  is intended to support acquisition
       or  trading  of  multiple  locks  under  one  lock   table
       semaphore,   as   is   needed  for  lock  coupling  or  in
       multigranularity locking for lock escalation.

       The locker argument  specified  to  DbLockTab::vec  is  an
       unsigned  32-bit  integer  quantity.   It  represents  the
       entity requesting or releasing the lock.

       The flags value must be set to 0 or the following value:

       DB_LOCK_NOWAIT
            If a lock cannot be  granted  because  the  requested
            lock   conflicts   with   an  existing  lock,  return
            immediately instead of waiting for the lock to become
            available.

       The  list array provided to DbLockTab::vec is typedef'd in
       &lt;db_cxx.h&gt; as DB_LOCKREQ.  A DB_LOCKREQ structure  has  at
       least  the  following  fields,  which  must be initialized
       before calling DbLockTab::vec:

       lockop_t op;
            The operation to be performed, which must be  set  to
            one of the following values:

            DB_LOCK_GET
                 Get  a lock, as defined by the values of locker,
                 obj and mode.  Upon return from  DbLockTab::vec,
                 if  the  lock  field is non-NULL, a reference to
                 the  acquired  lock  is  stored  there.    (This
                 reference   is   invalidated   by  any  call  to
                 DbLockTab::vec or DbLock::put that releases  the
                 lock.)  See <B><A HREF="DbLock.html">DbLock(3)</A></B>.

            DB_LOCK_PUT
                 The  lock referenced by the contents of the lock
                 field is released.

            DB_LOCK_PUT_ALL
                 All locks held by the locker are released.  (Any
                 locks  acquired as a part of the current call to
                 DbLockTab::vec    that    appear    after    the
                 DB_LOCK_PUT_ALL  entry  are  not  considered for
                 this operation).

            DB_LOCK_PUT_OBJ
                 All locks held by the locker, on the object obj,
                 with   the  mode  specified  by  lock_mode,  are
                 released.  A lock_mode of  DB_LOCK_NG  indicates
                 that all locks on the object should be released.
                 Note that any locks acquired as a  part  of  the
                 current call to DbLockTab::vec that occur before
                 the DB_LOCK_PUT_OBJ will also be released; those
                 acquired afterwards will not be released.

       const Dbt obj;
            An  untyped  byte string that specifies the object to
            be locked or released.

       const lockmode_t mode;
            The  lock  mode,  used  as  an  index  into  object's
            conflict array.

       DB_LOCK lock;
            A lock reference.

       The nlist argument specifies the number of elements in the
       list array.
       If any of the requested locks cannot be acquired,  or  any
       of  the  locks  to  be  released  cannot  be released, the
       operations before the failing operation are guaranteed  to
       have  completed successfully, and DbLockTab::vec returns a
       non-zero value.  In addition, if elistp is not NULL, it is
       set  to  point  to  the  DB_LOCKREQ  entry  that was being
       processed when the error occurred.

       In the case of an error, DbLockTab::vec may return one  of
       the following values:

       DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK
            The  specified  locker  was  selected  as a victim in
            order to resolve a deadlock.

       DB_LOCK_NOTHELD
            The lock cannot be released, as it was  not  held  by
            the locker.

       DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED
            A  lock  was  requested that could not be granted and
            the flag parameter was  set  to  DB_LOCK_NOWAIT.   In
            this case, if non-NULL, elistp identifies the request
            that was granted.

       Otherwise,   the   DbLockTab::vec    method    throws    a
       <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or  returns  the value of errno on failure
       and 0 on success.

  DbLockTab::get
       The DbLockTab::get method is a simple interface to the

       DbLockTab::vec functionality, and is equivalent to calling
       the

       DbLockTab::vec method with the locker argument, elistp and
       conflict arguments, and a single element list  array,  for
       which  the op field is DB_LOCK_GET, and the obj, lock_mode
       and lock fields are represented by the  arguments  of  the
       same  name.   Note  that  the  type of the obj argument to
       DbLockTab::get is different from the obj element found  in
       the   DB_LOCKREQ  structure.   The  DbLockTab::get  method
       returns success and failure as described for the

       DbLockTab::vec method.

  DbLockTab::close
       The  DbLockTab::close  method  disassociates  the  calling
       process  from  the  lock  table.  The object should not be
       used after a call to close.   Note  that  DbLockTab::close
       does  not  release  any  locks  still  held by the closing
       process.   (This  provides  functionality  for  long-lived
       locks.)

       Processes  that  wish to have all their locks released can
       do so by issuing the appropriate DbLockTab::vec call.

       In addition, if the dir argument  to  DbLockTab::open  was
       NULL  and  dbenv was not initialized using DbEnv::appinit,
       all files created for this shared region will be  removed,
       as if DbLockTab::unlink were called.

       When  multiple  threads  are  using  the  DbLockTab object
       concurrently,  only  a  single   thread   may   call   the
       DbLockTab::close method.

       The  DbLockTab::close  method  throws  a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLockTab::unlink
       The  DbLockTab::unlink  method  destroys  the  lock  table
       identified  by  the directory dir, removing all files used
       to implement the lock table.  (The directory  dir  is  not
       removed.)    If  there  are  processes  that  have  called
       DbLockTab::open without  calling  DbLockTab::close  (i.e.,
       there  are  processes  currently  using  the  lock table),
       DbLockTab::unlink will fail without further action, unless
       the  force  flag  is  set, in which case DbLockTab::unlink
       will attempt to remove the lock table files regardless  of
       any processes still using the lock table.

       The  result  of  attempting to forcibly destroy the region
       when  a  process  has  the  region  open  is  unspecified.
       Processes  using  a  shared memory region maintain an open
       file descriptor for  it.   On  UNIX  systems,  the  region
       removal  should  succeed  and  processes that have already
       joined the region should continue to  run  in  the  region
       without  change,  however processes attempting to join the
       lock table will either fail or attempt  to  create  a  new
       region.   On other systems, e.g., WNT, where the <B>unlink(2)</B>
       system call will fail if any  process  has  an  open  file
       descriptor for the file, the region removal will fail.

       In  the  case  of catastrophic or system failure, database
       recovery must  be  performed  (see  <B><A HREF="db_recover.html">db_recover(1)</A></B>  or  the
       DB_RECOVER      and      DB_RECOVER_FATAL     flags     to
       <B><A HREF="DbEnv.html">DbEnv::appinit(3)</A></B>).  Alternatively,  if  recovery  is  not
       required  because  no  database state is maintained across
       failures, it is possible to  clean  up  a  lock  table  by
       removing  all  of  the files in the directory specified to
       the DbLockTab::open method, as lock table files are  never
       created  in  any directory other than the one specified to
       DbLockTab::open.   Note,  however,  that  this   has   the
       potential   to  remove  files  created  by  the  other  DB
       subsystems in this database environment.

       The DbLockTab::unlink method throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

  DbLockTab::detect
       The  DbLockTab::detect  method  runs  one iteration of the
       deadlock detector on the current lock table.  The deadlock
       detector  traverses the lock table, detects deadlocks, and
       if  it  finds  one,  marks  one   of   the   participating
       transactions for abort and then returns.

       The  flags  value  is  specified by <B>or</B>'ing together one or
       more of the following values:

       DB_LOCK_CONFLICT
            Only run the deadlock detector if a lock conflict has
            occurred  since  the  last  time  that  the  deadlock
            detector was run.

       The atype parameter specifies which transaction  to  abort
       in  the case of deadlock.  It must be set to one of values
       described above for  the  lk_detect  field  of  the  DbEnv
       object.

       The  DbLockTab::detect  method  throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B> or
       returns the value of errno on failure and 0 on success.

       The DbLockTab::detect method is based on the C lock_detect
       function,  which  is  the  underlying function used by the
       <B><A HREF="db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock(1)</A></B> utility.   See  the  source  code  for  the
       db_deadlock utility for an example of using lock_detect in
       a UNIX environment.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       The following environment variables affect  the  execution
       of db_lock:

       DB_HOME
            If   the   dbenv   argument  to  DbLockTab::open  was
            initialized   using   db_appinit,   the   environment
            variable  DB_HOME  may  be  used  as  the path of the
            database home  for  the  interpretation  of  the  dir
            argument   to   DbLockTab::open,   as   described  in
            <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></B>.

       TMPDIR
            If the dbenv argument to DbLockTab::open was NULL  or
            not  initialized  using  db_appinit,  the environment
            variable TMPDIR may be used as the directory in which
            to  create  the  lock  table,  as  described  in  the
            DbLockTab::open section above.


</PRE>
<H2>STANDARD LOCK MODES</H2><PRE>
       The include file &lt;db_cxx.h&gt;  declares  two  commonly  used
       conflict arrays:

       const u_int8_t db_lock_rw_conflicts[];
            This  is  a  conflict array for a simple scheme using
            shared and exclusive lock modes.

       const u_int8_t db_lock_riw_conflicts[];
            This is a conflict array that involves various intent
            lock  modes  (e.g.,  intent shared) that are used for
            multigranularity locking.

       Their associated sizes are DB_LOCK_RW_N and DB_LOCK_RIW_N.

       In  addition, the include file &lt;db_cxx.h&gt; defines the type
       db_lockmode_t, which is the type of the  lock  modes  used
       with the standard tables above:

              DB_LOCK_NG
                   not granted (always 0)

              DB_LOCK_READ
                   read (shared)

              DB_LOCK_WRITE
                   write (exclusive)


</PRE>
<H2>ERRORS</H2><PRE>
       Methods  marked as returning errno will, by default, throw
       an exception that encapsulates the error information.  The
       default error behavior can be changed, see <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>.

       The  DbLockTab::open  method  may   fail   and   throw   a
       <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>

       or  return  errno  for any of the errors specified for the
       following DB and library functions: <B><A HREF="DbLock.html">DbLock::unlink(3)</A></B>,
       <B>close(2)</B>, <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_version(3)</A></B>, <B>fcntl(2)</B>, <B>fflush(3)</B>, <B>lseek(2)</B>,

       and <B>write(2)</B>.

       In addition, the DbLockTab::open method may fail and throw
       a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or  return  errno  for  the   following
       conditions:

       [EAGAIN]
            The  shared memory region was locked and (repeatedly)
            unavailable.

       [EINVAL]
            An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.

            The DB_THREAD flag was specified  and  spinlocks  are
            not implemented for this architecture.

       The   DbLockTab::vec   method   may   fail   and  throw  a
       <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>

       or return errno for any of the errors  specified  for  the

       In  addition, the DbLockTab::vec method may fail and throw
       a  <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or  return  errno  for  the   following
       conditions:

       [EACCES]
            An  attempt  was made to release lock held by another
            locker.

       [EINVAL]
            An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.

       The  DbLockTab::get  method   may   fail   and   throw   a
       <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>

       In addition, the DbLockTab::get method may fail and  throw
       a   <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  or  return  errno  for  the  following
       conditions:

       [EINVAL]
            An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.

       The  DbLockTab::close  method  may  fail   and   throw   a
       <B><A HREF="DbException.html">DbException(3)</A></B>

       or  return  errno  for any of the errors specified for the
       following DB and library functions: <B>close(2)</B>, <B>fcntl(2)</B>,
       <B>fflush(3)</B>, <B>munmap(2)</B>, and <B>strerror(3)</B>.

       If a process dies while holding locks, those locks  remain
       held  and are <B>never</B> released.  In this case, all processes
       should exit as quickly as possible, so that db_recover can
       be run.
