<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  DB  library  is  a  family of classes that provides a
       modular programming interface to transactions and  record-
       oriented  file  access.   The library includes support for
       transactions, locking, logging and file page  caching,  as
       well  as  various  indexed  access  methods.   Many of the
       classes (e.g., the file page  caching  class)  are  useful
       independent of the other DB classes, although some classes
       are explicitly based on other classes (e.g.,  transactions
       and  logging).   For  a  general  description  of  the  DB
       package, see <B><A HREF="db_intro.html">db_intro(3)</A></B>.

       This manual page describes the specific details of the log
       class.

       This  class  provide  a  general-purpose  logging facility
       sufficient for transaction management.  Logs can be shared
       by multiple processes.

       The  DB  transaction  log  is  represented  by a directory
       containing a set of files.  The log is a  record-oriented,
       append-only file, with records identified and accessed via
       DbLsn's (database log sequence numbers).

       DbLsn's are returned on each DbLog.put operation, and only
       those  DbLsn's  returned by DbLog.put can later be used to
       retrieve records from the log.

  DbLog.open
       The DbLog.open method returns  a  log  identified  by  the
       <B>directory</B> dir.

       If  the dbenv argument to DbLog.open was initialized using
       DbEnv.appinit,  dir  is  interpreted   as   described   by
       <B><A HREF="DbEnv.j.html">DbEnv(3)</A></B>.

       Otherwise,  if dir is not null, it is interpreted relative
       to the current working directory of the process.   If  dir
       is  null,  the following environment variables are checked
       in order: ``TMPDIR'', ``TEMP'', and ``TMP''.   If  one  of
       them  is  set,  log  files  are  created  relative  to the
       directory it specifies.  If none  of  them  are  set,  the
       first  possible  one of the following directories is used:
       /var/tmp, /usr/tmp, /temp, /tmp, C:/temp and C:/tmp.

       All files associated with the  log  are  created  in  this
       directory.    This   directory  must  already  exist  when
       DbLog.open is called.  If  the  log  already  exists,  the
       process  must  have  permission  to  read  and  write  the
       existing files.  If the log does not already exist, it  is
       optionally created and initialized.

       If  the  log  region  is  being  created and log files are
       already present,  the  log  files  are  ``recovered''  and
       subsequent  log writes are appended to the end of the log.

       The log is stored in one or more files  in  the  specified
       directory.  Each file is named using the format

            log.NNNNN

       where  ``NNNNN'' is the sequence number of the file within
       the log.

       The flags and mode arguments specify  how  files  will  be
       opened  and/or created when they don't already exist.  The
       flags value is specified by <B>or</B>'ing together one or more of
       the following values:

       Db.DB_CREATE
            Create  any  underlying  files, as necessary.  If the
            files do not already exist and the DB_CREATE flag  is
            not specified, the call will fail.

       Db.DB_THREAD
            Cause  the  DbLog  handle  returned by the DbLog.open
            method to be useable by  multiple  threads  within  a
            single  address space, i.e., to be ``free-threaded''.
            Threading is assumed in the Java API, so  no  special
            flags  are  required,  and  DB  functions will always
            behave as if the DB_THREAD flag was specified.

       All files created by the log subsystem  are  created  with
       mode  mode  (as described in <B>chmod(2)</B>) and modified by the
       process'  umask  value  at  the  time  of  creation   (see
       <B>umask(2)</B>).   The group ownership of created files is based
       on the system and directory defaults, and is  not  further
       specified by DB.

       The  logging  subsystem  is  configured based on which set
       methods have been used.  It is expected that  applications
       will  use  a single DbEnv object as the argument to all of
       the subsystems in the DB package.  The fields of the DbEnv
       object   used  by  DbLog.open  are  described  below.   As
       references to  the  DbEnv  object  may  be  maintained  by
       DbLog.open,  it  is  necessary  that  the DbEnv object and
       memory  it  references  be  valid  until  the  object   is
       destroyed.    Any   of  the  DbEnv  fields  that  are  not
       explicitly set will default to appropriate values.

       The  following  fields  in  the  DbEnv   object   may   be
       initialized,  using  the  appropriate  set  method, before
       calling DbLog.open:

       DbErrcall db_errcall;
       String db_errpfx;
       int db_verbose;
            The error fields of the DbEnv behave as described for
            <B><A HREF="DbEnv.j.html">DbEnv(3)</A></B>.   void *(*db_errcall)(char *db_errpfx, char
            *buffer);

       FILE *db_errfile;
       const char *db_errpfx;
       int db_verbose;
            The error fields of the DB_ENV  behave  as  described
            for <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></B>.

       int lg_max;
            The  maximum  size  of  a  single  file  in  the log.
            Because  DbLsn  file  offsets  are  unsigned   4-byte
            values,  lg_max  may  not  be larger than the maximum
            unsigned 4-byte value.

            If lg_max is 0, a default value is used.

            See the section "LOG FILE LIMITS" below, for  further
            information.

       The   DbLog.open   method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  that
       encapsulates an errno on failure.

  DbLog.close
       The DbLog.close method closes the log associated with  the
       DbLog object.

       In  addition,  if  the dir argument to DbLog.open was null
       and dbenv was not  initialized  using  DbEnv.appinit,  all
       files  created  for this shared region will be removed, as
       if DbLog.unlink were called.

       When  multiple  threads  are  using   the   DbLog   handle
       concurrently,   only   a   single   thread  may  call  the
       DbLog.close method.

       The  DbLog.close  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   that
       encapsulates an errno on failure.

  DbLog.flush
       The  DbLog.flush  method  guarantees  that all log records
       whose DbLsns are less than or equal to the  lsn  parameter
       have been written to disk.  If lsn is null, all records in
       the log are flushed.

       The  DbLog.flush  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   that
       encapsulates an errno on failure.

  DbLog.get
       The  DbLog.get  method  implements  a cursor inside of the
       log, retrieving records from the log according to the  lsn
       and flags parameters.

       The  data  field  of  the data object is set to the record
       retrieved and the size field indicates the number of bytes
       in  the  record.   See  <B><A HREF="Dbt.j.html">Dbt(3)</A></B>  for a description of other
       fields in the data  object.   <B>When</B>  <B>multiple</B>  <B>threads</B>  <B>are</B>
       <B>using</B>  <B>the</B>  <B>returned</B> <B>DbLog</B> <B>handle</B> <B>concurrently,</B> <B>either</B> <B>the</B>

       <B>for</B> <B>any</B> <B>Dbt</B> <B>used</B> <B>for</B> <B>data</B> <B>retrieval.</B>

       The  flags  parameter  must  be  set to exactly one of the
       following values:

       Db.DB_CHECKPOINT
            The last record written with the  DB_CHECKPOINT  flag
            specified  to the DbLog.put method is returned in the
            data argument.  The lsn argument is overwritten  with
            the  DbLsn  of the record returned.  If no record has
            been previously written with the  DB_CHECKPOINT  flag
            specified, the first record in the log is returned.

            If  the log is empty the DbLog.get method will return
            DB_NOTFOUND.

       Db.DB_FIRST
            The first record from any of the log files  found  in
            the  log  directory is returned in the data argument.
            The lsn argument is overwritten with the DbLsn of the
            record returned.

            If  the log is empty the DbLog.get method will return
            DB_NOTFOUND.

       Db.DB_LAST
            The last record in the log is returned  in  the  data
            argument.   The  lsn argument is overwritten with the
            DbLsn of the record returned.

            If the log is empty, the DbLog.get method will return
            DB_NOTFOUND.

       Db.DB_NEXT
            The  current  log  position  is  advanced to the next
            record in the log and that record is returned in  the
            data  argument.  The lsn argument is overwritten with
            the DbLsn of the record returned.

            If the pointer has not been initialized via DB_FIRST,
            DB_LAST,  DB_SET, DB_NEXT, or DB_PREV, DbLog.get will
            return the first record in the log.  If the last  log
            record has already been returned or the log is empty,
            the DbLog.get method will return DB_NOTFOUND.

            If the log was opened with the  DB_THREAD  flag  set,
            calls  to  DbLog.get  with  the DB_NEXT flag set will
            return EINVAL.

       Db.DB_PREV
            The current log position is  moved  to  the  previous
            record  in the log and that record is returned in the
            data argument.  The lsn argument is overwritten  with
            the DbLsn of the record returned.

            If the pointer has not been initialized via DB_FIRST,
            DB_LAST, DB_SET, DB_NEXT, or DB_PREV, DbLog.get  will
            return  the last record in the log.  If the first log
            record has already been returned or the log is empty,
            the DbLog.get method will return DB_NOTFOUND.

            If  the  log  was opened with the DB_THREAD flag set,
            calls to DbLog.get with the  DB_PREV  flag  set  will
            return EINVAL.

       Db.DB_CURRENT
            Return  the  log  record  currently referenced by the
            log.

            If the log  pointer  has  not  been  initialized  via
            DB_FIRST, DB_LAST, DB_SET, DB_NEXT, or DB_PREV, or if
            the log was  opened  with  the  DB_THREAD  flag  set,
            DbLog.get will return EINVAL.

       Db.DB_SET
            Retrieve  the  record  specified by the lsn argument.
            If the specified DbLsn is  invalid  (e.g.,  does  not
            appear in the log) DbLog.get will return EINVAL.

       Otherwise,  the  DbLog.get  method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B>
       that encapsulates an errno on failure,

  DbLog.compare
       The DbLog.compare method allows the caller to compare  two
       DbLsn's.   DbLog.compare  returns 0 if the two DbLsn's are
       equal, 1 if lsn0 is greater than lsn1, and -1 if  lsn0  is
       less than lsn1.

  DbLog.file
       The  DbLog.file  method  maps  DbLsn's to file names.  The
       DbLog.file method returns the name of the file  containing
       the  record  named by lsn.  (This mapping of DbLsn to file
       is needed for database  administration.   For  example,  a
       transaction  manager  typically records the earliest DbLsn
       needed for restart, and  the  database  administrator  may
       want  to  archive log files to tape when they contain only
       DbLsn's before the earliest one needed for restart.)

       The  DbLog.file  method  throws  a   <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   that
       encapsulates an errno on failure.

  DbLog.put
       The  DbLog.put  method  appends  records  to the log.  The
       DbLsn of the put record is returned in the lsn  parameter.
       The  flags  parameter  may  be set to one of the following
       values:

       Db.DB_CHECKPOINT
            The log should write a checkpoint  record,  recording
            any  information necessary to make the log structures
            recoverable after a crash.

       Db.DB_CURLSN
            The DB_LSN of the next record to be put  is  returned
            in the lsn parameter.

       Db.DB_FLUSH
            The  log  is  forced  to  disk  after  this record is
            written, guaranteeing that all  records  with  DbLsns
            less  than  or equal to the one being put are on disk
            before this method returns  (this  function  is  most
            often used for a transaction commit, see Db.Txn in Db
            (3)).

       The caller is  responsible  for  providing  any  necessary
       structure to data.  (For example, in a write-ahead logging
       protocol, the application must  understand  what  part  of
       data  is an operation code, what part is redo information,
       and what part is  undo  information.   In  addition,  most
       transaction  managers  will store in data the DbLsn of the
       previous log record for the same transaction,  to  support
       chaining back through the transaction's log records during
       undo.)

       The  DbLog.put  method  throws   a   <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B>   that
       encapsulates an errno on failure.

  DbLog.unlink
       The DbLog.unlink method destroys the log region identified
       by the directory dir, removing all files used to implement
       the  log  region.  (The directory dir is not removed.)  If
       there are processes that have  called  DbLog.open  without
       calling  DbLog.close  (i.e., there are processes currently
       using the log  region),  DbLog.unlink  will  fail  without
       further  action,  unless  the  force flag is set, in which
       case DbLog.unlink will attempt to remove  the  log  region
       files  regardless  of  any  processes  still using the log
       region.

       The result of attempting to forcibly  destroy  the  region
       when  a  process  has  the  region  open  is  unspecified.
       Processes using a shared memory region  maintain  an  open
       file  descriptor  for  it.   On  UNIX  systems, the region
       removal should succeed and  processes  that  have  already
       joined  the  region  should  continue to run in the region
       without change, however processes attempting to  join  the
       log  region  will  either  fail or attempt to create a new
       region.  On other systems, e.g., WNT, where the  <B>unlink(2)</B>
       system  call  will  fail  if  any process has an open file
       descriptor for the file, the region removal will fail.

       In the case of catastrophic or  system  failure,  database
       recovery  must  be  performed  (see  <B><A HREF="db_recover.html">db_recover(1)</A></B>  or the
       DB_RECOVER     and     DB_RECOVER_FATAL      flags      to
       <B><A HREF="DbEnv.j.html">DbEnv.appinit(3)</A></B>).   Alternatively,  if  recovery  is  not
       required because no database state  is  maintained  across
       failures,  it  is  possible  to  clean  up a log region by
       removing all of the files in the  directory  specified  to
       the  DbLog.open  method,  as  log  region  files are never
       created in any directory other than the one  specified  to
       DbLog.open.  Note, however, that this has the potential to
       remove files created by the other DB  subsystems  in  this
       database environment.

       The  DbLog.unlink  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  that
       encapsulates an errno on failure.

  DbLog.archive
       The DbLog.archive method creates and returns an  array  of
       log or database file names.

       By  default, DbLog.archive returns the names of all of the
       log files that are no  longer  in  use  (e.g.,  no  longer
       involved in active transactions), and that may be archived
       for  catastrophic  recovery  and  then  removed  from  the
       system.   If there were no file names to return, list will
       be set to null.

       The flags argument is specified by <B>or</B>'ing together one  or
       more of the following values:

       Db.DB_ARCH_ABS
            All  pathnames  are  returned  as absolute pathnames,
            instead of relative to the database home directory.

       Db.DB_ARCH_DATA
            Return the database files that need to be archived in
            order  to  recover  the  database  from  catastrophic
            failure.  If any of the database files have not  been
            accessed  during  the  lifetime  of  the  current log
            files, DbLog.archive will not include  them  in  this
            list.   It  is  also  possible that some of the files
            referenced in the log have since  been  deleted  from
            the system.

       Db.DB_ARCH_LOG
            Return  all  the log file names regardless of whether
            or not they are in use.

       The  DB_ARCH_DATA  and  DB_ARCH_LOG  flags  are   mutually
       exclusive.

       The  DbLog.archive  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B> that
       encapsulates an errno on failure.
       The DbLog.archive method is based  on  the  C  log_archive
       function,  which  is  the  underlying function used by the
       <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B>  utility.   See  the  source  code  for  the
       db_archive  utility for an example of using log_archive in
       a UNIX environment.  See the <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B> manual page for
       more information on database archival procedures.

  DbLog.db_register
       The  DbLog.db_register  method  registers a file name with
       the log manager and returns a file identification  number.
       This  file  identification  number  should  be used in all
       subsequent log messages that refer to operations  on  this
       file.   The  log  manager  records  all  file name to file
       identification number mappings at each checkpoint so  that
       a recovery process can identify the file to which a record
       in the log refers.

       The DbLog.db_register method  is  called  when  an  access
       method  registers  the  open of a file.  The dbp parameter
       should be a Db object  which  is  being  returned  by  the
       access method.

       The type parameter should be one of the Db types specified
       in Db.open (<B><A HREF="seeDb.html">seeDb(3)</A></B>), e.g., DB_HASH.

       The DbLog.db_register method throws a <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B>  that
       encapsulates an errno on failure.

  DbLog.db_unregister
       The DbLog.db_unregister method disassociates the file name
       to  file  identification  number  mapping  for  the   file
       identification number specified by the fid parameter.  The
       file identification number may then be reused.

       The DbLog.db_unregister  method  throws  a  <B><A HREF="DbException.j.html">DbException(3)</A></B>
       that encapsulates an errno on failure.

  DbLog.stat
       The  DbLog.stat  function  creates a statistical structure
       and returns it to the caller.

       The log statistics are stored in a DbLogStat object.  Data
       fields in DbLogStat can be accessed via get methods.

       int get_st_magic();
            The  magic  number  that  identifies  a file as a log
            file.
       int get_st_version();
            The version of the log file type.
       int get_st_refcnt();
            The number of references to the region.
       int get_st_regsize();
            The size of the region.

       int get_st_mode();
            The mode of any created log files.
       int get_st_lg_max();
            The maximum size of any  individual  file  comprising
            the log.
       int get_st_written();
            The total number of bytes written to this log.
       int get_st_written_chkpt();
            The   number   of   bytes   written  since  the  last
            checkpoint.
       int get_st_region_wait();
            The number of times that a process was able to obtain
            the region lock without waiting.
       int get_st_region_nowait();
            The number of times that a process was forced to wait
            before obtaining the region lock.

<H2>LOG FILE LIMITS</H2><PRE>
       Log file sizes impose a time limit on the length of time a
       database  may  be  accessed  under transaction protection,
       before it needs to be dumped and reloaded (see  <B><A HREF="db_dump.html">db_dump(3)</A></B>
       and    <B><A HREF="db_load.html">db_load(3)</A></B>).    Unfortunately,   the   limits   are
       potentially difficult to calculate.

       The log file name consists of "log." followed by 5 digits,
       resulting  in  a maximum of 99,999 log files.  Consider an
       application performing 600 transactions per second, for 15
       hours  a  day,  logged  into  10Mb  log  files, where each
       transaction is logging approximately 100  bytes  of  data.
       The calculation:

              (10 * 2^20 * 99999) /
                   (600 * 60 * 60 * 15 * 100) = 323.63

       indicates  that  the system will run out of log file space
       in roughly 324 days.  If we increase the maximum  size  of
       the  files  from  10Mb  to  100Mb,  the  same  calculation
       indicates that the application will run out  of  log  file
       space in roughly 9 years.

       There  is  no  way  to  reset  the  log file name space in
       Berkeley DB.  If your application is reaching the  end  of
       its log file name space, you should:

       1.   Archive   your   databases   as  if  to  prepare  for
            catastrophic  failure  (see  <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B>  for  more
            information).

       2.   Dump  and  re-load <B>all</B> your databases (see <B><A HREF="db_dump.html">db_dump(1)</A></B>
            and <B><A HREF="db_load.html">db_load(1)</A></B> for more information).

       3.   Remove  all  of  the  log  files  from  the  database
            environment (see <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B> for more information).

       4.   Restart your applications.


</PRE>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES</H2><PRE>
       The following environment variables affect  the  execution
       of db_log:

       DB_HOME
            If  the  dbenv argument to DbLog.open was initialized
            using db_appinit, the  environment  variable  DB_HOME
            may  be used as the path of the database home for the
            interpretation of the dir argument to DbLog.open,  as
            described in <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></B>.  Specifically, DbLog.open
            is affected by  the  configuration  string  value  of
            DB_LOG_DIR.

       TMPDIR
            If  the  dbenv argument to DbLog.open was null or not
            initialized   using   db_appinit,   the   environment
            variable TMPDIR may be used as the directory in which
            to create the log, as  described  in  the  DbLog.open
            section above.
