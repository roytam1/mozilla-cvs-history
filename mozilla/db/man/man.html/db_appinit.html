<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2><PRE>
       The  DB  library  is  a family of groups of functions that
       provides a modular programming interface  to  transactions
       and  record-oriented  file  access.   The library includes
       support for transactions, locking, logging and  file  page
       caching,  as well as various indexed access methods.  Many
       of the functional groups  (e.g.,  the  file  page  caching
       functions)   are   useful  independent  of  the  other  DB
       functions, although some functional groups are  explicitly
       based  on  other functional groups (e.g., transactions and
       logging).  For a general description of  the  DB  package,
       see <B><A HREF="db_intro.html">db_intro(3)</A></B>.

  db_version
       The  db_version  function  returns  a  pointer to a string
       containing DB version information.  If major is  non-NULL,
       the  major  version  of  the  DB  release is stored in the
       memory it references.  If minor  is  non-NULL,  the  minor
       version  of  the  DB  release  is  stored in the memory it
       references.  If patch is non-NULL, the  patch  version  of
       the DB release is stored in the memory it references.

  db_appinit
       The   db_appinit   function   provides  a  simple  way  to
       initialize and configure the DB environment.   It  is  not
       necessary  that  it be called, but it provides a method of
       creating a consistent environment for processes using  one
       or more of the features of DB.

       The  db_home  and  db_config  arguments  to db_appinit are
       described in the section below entitled ``FILE NAMING''.

       The flags  argument  specifies  the  subsystems  that  are
       initialized  and  how  the  environment  affects  DB  file
       naming, among other things.  The flags value is  specified
       by <B>or</B>'ing together one or more of the following values:

       DB_CREATE
            Cause  subsystems  to create any underlying files, as
            necessary.  (See <B><A HREF="db_lock.html">db_lock(3)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="db_log.html">db_log(3)</A></B>,  <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">db_mpool(3)</A></B>,
            <B><A HREF="db_open.html">db_open(3)</A></B> and <B><A HREF="db_txn.html">db_txn(3)</A></B> for more information.)

       DB_INIT_LOCK
            Initialize  the lock subsystem; see <B><A HREF="db_lock.html">db_lock(3)</A></B>.  This
            subsystem should be used when multiple  processes  or
            threads  are  going  to  be  reading and writing a DB
            database, so that they do  not  interfere  with  each
            other.   If all threads are accessing the database(s)
            read-only, then locking  is  unnecessary.   When  the
            DB_INIT_LOCK   flag   is  specified,  it  is  usually
            necessary   to    run    the    deadlock    detector,
            <B><A HREF="db_deadlock.html">db_deadlock(1)</A></B>, as well.

       DB_INIT_LOG
            Initialize  the  log  subsystem; see <B><A HREF="db_log.html">db_log(3)</A></B>.  This
            subsystem is used when recovery from  application  or
            system failure is important.

       DB_INIT_MPOOL
            Initialize  the  mpool  subsystem;  see  <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">db_mpool(3)</A></B>.
            This subsystem is used whenever  the  application  is
            using the DB access methods for any purpose.

       DB_INIT_TXN
            Initialize  the transaction subsystem; see <B><A HREF="db_txn.html">db_txn(3)</A></B>.
            This subsystem is used  when  atomicity  of  multiple
            operations   and   recovery   are   important.    The
            DB_INIT_TXN flag implies the DB_INIT_LOG flag.

       DB_MPOOL_PRIVATE
            Create a private memory  pool  (see  <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">db_mpool(3)</A></B>  for
            further  information).   Ignored unless DB_INIT_MPOOL
            is also specified.

       DB_NOMMAP
            Do not map any files  within  this  environment  (see
            <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">db_mpool(3)</A></B> for further information).  Ignored unless
            DB_INIT_MPOOL is also specified.

       DB_RECOVER
            Run  normal  recovery  on  this  environment   before
            opening  it for normal use.  If this flag is set, the
            DB_CREATE flag must also be  set  since  the  regions
            will be removed and recreated.

            The   db_appinit  function  returns  successfully  if
            DB_RECOVER is specified and no log files exist, so it
            is  necessary  to  ensure all necessary log files are
            present  before  running   recovery.    For   further
            information,  consult  the man page for <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B>
            and <B><A HREF="db_recover.html">db_recover(1)</A></B>.

       DB_RECOVER_FATAL
            Run catastrophic recovery on this environment  before
            opening  it for normal use.  If this flag is set, the
            DB_CREATE flag must also be  set  since  the  regions
            will be removed and recreated.

            The   db_appinit  function  returns  successfully  if
            DB_RECOVER is specified and no log files exist, so it
            is  necessary  to  ensure all necessary log files are
            present  before  running   recovery.    For   further
            information,  consult  the man page for <B><A HREF="db_archive.html">db_archive(1)</A></B>
            and <B><A HREF="db_recover.html">db_recover(1)</A></B>.

       DB_THREAD
            Ensure that handles returned by the DB subsystems are
            useable  by multiple threads within a single process,
            i.e., that the  system  is  ``free-threaded''.   (See
            <B><A HREF="db_lock.html">db_lock(3)</A></B>,  <B><A HREF="db_log.html">db_log(3)</A></B>,  <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">db_mpool(3)</A></B>,  <B><A HREF="db_open.html">db_open(3)</A></B> and
            <B><A HREF="db_txn.html">db_txn(3)</A></B> for more information.)

       DB_TXN_NOSYNC
            On transaction commit, do not synchronously flush the
            log (see <B><A HREF="db_txn.html">db_txn(3)</A></B> for further information).  Ignored
            unless DB_INIT_TXN is also specified.

       DB_USE_ENVIRON
            The DB  process'  environment  may  be  permitted  to
            specify information to be used when naming files (see
            the section  entitled  ``FILE  NAMING''  below).   As
            permitting  users to specify which files are used can
            create  security  problems,  environment  information
            will be used in file naming for all users only if the
            DB_USE_ENVIRON flag is set.

       DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT
            The DB  process'  environment  may  be  permitted  to
            specify information to be used when naming files (see
            the section  entitled  ``FILE  NAMING''  below).   As
            permitting  users to specify which files are used can
            create security problems, if the  DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT
            flag is set, environment information will be used for
            file naming only for users with  a  user-ID  matching
            that  of  the superuser (specifically, users for whom
            the getuid system call returns the user-ID 0).

       The DB  environment  is  configured  based  on  the  dbenv
       argument  to db_appinit, which is a pointer to a structure
       of type DB_ENV (typedef'd in &lt;db.h&gt;).   Applications  will
       normally  use  the  same  DB_ENV structure (initialized by
       <B><A HREF="db_appinit.html">db_appinit(3)</A></B>), as an argument to all of the subsystems in
       the DB package.

       References  to  the DB_ENV structure are maintained by DB,
       so it may not be discarded until the last close  function,
       corresponding  to  an  open  function  for which it was an
       argument, has returned.  In order to ensure  compatibility
       with  future  releases  of  DB,  all  fields of the DB_ENV
       structure  that  are  not   explicitly   set   should   be
       initialized  to  0  before the first time the structure is
       used.  Do this by  declaring  the  structure  external  or
       static,  or  by  calling the C library routine <B>bzero(3)</B> or
       <B>memset(3)</B>.

       The fields of the DB_ENV structure used by db_appinit  are
       described  below.  The dbenv argument may not be NULL.  If
       any of the fields of the dbenv  are  set  to  0,  defaults
       appropriate for the system are used where possible.

       The  following  fields  in  the  DB_ENV  structure  may be
       initialized before calling db_appinit:

       void (*db_errcall)(char *db_errpfx, char *buffer);
            When an error occurs in  the  DB  package,  an  errno
            value  is  returned  by the function.  In some cases,
            however, the  errno  value  may  be  insufficient  to
            completely describe the cause of the error.

            If  db_errcall  is  non-NULL,  it  may be called with
            additional error information.  The db_errpfx argument
            is  the  current  environment's db_errpfx field.  The
            buffer argument contains a nul-terminated string with
            the additional information.

            This  error  logging  facility should not be required
            for normal operation, but may be useful in  debugging
            applications.

       FILE *db_errfile;
            The   db_errfile   field  behaves  similarly  to  the
            db_errcall field, except that the  error  message  is
            written to the file stream represented by db_errfile.

            If  db_errpfx  is  non-NULL,  the  message  will   be
            preceded  by  the  string  referenced by db_errpfx, a
            colon (``:'') and  a  space.   The  message  will  be
            followed by a newline character.

       const char *db_errpfx;
            A  prefix  to  prepend to error messages.  Because DB
            does not copy the memory referenced by the  db_errpfx
            field,  the  application may modify the error message
            prefix at any time.

       int db_verbose;
            Include informational and debugging messages as  well
            as  error  messages  in the db_errcall and db_errfile
            output.

       Each of  the  open  functions  that  db_appinit  may  call
       (lock_open, log_open, memp_open and txn_open) is called as
       follows, where the DB_CREATE flag is optional:

            XXX_open(NULL, DB_CREATE,
               S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP, dbenv)

       This call will cause each subsystem to construct pathnames
       as  described  in  the  section  on  ``FILE NAMING''.  The
       subsystem has permission  to  read  and  write  underlying
       files  as necessary, and optionally to create files.  (All
       created files will be created readable  and  writeable  by
       the  owner  and the group.  The group ownership of created
       files is based on the system and directory  defaults,  and
       is not further specified by DB.)

       In  addition,  the  dbenv  argument  is passed to the open
       functions of any  subsystems  initialized  by  db_appinit.
       For  this  reason  the  fields  of  the  DB_ENV  structure
       relevant  to  the  subsystems   being   initialized   must
       themselves  be  initialized  before  db_appinit is called.
       See the manual page for each subsystem for a list of these
       fields and their uses.

       The return value from each of these calls is placed in the
       appropriate field of the DB_ENV structure:

       DB_LOCKTAB *lk_info;
            The return value of the <B><A HREF="db_lock.html">lock_open(3)</A></B> call.

       DB_LOG *lg_info;
            The return value of the <B><A HREF="db_log.html">log_open(3)</A></B> call.

       DB_MPOOL *mp_info;
            The return value of the <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">memp_open(3)</A></B> call.

       DB_TXNMGR *tx_info;
            The return value of the <B><A HREF="db_txn.html">txn_open(3)</A></B> call.

       In  general,  these  fields  are  not  directly  used   by
       applications;  subsystems of DB that use these fields will
       simply reference them using the DB_ENV argument passed  to
       the subsystem.

       For  example,  an  application  using  the  DB hash access
       method functions to access  a  database  will  first  call
       db_open  passing  it  the DB_ENV argument filled in by the
       initial call to db_appinit.  Then, all future calls to the
       hash  access  method  functions  for  that  database  will
       automatically use the underlying shared memory buffer pool
       that  was  specified  by  the mp_info field of that DB_ENV
       argument.

       The single exception to this rule is  the  tx_info  field,
       which   applications   must   explicitly  specify  to  the
       txn_begin, txn_checkpoint and txn_close functions.

       Once the DB environment has been initialized by a call  to
       db_appinit,  no  fields  other  than  db_errpfx  should be
       modified.

       The db_appinit function returns  the  value  of  errno  on
       failure and 0 on success.

  db_appexit
       The   db_appexit   function   closes  the  initialized  DB
       subsystems, freeing any allocated  resources  and  closing
       any underlying subsystems.

       When   multiple   threads  are  using  the  DB_ENV  handle
       concurrently, only a single thread may call the db_appexit
       function.

       The  db_appexit  function  returns  the  value of errno on
       failure and 0 on success.


</PRE>
<H2>FILE NAMING</H2><PRE>
       The most important task of db_appinit is to structure file
       naming within DB.

       Each  of the locking, logging, memory pool and transaction
       subsystems of DB require shared memory regions, backed  by
       the  filesystem.   Further,  cooperating  applications (or
       multiple invocations of the same application)  must  agree
       on  the  location  of  the shared memory regions and other
       files used by the DB subsystems, the log files used by the
       logging subsystem, and, of course, the data files.

       Although  it  is possible to specify full pathnames to all
       DB  functions,  this  is  cumbersome  and  requires   that
       applications  be recompiled when database files are moved.
       The  db_appinit  function  makes  it  possible  to   place
       database  files  in  a  single  directory,  or in multiple
       directories,  grouped  by  their   function   within   the
       database.

       Applications  are  normally  expected  to specify a single
       directory home for  their  database.   This  can  be  done
       easily in the call to db_appinit by specifying a value for
       the   db_home   argument.    There   are   more    complex
       configurations  where  it  may  be  desirable  to override
       db_home or provide supplementary path information.

       The following describes the possible ways  in  which  file
       naming  information  may  be  specified to the DB library.
       The specific circumstances and order in which  these  ways
       are applied are described in a subsequent paragraph.

       db_home
            If  the  db_home  argument to db_appinit is non-NULL,
            its value may be used as the database home, and files
            named relative to its path.

       DB_HOME
            If  the  DB_HOME  environment  variable  is  set when
            db_appinit is called, its value may be  used  as  the
            database  home, and files named relative to its path.

       db_config
            The db_config argument to db_appinit may be  used  to
            specify  an  array of character strings of the format
            ``NAME VALUE'', that specify  file  name  information
            for  the  process'  DB  environment.   The whitespace
            delimiting the two parts of the entry may be  one  or
            more   &lt;space&gt;  or  &lt;tab&gt;  characters.   (Leading  or
            trailing &lt;space&gt; and &lt;tab&gt; characters are discarded.)
            Each  entry  must specify both the NAME and the VALUE
            of the pair.   All  entries  with  unrecognized  NAME
            values  will be ignored.  The db_config array must be
            NULL terminated.

       DB_CONFIG
            The  same  information  specified  to  the  db_config
            argument  to  db_appinit  may  be  specified  using a
            configuration file.  If a database home directory has
            been  specified (either by the application specifying
            a non-NULL db_home argument to db_appinit, or by  the
            application    setting    the    DB_USE_ENVIRON    or
            DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT flags and the DB_HOME environment
            variable  being set), any file named ``DB_CONFIG'' in
            the database home directory will be read for lines of
            the format ``NAME VALUE''.  The whitespace delimiting
            the two parts of the line may be one or more  &lt;space&gt;
            or  &lt;tab&gt;  characters.   (Leading or trailing &lt;space&gt;
            and &lt;tab&gt; characters are discarded.)  All empty lines
            or  lines  whose  first non-whitespace character is a
            hash character (``#'') will be  ignored.   Each  line
            must specify both the NAME and the VALUE of the pair.
            All lines  with  unrecognized  NAME  values  will  be
            ignored.

       The  following  ``NAME  VALUE''  pairs  in  the  db_config
       argument and the DB_CONFIG file are currently supported by
       DB.

       DB_DATA_DIR
            The path of a directory to be used as the location of
            the access method data files, e.g.,  paths  specified
            to  the  <B><A HREF="db_open.html">db_open(3)</A></B> function will be relative to this
            path.

            The DB_DATA_DIR paths are  additive,  and  specifying
            more than one will result in each specified directory
            being searched for database data files.  If  multiple
            paths  are  specified, created data files will always
            be created in the <B>first</B> directory specified.

       DB_LOG_DIR
            The path of a directory to be used as the location of
            logging  files,  e.g., files created by the <B><A HREF="db_log.html">db_log(3)</A></B>
            subsystem will be relative  to  this  directory.   If
            specified,  this  is  the directory name that will be

       DB_TMP_DIR
            The path of a directory to be used as the location of
            temporary  files,  e.g.,  files  created  to back in-
            memory  access  method  databases  will  be   created
            relative  to  this path.  Note, these temporary files
            can potentially be quite large, depending on the size
            of the database.

            If   DB_TMP_DIR   is  not  specified,  the  following
            environment   variables   are   checked   in   order:
            ``TMPDIR'', ``TEMP'', ``TMP'' and ``TempFolder''.  If
            one of them  is  set,  temporary  files  are  created
            relative to the directory it specifies.

            If  DB_TMP_DIR is not specified and none of the above
            environment variables are set, the first possible one
            of  the  following  directories  is  used:  /var/tmp,
            /usr/tmp, /temp, /tmp, C:/temp and C:/tmp.

       The following describes  the  specific  circumstances  and
       order  in  which  the  different  ways  of specifying file
       naming information are  applied.   Specifically,  DB  file
       name   processing   proceeds   sequentially   through  the
       following steps:

       ``/''
            If any file name specified to any DB function  begins
            with  a leading slash, that file name is used without
            modification by DB.

       DB_CONFIG
            If   a   relevant   configuration    string    (e.g.,
            DB_DATA_DIR),   is   specified   in   the   DB_CONFIG
            configuration file, the VALUE from the ``NAME VALUE''
            pair  is  prepended to the current file name.  If the
            resulting file name begins with a leading slash,  the
            file name is used without further modification by DB.

            The  DB_CONFIG  configuration  file  is  intended  to
            permit  systems  to  customize  file  location  for a
            database  independent  of  applications  using   that
            database.   For example, a database administrator can
            move the database log and data files to  a  different
            location without application recompilation.

       db_config
            If    a    relevant   configuration   string   (e.g.,
            DB_DATA_DIR), is specified in the db_config  argument
            and is not specified in the DB_CONFIG file, the VALUE
            from the ``NAME VALUE''  pair  is  prepended  to  the
            current file name.  If the resulting file name begins
            with a leading slash, the file name is  used  without
            further modification by DB.

            The   db_config   argument   is  intended  to  permit
            applications  to  customize  file  location   for   a
            database.   For  example,  an  application writer can
            place  data  files  and  log   files   in   different
            directories,  or instantiate a new log directory each
            time the application runs.

       DB_HOME
            If the DB_HOME environment variable was set, (and the
            application has set the appropriate DB_USE_ENVIRON or
            DB_USE_ENVIRON_ROOT environment variable), its  value
            is  prepended  to  the  current  file  name.   If the
            resulting file name begins with a leading slash,  the
            file name is used without further modification by DB.

            The  DB_HOME  environment  variable  is  intended  to
            permit  users  and  system administrators to override
            application and installation defaults, e.g.,

                 env DB_HOME=/database/my_home application

            Alternatively, application writers are encouraged  to
            support  the  <B>-h</B>  option  found  in the supporting DB
            utilities to let users specify a database home.

       db_home
            If  the  application  specified  a  non-NULL  db_home
            argument to db_appinit (and the database home was not
            already  specified  using  the  DB_HOME   environment
            variable)  its value is prepended to the current file
            name.  If the  resulting  file  name  begins  with  a
            leading  slash, the file name is used without further
            modification by DB.

       (nothing)
            Finally, all file names are interpreted  relative  to
            the current working directory of the process.

       The  common  model  for a DB environment is one where only
       the DB_HOME environment variable, or the db_home argument,
       is  specified.   In  this  case,  all  data  files will be
       presumed to be relative to that directory, and  all  files
       created  by  the  DB  subsystems  will  be created in that
       directory.

       The more complex model for a transaction environment might
       be  one  where  a database home is specified, using either
       the DB_HOME environment variable or the  db_home  argument
       to db_appinit, and then DB_DATA_DIR and DB_LOG_DIR are set
       to the relative path names of directories  underneath  the
       home  directory using the db_config argument to db_appinit
       or the DB_CONFIG file.

       Store all files in the directory /a/database:

              db_appinit("/a/database", NULL, ...);

       Create temporary backing files in  /b/temporary,  and  all
       other files in /a/database:

              char *config[] = {
                  "DB_TMP_DIR /b/temporary",
                  NULL
              };

              db_appinit("/a/database", config, ...);

       Store  data  files  in  /a/database/datadir,  log files in
       /a/database/logdir, and all other files in  the  directory
       /a/database:

              char *config[] = {
                  "DB_DATA_DIR datadir",
                  "DB_LOG_DIR logdir",
                  NULL

       Store  data  files  in /a/database/data1 and /b/data2, and
       all other files in the directory  /a/database.   Any  data
       files that are created will be created in /b/data2:

              char *config[] = {
                  "DB_DATA_DIR /b/data2",
                  "DB_DATA_DIR data1",
                  NULL
              };

              db_appinit("/a/database", config, ...);

       See  the  file  examples/ex_appinit.c  in  the  DB  source
       distribution for a C  language  code  example  of  how  an
       application  might  use  db_appinit  to  configure  its DB
       environment.

       In  addition,  the db_appinit function may fail and return
       errno for the following conditions:

       [EINVAL]
            An invalid flag value or parameter was specified.

            The DB_THREAD flag was specified  and  spinlocks  are
            not implemented for this architecture.

            The   DB_RECOVER   or   DB_RECOVER_FATAL   flag   was
            specified, and no log files were found.

            The DB_HOME or TMPDIR environment variables were  set
            but empty.

            An incorrectly formatted ``NAME VALUE'' entry or line
            was found.

       [ENOSPC]
            HP-UX only: a previously created DB  environment  for
            this process still exists.

       The  db_appexit function may fail and return errno for any
       of the errors specified for the following DB  and  library
       functions: <B><A HREF="db_lock.html">lock_close(3)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="db_log.html">log_close(3)</A></B>, <B><A HREF="db_mpool.html">memp_close(3)</A></B>, and
       <B><A HREF="db_txn.html">txn_close(3)</A></B>.


</PRE>
<H2>BUGS</H2><PRE>
       Due to the constraints of the PA-RISC memory architecture,
       HP-UX  does  not  allow  a  process to map a file into its
       address space multiple times.  For this  reason,  each  DB
       environment may be opened only once by a process on HP-UX,
       i.e., calls to appinit  will  fail  if  the  specified  DB
       environment has been opened and not subsequently closed.

       On Windows/95, files that are opened by multiple processes
       do not share data correctly.  To tell Berkeley DB  to  use
       the  paging  file to share memory among processes, use the
       DB_REGION_NAME  flag   of   the   db_value_set   function.
       Obviously,  you  do  not  need to do this if only a single
       process will be accessing database files.
