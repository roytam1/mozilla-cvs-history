OVERVIEW

JSC (JavaScript Compiler) is a stand-alone front-end implementation
of the JS2 language specification. Its purpose is to demonstrate how
JS2 programs are statically prepared for execution by a JS2 interpreter. 
Its output is a psuedo intermediate language suitable for reading by
human beings.

RUNNING JSC

With a Java Runtime Environment installed, go to the directory ./bin
and issue the command:

	java -classpath jsc.jar Main program.js

program.js is the name of the file to compile. JSC will
produce a new file given the name of the original source file
with the suffix .jsil appended to it. Errors are written to a 
file with the suffix .err appended to it.

BUILDING JSC

Go to the directory ./build/java, and run your favorite make
utility. Such as with the command:

	nmake

If all goes well, the file ./bin/jsc.jar will be updated.

CHANGES

Nov-30-2000
-----------
* Folded definition evaluation into constant evaluation since annotated
  definitions cannot be evaluated until the constant attribute values
  have been computed. Now there is a BlockEvaluator and a ConstantEvaluator.
* Added an error handler to the constant evaluator.
* Simplified the type system.

* Original release.
