/* Error Message definitions. */

/* 
* The format here is the same as that in js/src/js.msg
* However, arguments are not supported. And, the error->exception
* mapping is not appropriate here. So, the arg count and exception id 
* columns are left with zero values.
*
* Also, the idetifiers here are read in as members of an anonymous enum in
* the class XPCJSError rather than at the top level as in JS.
