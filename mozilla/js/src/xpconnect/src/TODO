/* jband - 03/06/01 - Stuff to do soon */

- FIX these things:
    ! FIX resolve in setProperty brendan bug 72354
    - FIX nested enumerate with scriptable helper
    - FIX xpccomponets.cpp use of scriptable to deal better with prototype use

- FEATURES
    - mstoltz wants 'clearAllSecurityPolicy' method
    - followup with shaver on classinfo maps (shared with table driven QI?)
    - deal with shaver's string changes
    ? add HasInstance (or whatever) to nsIClassInfo

- VERIFY these things:
    - VERIFY nsXPConnect::ReparentWrappedNativeIfFound
    - VERIFY that locking work is DONE.
    - VERIFY that scriptable flags are being honored
    - VERIFY that we honor nsIClassInfo flags
    - VERIFY cleanup of unused stuff
    - VERIFY only share protos if scriptable flag says so.

- FOORPRINT & PERFORMANCE
    ? Remove mMaybeSecurityInfo. The idea is that wrappers w/o protos
      would not have security info. Instead we'd have a union of
      mMaybeProto and mMaybeScope. We'd flag whether or not the object
      has a proto by whether or not the low bit of one of our members
      was set (maybe mScriptableInfo?). then we'd have to carefully always
      mask that bit of that member whenever it is accessed. This saves us 
      one pointer per wrapper. We have ~1000 live wrappers. That's 4k.
      Need to check with Mitch to see if we agree that we will *never* 
      need that security info pointer on objects w/o protos.
    ? look into optional hashtable in interface sets
        FWIW, I'm thinking this is likely to not be a real win.
        The JS engine caches the bulk of such lookups for us anyway.


- CODE MAINTAINABILITY
    - more code comments

- CODE INSTRUMENTATION
    - improve DebugDump stuff
    - stats gathering/reporting code
    ? debug code to point out *use* of potentially shadowed members
    - add code to discover QIable interfaces not mentioned in nsIClassInfo

- TESTS - we need tests for:
    - look into hooking up to JS test suite
    - use what can be used from cbegle's xpconnect tests
    - add multi-threaded tests

- DOCS
    - update typelib spec ([astring] and [function])
    - add isSuccessCode to Components doc
    - xpconnect api docs
    - discussion of flattening and implications
    - add to the faqs
