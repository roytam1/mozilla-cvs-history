/* jband - 02/20/99 - TODO and issues list */

**** ISSUES ****
- convert some assertions to LOG warnings
- Ports!
- proto object per class?
- Param gc rooting?
- safe use of jsdoubles?

- Write Docs!
- improve nsID JS class
- add xpcom JS object and util functions
- reflect IID and CID trees. 
- ProgIDs? (mixed in with CID tree or separate?)
- errors
    - throw exceptions into JS?
- loosen restrictions re. current cx when calling wrappers across cx boundaries


**** ISSUES ****

- Contexts\Runtimes\ScopeChain problems

- Constants fo WrappedJS objects? 
    - Even for WrappedNatives the constants should (perhaps) be in the 
      (as yet not created) class proto object rather than props of each object?
      This makes then overwritable?

- Ref counting for contexts?

- JSContext and JSRuntime life times and how that impacts XPConnect stuff

- wrappedJS stub stuff can't handle (non-xpcom) natives passed by value -
  we need to know the object size to cleanup the stack!

- Listener interface for class and instance create/destroy?
