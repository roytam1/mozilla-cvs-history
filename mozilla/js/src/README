The js/ref directory contains standalone ANSI-C source for the Netscape
JavaScript Reference implementation, JSRef, which was licensed to over 180
companies as part of Netscape ONE, starting in fall 1996.  Now, JSRef is
available under NPL from http://www.mozilla.org.

The js/src directory contains source files listed in the file "commfiles",
that are derived via prconv.sed from counterparts in the js/ref directory.
It also contains files such as jscompat.h that are not needed in js/ref.
The Makefile in js/src has refconv and refdiff targets to help keep js/ref
and js/src in synch.

If you think you need to change a file listed in commfiles here, please
make the change in js/ref first and then use prconv.sed or gmake refconv to
get it into js/src.  If you have trouble, please let us know by mailing the
JS owner and peers listed in http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html#JavaScript.
