Introduction</H2>
This is the README file for the JavaScript LiveConnect implementation.&nbsp;
It consists of build conventions and instructions, source code conventions,
a design walk-through, and a brief file-by-file description of the source.

<P>This document assumes basic familiarity with JSRef, the reference implementation
of JavaScript, and with the LiveConnect technology&nbsp; (LiveConnect allows
JavaScript and Java virtual machines to be connected.&nbsp; It enables
JavaScript to access Java fields, invoke Java methods and makes it possible
for Java to access JavaScript object properties and evaluate JavaScript.&nbsp;
More information on LiveConnect can be found by searching the index on
Netscape's <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com">DevEdge site</A>.)

<P>JSRef builds a library or DLL containing the JavaScript runtime (compiler,
interpreter, decompiler, garbage collector, atom manager, standard classes).&nbsp;
The LiveConnect project/makefiles build a library that links both with
JSRef and with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that implements the Java Native
Interface (JNI), as specified by JavaSoft.&nbsp; It then compiles a small
"shell" program and links that with the library to make an interpreter
that can be used interactively and with test scripts.

<H2>
Build conventions</H2>
To enable multi-threaded execution, define the <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>JS_THREADSAFE</FONT></TT>
cpp macro and flesh out the stubs and required headers in jslock.c/.h.&nbsp;
See the JS API docs for more.&nbsp; JSRef must also be built with <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>JS_THREADSAFE</FONT></TT>.

<P>Update your JVM's <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>CLASSPATH</FONT></TT> to point to
the <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>liveconnect/classes</FONT></TT> subdirectory.&nbsp;
If you do not, LiveConnect will still operate but with the limitation that
JS objects may not be passed as arguments of Java methods and it will not
be possible to call from Java into JavaScript, i.e. the <I>netscape.javascript.JSObject</I>
class will be inaccessible.
<UL><B>Windows</B>
<UL>
<LI>
Use MSDEV5.0 (LiveConnectShell.dsw).</LI>

<LI>
You must first build the JS runtime, js32.dll, by using the normal JSRef
build procedure.</LI>

<LI>
Identify the JVM that you are linking against by setting the <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>JDK</FONT></TT>
environment variable to point to the top-level JDK directory, e.g. <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>D:\jdk1.1.5</FONT></TT>.&nbsp;
This is used to establish paths for header file inclusion, linking and
execution.&nbsp; If you are not using Sun's JVM, the project files may
require manual tweaking to set these paths correctly.</LI>

<LI>
The output files (DLLs and executables) are placed in the <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>js/ref/liveconnect/Debug</FONT></TT>
or <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>js/ref/liveconnect/Release</FONT></TT> directories.</LI>

<LI>
The LiveConnect-enabled shell is named <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>lcshell.exe</FONT></TT>
and appears in the output directory.</LI>

<LI>
You must have the JVM DLL in your <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>PATH</FONT></TT> environment
variable in order to run.&nbsp; If you are using the Sun JDK, the DLL appears
in the JDK's bin directory.</LI>
</UL>
<B>Mac</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">LiveConnect is known to build on the Mac, but no
project files created yet</FONT></LI>

<LI>
Use CodeWarrior 1.x (???.prj.hqx) or 2 (???.prj2.hqx).</LI>
</UL>
<B>Unix</B>
<UL>
<LI>
<FONT COLOR="#FF0000">No Makefiles created yet</FONT></LI>

<LI>
Use vendor cc or gcc (ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu) for compiling,&nbsp;
and use gmake for building.</LI>

<LI>
To compile optimized code, set BUILD_OPT=1 on the nmake/gmake command line
or preset it in the environment or makefile.&nbsp; The C preprocessor macro
DEBUG&nbsp; will be undefined, and NDEBUG (archaic Unix-ism for "No Debugging")
will be defined.&nbsp; Without BUILD_OPT, DEBUG is predefined and NDEBUG
is undefined.</LI>

<LI>
Your own debug flag, DEBUG_$USER, will be defined or undefined as BUILD_OPT
is unset or set.</LI>

<LI>
To add C compiler options from the make command line, set XCFLAGS=-Dfoo.</LI>

<LI>
To predefine -D or -U options in the makefile, set DEFINES.</LI>

<LI>
To predefine -I options in the makefile, set INCLUDES.</LI>
</UL>
</UL>

<H2>
Naming and coding conventions:</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
Public function names begin with JSJ_ followed by capitalized "intercaps",&nbsp;
e.g. JSJ_ConnectToJavaVM.</LI>

<LI>
Extern but library-private function names use a jsj_ prefix and mixed case,
e.g. jsj_LookupSymbol.</LI>

<LI>
Most static function names have unprefixed, underscore-separated names:
get_char.</LI>

<LI>
But static native methods of JS objects have intercaps names, e.g., JavaObject_getProperty().</LI>

<LI>
And library-private and static data use underscores, not intercaps (but
library-private data do use a js_ prefix).</LI>

<LI>
Scalar type names are lowercase and js-prefixed: jsdouble.</LI>

<LI>
Aggregate type names are JS-prefixed and mixed-case: JSObject.</LI>

<LI>
Macros are generally ALL_CAPS and underscored, to call out potential side
effects, multiple uses of a formal argument, etc.</LI>

<LI>
Four spaces of indentation per statement nesting level.&nbsp; The files
are space-filled, so adjusting of your tab setting should be unnecessary.</LI>

<LI>
DLL entry points have their return type expanded within a PR_PUBLIC_API()&nbsp;
macro call, to get the right Windows secret type qualifiers in the right
places for both 16- and 32-bit builds.</LI>

<LI>
Callback functions that might be called from a DLL are similarly macroized
with PR_STATIC_CALLBACK (if the function otherwise would be static to hide
its name) or PR_CALLBACK (this macro takes no type argument; it should
be used after the return type and before the function name).</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
The LiveConnect API</H2>
All public LiveConnect entry points and callbacks are documented in jsjava.h,
the header file that exports those functions.
