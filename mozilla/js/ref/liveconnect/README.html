<H2>
Introduction</H2>
This is the README file for the JavaScript LiveConnect implementation.&nbsp;
It consists of build conventions and instructions, source code conventions,
and a brief file-by-file description of the source.

<P>This document assumes basic familiarity with JSRef, the reference implementation
of JavaScript, and with the LiveConnect technology&nbsp; (LiveConnect allows
JavaScript and Java virtual machines to be connected.&nbsp; It enables
JavaScript to access Java fields, invoke Java methods and makes it possible
for Java to access JavaScript object properties and evaluate JavaScript.&nbsp;
More information on LiveConnect can be found by searching the index on
Netscape's <A HREF="http://developer.netscape.com">DevEdge site</A>.)

<P>JSRef builds a library or DLL containing the JavaScript runtime (compiler,
interpreter, decompiler, garbage collector, atom manager, standard classes).&nbsp;
The LiveConnect project/makefiles build a library that links both with
JSRef and with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that implements the Java Native
Interface (JNI), as specified by JavaSoft.&nbsp; It then compiles a small
"shell" program and links that with the library to make an interpreter
that can be used interactively and with test scripts.

<H2>
Compatibility</H2>
Unlike this release, all previous versions of LiveConnect appeared only
as a component of Netscape Navigator, not as a standalone module.&nbsp;
The variants of LiveConnect that appeared in Navigator versions 3.x and
4.x all behave much the same, modulo bugs.&nbsp; For brevity we refer to
this classic version of LiveConnect as "LC1" and this most recent release
as "LC2".&nbsp; The following incompatibilities with LC1 are known:
<UL>
<LI>
As in LC1, JavaScript objects appear to Java as instances of <I>netscape.javascript.JSObject</I>.&nbsp;
In LC1, two <I>JSObject</I>'s could be tested for equality, i.e. to see
if they refer to the same instance, by using the `==' operator.&nbsp; Instead,
developers must now use the <TT>equals()</TT>method of <I>netscape.javascript.JSObject</I>
for comparison, a method that overrides <TT>java.lang.Object.equals()</TT>.&nbsp;
Using <TT>equals()</TT> instead of `==' should work the same on both LC1
and LC2.&nbsp;<BR>
<BR>
It is not possible to replicate the identity behavior of the `==' operator
that LC1 provides without the use of "weak" references, i.e. references
that do not contribute to making a Java object reachable for purposes of
garbage collection, but which nonetheless allow reference to an object
as long as it is reachable by other means.&nbsp; The use of weak references
is not portable, however.&nbsp; It is not part of the JNI or the JDK and
it is not provided on all JVMs.&nbsp; The JDK1.2 release will include standard
support for weak references.<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
It's possible that, in a set of overloaded Java methods, more than one
is compatible with the types of the actual arguments in a call from JavaScript
via LiveConnect.&nbsp; LC1 resolved these ambiguities in a simplistic manner,
by simply invoking whatever method was enumerated first by the JVM.&nbsp;
The enumeration order of reflected methods using <I>java.lang.reflect</I>&nbsp;
is not specified by Sun and may differ among vendor's JVMs, i.e. enumeration
could be in order of classfile appearance, hashtable order, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
With the Netscape and Sun JVMs, it is possible to change the behavior of
an LC1 program by changing the order that Java methods appear in a source
file, thus changing the method enumeration order.&nbsp; Hence, the Java
method chosen when there is more than one compatible method may vary depending
on the JVM.<BR>
<BR>
A future release of LiveConnect will provide a new algorithm for overloaded
Java method resolution that is both independent of the JVM used and more
likely than LC1 to invoke the method that the developer expects.<BR>
<BR></LI>

<LI>
There are several minor changes in error handling to make LiveConnect more
conformant to ECMAScript.&nbsp; These include, for example, making any
attempt to delete JavaObject, JavaClass or JavaPackage properties fail
silently, rather than causing an error.&nbsp; Also, some error messages
have been changed to be more informative.&nbsp; These changes should generally
be backward-compatible with LC1 because few programs that use LiveConnect
will depend on the exact behavior of LiveConnect when handling errors.</LI>
</UL>

<H2>
New Features</H2>
Several minor features have been added to this release of LiveConnect.&nbsp;
These features were not available in the versions of LiveConnect that were
integrated with Netscape Naviagtor versions 4.x and earlier.
<BR>&nbsp;
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>
The Java methods of <I>java.lang.Object</I> are now invokeable methods
of <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>JavaArray</FONT></TT> objects, matching the behavior
of arrays when accessed from Java<I>.</I>&nbsp; (Java arrays are a subclass
of <I>java.lang.Object</I>.) For example, Java's <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>getClass()</FONT></TT>
and <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>hashCode()</FONT></TT> methods can now be called
on <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>JavaArray</FONT></TT> objects.&nbsp; (In prior versions
of LiveConnect, the methods of <I>java.lang.Object</I> were only inherited
by non-array Java objects.)</LI>


<P>Note that this change has caused the string representation of JavaArray
objects to change.&nbsp; Previously, the JavaArray toString() method always
printed "<TT><FONT SIZE=+1>[object JavaArray]"</FONT></TT> for all <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>JavaArray</FONT></TT>'s.&nbsp;
Now, the Java <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>java.lang.Object.toString()</FONT></TT>
method is called to convert JavaArray objects to strings, just as with
other, non-array Java objects that are accessible via LiveConnect.&nbsp;
<TT><FONT SIZE=+1>java.lang.Object.toString()</FONT></TT>is defined in
the <I>Java Language Specification</I> to return the value of the following
expression:

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(hashCode())</FONT></TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
A one-character string is now an acceptable match for an argument to a
Java method of type <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>char</FONT></TT>.&nbsp; (In earlier
versions of LiveConnect, the only acceptable match for a <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>char</FONT></TT>
had to be a JavaScript value that was convertible to a number.)&nbsp; For
example, the following is now possible:</LI>


<P><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>c = new java.lang.Character("F")</FONT></TT>
<BR>&nbsp;
<LI>
A JavaClass object is now an acceptable match for an argument to a Java
method of type <I>java.lang.Class</I>.&nbsp; For example, you can now write:</LI>


<P><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(java.lang.String,
3)</FONT></TT>

<P>instead of the more verbose:

<P><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>jls = java.lang.Class.forName("java.lang.String")</FONT></TT>
<BR><TT><FONT SIZE=-1>java.lang.reflect.Array.newInstance(jls, 3)</FONT></TT>
<BR>&nbsp;</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>
Build conventions</H2>
Update your JVM's <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>CLASSPATH</FONT></TT> to point to the
<TT><FONT SIZE=+1>liveconnect/classes</FONT></TT> subdirectory.&nbsp; If
you do not, LiveConnect will still operate but with the limitation that
JS objects may not be passed as arguments of Java methods and it will not
be possible to call from Java into JavaScript, i.e. the <I>netscape.javascript.JSObject</I>
class will be inaccessible.&nbsp; Another downside of operating without
these classes is that Java error messages will not include a Java stack
trace, when one is available.&nbsp; If your <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>CLASSPATH</FONT></TT>
is set improperly, you will see a message like, "<TT><FONT SIZE=+1>initialization
error: Can't load class netscape/javascript/JSObject</FONT></TT>" when
starting a LiveConnect debug build.

<P>By default, LiveConnect is not re-entrant.&nbsp; To enable multi-threaded
execution, define the <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>JS_THREADSAFE</FONT></TT> cpp macro
and flesh out the stubs and required headers in jslock.c/.h.&nbsp; See
the JS API docs for more.&nbsp; JSRef must also be built with <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>JS_THREADSAFE</FONT></TT>.

You must first build the JS runtime, js32.dll, by using the normal JSRef
build procedure.</LI>

<LI>
Identify the JVM that you are linking against by setting the <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>JDK</FONT></TT>
environment variable to point to the top-level JDK directory, e.g. <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>D:\jdk1.1.5</FONT></TT>.&nbsp;
This is used to establish paths for header file inclusion, linking and
execution.&nbsp; If you are not using Sun's JVM, the project files may
require manual tweaking to set these paths correctly.</LI>

<LI>
The output files (DLLs and executables) are placed in the <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>js/ref/liveconnect/Debug</FONT></TT>
or <TT><FONT SIZE=+1>js/ref/liveconnect/Release</FONT></TT> directories.</LI>

<H2>
Naming and coding conventions:</H2>

<UL>
<LI>
Public function names begin with JSJ_ followed by capitalized "intercaps",&nbsp;
e.g. JSJ_ConnectToJavaVM.</LI>

<LI>
Extern but library-private function names use a jsj_ prefix and mixed case,
e.g. jsj_LookupSymbol.</LI>

<LI>
Most static function names have unprefixed, underscore-separated names:
get_char.</LI>

<LI>
But static native methods of JS objects have intercaps names, e.g., JavaObject_getProperty().</LI>

<LI>
And library-private and static data use underscores, not intercaps (but
library-private data do use a js_ prefix).</LI>

<LI>
Scalar type names are lowercase and js-prefixed: jsdouble.</LI>

<LI>
Aggregate type names are JS-prefixed and mixed-case: JSObject.</LI>

<LI>
Macros are generally ALL_CAPS and underscored, to call out potential side
effects, multiple uses of a formal argument, etc.</LI>

<LI>
Four spaces of indentation per statement nesting level.&nbsp; The files
are space-filled, so adjusting of your tab setting should be unnecessary.</LI>

<LI>
DLL entry points have their return type expanded within a PR_PUBLIC_API()&nbsp;
macro call, to get the right Windows secret type qualifiers in the right
places for both 16- and 32-bit builds.</LI>

<LI>
Callback functions that might be called from a DLL are similarly macroized
with PR_STATIC_CALLBACK (if the function otherwise would be static to hide
its name) or PR_CALLBACK (this macro takes no type argument; it should
be used after the return type and before the function name).</LI>

<H2>
The LiveConnect API</H2>
All public LiveConnect entry points and callbacks are documented in jsjava.h,
the header file that exports those functions.
