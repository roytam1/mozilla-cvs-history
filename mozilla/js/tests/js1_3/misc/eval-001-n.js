/**
 *  File Name:          eval-001.js
 *  Description:
 *
 *  For JavaScript 1.4:
 *
 *  The global eval function may not be accessed indirectly and then called.
 *  This feature will continue to work in JavaScript 1.3 but will result in an
 *  error in JavaScript 1.4. This restriction is also in place for the With and
 *  Closure constructors.
 *
 *  In this test, the indirect call to eval should succeed.
