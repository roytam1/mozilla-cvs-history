jsPerformance.pl is an adaptation by mazielobo@netscape.com
of the JS Engine test driver (jsDriver.pl by rginda@netscape.com).

Whereas jsDriver.pl runs qualitative tests with pass-fail output,
jsPerformance.pl runs performance tests, with timing output.

The driver outputs results files as peers to the test driver, and like
jsDriver.pl, expects tests to be in a directory structure two levels deep.

Additionally, jsPerformance.pl will post results to a server for logging
purposes, if you have an appropriate CGI script to receive the results.

The CGI script we used was http://jrgm.mcom.com/cgi-bin/jsperf/collect.cgi.
This was adapted from John Morrison's loader.pl script (jrgm@netscape.com.).

Note: the call to send_results_to_server() is currently commented out.
If you have a CGI script and want to post results to it, uncomment it.
