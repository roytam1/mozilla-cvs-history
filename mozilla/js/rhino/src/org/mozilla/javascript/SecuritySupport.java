/**
 * This class describes the support needed to implement security.
 * <p>
 * Three main pieces of functionality are required to implement
 * security for JavaScript. First, it must be possible to define
 * classes with an associated security context. (This security 
 * context may be any object that has meaning to an embedding;
 * for a client-side JavaScript embedding this would typically
 * be an origin URL and/or a digital certificate.) Next it 
 * must be possible to get the current class context so that
 * the implementation can determine securely which class is
 * requesting a privileged action. And finally, it must be 
 * possible to map a class back into a security context so that
 * additional classes may be defined with that security context.
 * <p>
 * These three pieces of functionality are encapsulated in the
 * SecuritySupport class.
 *
 * @see org.mozilla.javascript.Context
 * @see java.lang.ClassLoader
