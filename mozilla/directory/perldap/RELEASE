VERSION 1.5.3 - Aug 2010
========================
This is an update release with the following goals:

   - Allow PerLDAP to use the OpenLDAP client libraries behind the
     scenes.
   - Avoid using deprecated functions in the underlying LDAP client
     library.

VERSION 1.5.2 - Jul 2007
========================

Fixes https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=389731
PerLDAP crashes when a bad URL is passed

VERSION 1.5.1 - May 2007
========================
This version is the officially tri-licensed version.  All code
is licensed under the MPL/GPL/LGPL tri-license, as all of the
other Mozilla components.  All code was either granted permission
by the copyright holder, or was rewritten in a clean-room
implementation.

VERSION 1.5 - Feb 2006
======================

This is an update release, with a few goals:

   - Support for latest Mozilla and Sun C-SDK (v5.x)
   - Now defaults to LDAP v3 protocol, but you can downgrade to v2 easily
   - Fully support Perl 5.005 and later
   - Added "hash" style prototypes to all class methods that takes more
     than one argument

Many, many thanks to Rich Megginson for taking charge of the (broken) build
and configuration process.


New functionality
-----------------

Conn.pm:
	* setVersion() - Set the LDAP protocol version
	* getVersion() - Get the current LDAP protocol in use
	* installNSPR() - Make the connection use NSPR I/O etc.
	* setNSPRTimeout() - Set the connection timeout, in ms

API.xs:
	* Added support for prldap_install_routines().



VERSION 1.4 - AUGUST 18, 1999
=============================

This is primarily a bug fix release, however there are 5 new methods
introduced as well.  Brief descriptions follow in this document.  To get
full examples and a larger summary, see the PerLDAP Programmer's Guide.


New Methods Added
-----------------

Entry.pm:
	* getValues() - returns the array of values.
	* move() - move one attribute to another, and delete the original.
	* copy() - copy one attribute to another.
	
Conn.pm:
	* browse() - makes it easy to browse an entry.
	* compare() - compare an attribute value against a DN/entry
		    without having to do the search.	


Bug Fixes and other changes
---------------------------

Entry.pm:
	* addDNValue() - fixed wrong index for norm.
	* matchValue() - fixed missing normalization in half of case statement. 
	* setValue() - remove _delete_ flag if set, fix for saving state.
	* STORE - fixed not ignoring the internal instance variables properly.
	* Fixed numerous bugs for large attribute sets.
	* Fixed bug 4368 ("exists vs. EXISTS").
	* Fixed several loop bugs.
	* Removed all _self_obj_  references, it's obsolete in this
	  version.
	* We support each() and keys() now on the Entry object, to loop
	  through all attribute names (types).


Conn.pm:
	* close() - fixed memory leak.
	* modifyRDN() - fixed problem where we weren't updating the
			appropriate DN in the self object.
	* Fixed bug 3342 (problems adding entries with binary data).
	* getErrorCode()/getErrorString() - return LDAP_SUCCESS if no
					    LDAP connection handle.
	* add() - fixed code to handle hash array as docs indicate.
	* update() - optimization for "replace" vs "add/delete", we try to
		     use whatever LDAPMod is most efficient.

LDIF.pm:

	* Complete rewrite, by John Kristian <kristian@netscape.com>.

API.xs:
	* Fixed memory allocation problems, replacing all memory management
	  routines. This solves all known issues with ActiveState Perl.
	* More safety checks around calls to *_free().

	
Miscellaneous
-------------

	* Various other optimizations on tests and such.
	* Fixed most (all?) known memory leaks.
	* Fixed a lot of problems with Makefile.PL, adding some new targets
	  (like "make html"). Add a skeleton to "make test".
	* Fixed numerous small bugs, as reported to Mozilla.
	* We produce less warnings now, and try to "use strict" when
	  appropriate.
	* We have a new versioning scheme, conforming to standard
	  Perl. We'll change this again when Perl's new versioning system
	  is in place (allowing versions like 1.2.3).
