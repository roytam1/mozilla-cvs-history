	* psoftsync.pl: New file, also merged in some modules from
	LdapUtils.pm, to make sure this works. NOTE: This script currently
	doesn't work, since all "modify" operations are horked.

	* tabdump.pl: Actually works!

	* ldappasswd.pl: Cleaned out some code, and moved it over to the
	::Utils module.
