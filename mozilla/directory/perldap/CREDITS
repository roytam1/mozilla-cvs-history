This is a short list of people that have contributed to the success of
this project.


* Leif Hedstrom <leif@perldap.org>

	- Project lead, v1.0 and v2.0.
	- Wrote some of the API code,  and most of OO layers (Conn.pm,
	  Entry.pm, Utils.pm, ACL.pm etc.)
	- Unix portability tests, and releases.
	- Port to Windows/NT and ActivePerl.


* Kevin McCarthy <kmccarth@perldap.org>

	- New maintainer of API.xs and API.pm
	- Bug fixes, tons of contribution, particularly to the API.xs file.

          modules for PerLDAP v2.0.


* John Kristian <kristian@netscape.com>

	- Rewrote the entire LDIF.pm module, which is a standalone LDIF
          module, which also integrates tightly with PerLDAP if desired.
