	* Utils.pm (unixCrypt): Moved from my LdapUtils.pm module.
	Added askPassword to the export tag.

	* Conn.pm (new): Added support for passing a hash array of all the
	parameters, as returned by the ldapArgs() function.

	* Utils.pm (str2Scope): New function, for converting strings
	(subtree) to a numerical scope value (2).
	(askPassword): Dito, ask for a password, interactively.
	(ldapArgs): Dito, handle common LDAP command line arguments.

	* Makefile.PL: Minor change, to do regex match on OS version for
	MSWin.

	* Entry.pm: Changed all _XXX hash values to also end with a _,
	hence making it easier to isolate them (/^_.*_$/).

	* Conn.pm (nextEntry): Changed to accept that the attributes are
	now arrays, not pointers to arrays. We still consider them as
	pointers internally though, it's cleaner API.

	* API.pm: Changed to use the native Exporter function to export
	tags into EXPORT_OK.
