1998-12-04  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Makefile.PL: Modified so that "silent" install will actually
	echo what options it's setting.
	It will now croak() if the SDK dir specified doesn't exist.

	* INSTALL: Updated to reflect new v1.1 stuff. Added links to the
	FAQ.

	* README: Dito. Also changed some of the binary install
	information, which might not be useful anyways...

	* Makefile.PL: Added "filters" to remove .dll and .sl from shared
	libraries when creating link options. I also replaced the code to
	put the valid library extensions into a variable (bug #1344).

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed some crap with the config parsing, and ENV
	handling (for silent installs).

1998-12-03  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (update): Bug fix, now we empty the hash array before
	examining changed attributes (bug #1385).

	* Makefile.PL: Added the "-nolinenumbers" XSUBS options (bug #1329).

1998-09-26  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

1998-09-18  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (init): Changed call to ldapssl_client_init() to pass a
	0 value as the handle pointer. This avoids a Perl compiler warning.

	* Utils.pm (ldapArgs): Bug fix, we used the wrong option for the

1998-09-11  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	still treat RDNs as CIS when comparing strings.

1998-09-08  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (setDefaultRebindProc): Bug fix, it had the Ldapc:: crap
	stil in there... :-(.

	* Makefile.PL: Fixed so that automated installs works.

	properly added to _oc_order_.
	(addValue): Dito, added the same code as for STORE.

	* Entry.pm (printLDIF): Copied/modified from the Utils.pm library.
	(isModified): Added this function, thought it might be useful.

1998-08-03  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (modifyRDN): Fixed! It also has an option to take an
	"external" DN as an argument, if supplied.

1998-08-02  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (getErrorCode): Now takes two optional arguments, to
	return the match string, and extra error string. Note that these
	two arguments are pointers to strings!

	* API.xs(ldap_get_lderrno): Fixed this function, at least it seems
	to work now...

	* Conn.pm (getLD): Added this function, convenient way to get the
	LD from the OO layer.

1998-07-30  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	to get credentials when binding as a user.

	* Conn.pm (new): Added support for passing a hash array of all the
	parameters, as returned by the ldapArgs() function.

	* Utils.pm (str2Scope): New function, for converting strings
	(subtree) to a numerical scope value (2).
	(askPassword): Dito, ask for a password, interactively.
	(ldapArgs): Dito, handle common LDAP command line arguments.

	* Makefile.PL: Minor change, to do regex match on OS version for
	MSWin.

	* Entry.pm: Changed all _XXX hash values to also end with a _,
	hence making it easier to isolate them (/^_.*_$/).

	* Conn.pm (nextEntry): Changed to accept that the attributes are
	now arrays, not pointers to arrays. We still consider them as
	pointers internally though, it's cleaner API.

	* API.pm: Changed to use the native Exporter function to export
	tags into EXPORT_OK.
