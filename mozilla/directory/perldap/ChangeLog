1999-01-06  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (nextEntry): Fixed (tried to fix...) the bug with
	missing attributes. I hope this will work, at a minimum I'm sure
	it won't hurt. The idea is to keep the case on the attribute type
	when requesting the values_len().

1999-01-11  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* API.xs: Added IF statements around all ldap_value_free() calls.

	normalization.

	makes any sense at all... :(

	avoide calling the TIEHASH methods.
	(update): Dito.
	(ALL): Clean out some "my" definitions.

	* Entry.pm (unRemove): New function, to undo remove opertaions on
	an attribute.

	from updating it properly in the Conn::update() method.
	(remove): Dito.

	it's zero if we don't find anything.

	* Entry.pm (FIRSTKEY): Modified to honor the oc_order.
	(NEXTKEY): Dito.
	(markModified): Made as an alias for attrModified().

	* Conn.pm (nextEntry): Added code to handle internal counters for
	number of attributes in oc_order. This is used/needed for the
	FIRSTKEY and NEXTKEY methods in the Entry/Tie::Hash object.

	* Entry.pm (isAttr): New method, to make sure an attribute name
	really is a valid LDAP attribute.

1998-12-04  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Makefile.PL: Modified so that "silent" install will actually
	echo what options it's setting.
	It will now croak() if the SDK dir specified doesn't exist.

	* INSTALL: Updated to reflect new v1.1 stuff. Added links to the
	FAQ.

	* README: Dito. Also changed some of the binary install
	information, which might not be useful anyways...

	handling (for silent installs).

1998-09-18  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (init): Changed call to ldapssl_client_init() to pass a
	0 value as the handle pointer. This avoids a Perl compiler warning.

	* LDIF.pm (readEntries): Changed tests for empty arguments, to use
	defined().

	* Utils.pm (ldapArgs): Bug fix, we used the wrong option for the
	certificate (-P) when checking to set the LDAP port.

	still treat RDNs as CIS when comparing strings.

1998-09-08  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (setDefaultRebindProc): Bug fix, it had the Ldapc:: crap
	stil in there... :-(.

	"external" DN as an argument, if supplied.

1998-08-02  Leif Hedstrom  <leif@netscape.com>

	* Conn.pm (getErrorCode): Now takes two optional arguments, to
	return the match string, and extra error string. Note that these
	two arguments are pointers to strings!

	* API.xs(ldap_get_lderrno): Fixed this function, at least it seems
	to work now...

	* Conn.pm (getLD): Added this function, convenient way to get the
	LD from the OO layer.

	hence making it easier to isolate them (/^_.*_$/).

	* Conn.pm (nextEntry): Changed to accept that the attributes are
	now arrays, not pointers to arrays. We still consider them as
	pointers internally though, it's cleaner API.

	* API.pm: Changed to use the native Exporter function to export
	tags into EXPORT_OK.
