INTRODUCTION
============

PerlDAP (also known as Mozilla::LDAP) allows Perl programmers to develop
software that leverages directories supporting the Lightweight Directory
Access Protocol (LDAP).

Version 1.0 provides both object oriented and direct methods of access
for all LDAP version 2 operations.  Experimental direct access is also
included for version 3 operations.

Numerous examples and test applications are provided to help developers
quickly understand and utilize this module.
