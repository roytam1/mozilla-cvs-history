<P>
This memo is an outline of where I think PerLDAP should evolve in the near
future. I'm dividing this into three phases, the next bug fix release
(v1.1), the next minor release (v1.5?), and the next major release
(v2.0). This doesn't mean we'll actually end up doing exactly those
releases, but I'm considering them to be the three important milestones in
this products foresable future.
</P>

<P>
This document is work in progress, and will be updated regularly. It will
be also used (at least for now) to track outstanding issues, and things
that needs to be done. I hope to collect feedback and bug reports from the
Open Source community, and this document will be the "live" document for
this effort.

PerLDAP v1.0 was release on August 18, with a set of known problems. This
was done intentionally, to meet the deadline for the Perl conference in
San Jose, August 1998. There's been very few bug reports this far, the one
oustanding issue (which I already knew about before RTM) is the
incompatibility with the C SDK from mozilla.org. Code to handle this will
be added asap, we have the bulk already written in the previous (in-house)
LDAP module.

The next release, which we should aim to have finished by no later than
September 30, is primarily a bug fix release. It shouldn't add any new
features, unless they can be considered "bugs" (i.e. a features so
important that a module or method doesn't work without it). The oustanding
(known) problems we must address are:

    <LI>Memory usage is very high, for some reason it's more memory
    intensive than my old code (why?).

    <LI><B>Makefile.PL</B>: We must to support both DevEdge and
    mozilla.org SDK libraries. I'm suggesting we'll merge (and adapt) the
    old code from my original Makefile.PL script, which tries to find the
    libldap files more "intelligently".

    <LI><B>Conn.pm</B>: The delete() method does not work as documented,
    it should handle taking an Entry:: object as argument. Reported by 
    Thomas Lockney <tlockney@tivoli.com>. <B><I>[leif]</I></B>

    <LI><B>Conn.pm</B>: On line 399, the "$del = 1 if ..." needs to check if
    $del is defined or not, or the strict parsing will complain. Reported
    by James Briggs <briggsja@netscape.com>. There's a few of these in the
    code, I tried to fix as many as possible before shipping v1.0, some
    were still left... We should change all such occurences, and add tests
    using "if defined()". <B><I>[leif]</I></B>

    <LI><B>Conn.pm</B>: Bug fix for case sensitivity on searches for
    specific attributes. <B><I>[leif, fixed 09/03]</I></B>

    <B><I>[leif, fixed 09/11]</I></B>

    <LI><B>Makefile.PL</B>: Change all "reads" from STDIN to explictly use
    <STDIN>. This is necessary so the user can give extra command line
    arguments to pass to MakeMaker. We might want to consider a major
    rewrite of this on the overhaul of Makefile.PL. <B><I>[leif, fixed

    compare to see that they are identical. This requires the changes
    proposed earlier to the write() methods.

<P>
Following the first bug fix release, we should do a minor enhancement
release. This would incorporate important missing features that we know of
today, and new features requested by peers. This should be done without
major rewrite of any existing code, i.e. we'd only add a feature if it can
be done without affecting the overall stability and architecture of the
software. I see this as the incremental evolvement of the v1.0 release.
</P>

<P>
It might be to optmistic, but I think we should aim for a v1.5 release no
later than Q1 of 1999. We might also have to do a v1.6 bug fix release, as
a followup on new features etc.

    <LI>Update API with whatever changes are made to the C SDK in the
    final RTM release (SDK v3.0 is still beta).

    <LI>Can't compile with CygWin tools on Win/NT.

    <LI>Go trough some of the commonly used options and arguments used
    with the OO methods, and see what can be made easier. For instance, a
    very typical search is to set the DN to a base-DN, and search for
    (objectclass=*). This should be simplified, perhaps even have it's own
    method.

    <LI><B>Conn.pm</B>: Support for the "none" search attribute list,
    i.e. ("1.1"). We should also add support for an "all" list.

    <LI><B>Conn.pm</B>: Support for the manageDSAIT control mechanism, to make
    it possible to modify smart referrals for instance.

    <LI>Examine the possibility to use asynchronous LDAP, which should
    reduce the memory usage as well (particularly for large
    databases/searches). If this is too complicated, it will have
    to wait until v2.0. <B><I>[leif]</I></B>

    <LI><B>Conf.pm</B>: Add a global configuration module, which (once
    configured) will make it easier to get default LDAP parameters
    (e.g. base-DN, server, port etc).

    <LI><B>Conn.pm</B>: Add support for SASL. This might require a

    flexible but still backward compatible.

I have no clear idea right now where the next version should go. For now,
I'm using this mostly as a place holder for features, enhancments and
extensions that I don't think we can finish in the v1.5 time frame.
