              iPlanet LDAP SDK for C, version 5.0
=================================================================
 
Documentation for this release of the LDAP SDK for C is located
at the following URL: 

   http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/directory.html#SDKC

The documentation set includes the "Release Notes" (in HTML
format) and the "Netscape LDAP SDK for C Programmer's Guide."
The Programmer's Guide is available in PDF and HTML formats.

Please note that the LDAP SDK for C library is most of the time
ahead of our official documentation.  For example, we currently 
don't have a 5.0 branded version of the documentation, however,
using the latest 4.1 version should be sufficient.
