Welcome to the Gecko Plaintext Editor.

This entire body is in a &lt;PRE&gt; tag, wrapped to 72 columns.  Eventually we want to do this through a style sheet (see bug 4696).

Typed text will wrap to the current wrap setting.  You can increase or decrease the wrap setting by typing alt-] or alt-[; you can see the current wrap column setting by typing alt-C.
