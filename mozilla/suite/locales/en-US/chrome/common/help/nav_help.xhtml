<p>&nbsp;</p> <a NAME="nav_view"></a> <h2>Viewing Your Home Page</h2>
<p>When you start Mozilla, you see Navigator, your browser. A
&quot;welcome&quot; page entitled "Getting Involved with Mozilla"
appears automatically in the browser window when you first launch
Mozilla. This page welcomes you to the Mozilla community and tells you
more about Mozilla. It has information on how you can report problems
you find, and how you can participate in improving Mozilla. Suggested
examples of this include contributing documentation, finding bugs,
fixing bugs, and contributing new code.


<p>Until you specify otherwise, this page is your home page. To choose
 your own home page, see <a
 href="chrome://help/locale/customize_help.html#cust_startpage">Specifying
 How Mozilla Starts Up</a>.

<p>When you view web pages in Navigator, some pages are divided into
rectangular areas called frames. Each frame can display other pages.

<p>There are two ways to view more than one webpage
simultaneously. The method most familiar to many people is opening a
new window. To do this, open the File menu and choose New Navigator
Window. At first the new window displays a copy of your home page, but
you can use it to view a different page. The second way to accomplish
this is to use a new feature available in Mozilla called "Tabbed
Browsing." You are now able to open sub-windows or "tabs" within a
single window. To open a new tab, press Control T or open the File
menu and choose New | Navigator Tab. You will now see a second "tab"
next to the original window you had open. Type in an address, such as
www.mozilla.org in the location bar above the tab, to have the website
corresponding with that website open in the open tab. The number of
tabs you can open is only limited by the system resources available to
you.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="nav_move"></a> 
<h2>Moving to Another Page</h2>
<p>You move to a new page by typing its URL&#151;its location (address) on the Web. 
  URLs normally begin with the abbreviation "http://," followed by one or more 
  names that identify the address. For instance, "http://netscape.com"</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Click the Location Bar to select the URL that is already there. 
  
<li>Type the URL of the page you want to visit. The URL you type replaces any 
    text already in the Location Bar. 
  
<li>Press Enter. 
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: To quickly select the URL in the Location Bar, press Ctrl+L.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Don't know a URL?</b> You can type part of a URL, such as "cnn" (for www.cnn.com); 
  or you can type a general word, such as "gifts" or "flowers." Navigator guesses 
  what page you want to view, or displays a page with a choice of links related 
  to the word you typed.</p>
<p> [&nbsp;<A HREF="#nav_first">Return to beginning of section</A>&nbsp;] </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a NAME="nav_link"></a> 
<h2>Clicking a Link</h2>
<p>Most web pages contain links you can click to move to other pages.</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Move the pointer until it changes to a pointing finger. This happens whenever 
    the pointer is over a link. Most links are underlined text, but buttons and 
    pictures can also be links.</li>
<li>Click the link once. While the network locates the page that the link points 
    to, status messages appear at the bottom of the window.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Retracing Your Steps</h2>
<p>There are several ways to re-visit pages:</p>
<ul>
  
<li>To go back or forward one page, click the Back or Forward arrow. 
  
<li>To go back or forward more than one page, click the small triangles on the 
    Back and Forward buttons. You'll see a list of pages you've visited; to return 
    to a page, choose it from the list.

<h3><a name="web_pages:historyIDX"></a><a name="history:windowIDX"></a>About  
  History Lists</h3>
<p>The history list contains links to recently visited pages.The Location Bar list contains links to pages you've typed into the Location Bar and then visited.</p>
<p>To access the history list from Navigator. Open the Task menu, choose Tools, then History. To access the Location Bar list, click the 
    arrow at the right end of the Location Bar.</p>
<p><b>Tip</b>: To quickly open the history list, press Ctrl+H.</p>
<p>If you don't want the Location Bar or history list to display the pages you've 
  been visiting, you can clear the history list and Location Bar history entirely or selectively.</p>
<p>To delete all pages from the Location Bar or history list, begin from the Navigator window:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Navigator category, click History. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>Click Clear History and Clear Location Bar to remove all previously visited 
    web pages from the lists. 
  
<li>If you wish to set a limit on how many pages remain in the history list, 
    click the field next to "Number of pages in session history" and type a number of pages. 
</ol>
<p>To selectively delete pages from the history list, do any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>To delete all pages from a domain, select a page within that domain (folder) in the History list, open the Edit menu, and select &quot;Delete entire domain <i>[domain name]</i>.&quot; For example, use this command if  you want to delete all pages that end in &quot;netscape.com.&quot;</li>
<li>To delete pages from a subdomain, select a page within that subdomain in the History list, open the Edit menu, and select &quot;Delete all from <i>[subdomain]</i>.&quot;  For example, use this command if you want to delete all pages from   &quot;health.netscape.com&quot; but not &quot;netscape.com.&quot;</li>
<li>To delete a single page, select a page in the history list and press Delete.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tip</b>: To sort the history list, click one of the categories (Title, Location, 
  or Last Visited). Click the title again to reverse the order. </p>

<h2>Visiting Bookmarked Pages</h2>
<p>The addresses, or URLs, of web pages can be quite long and difficult to remember. 
  Fortunately, it's not necessary to memorize URLs in order to browse the Web. 
  Your browser has a list of bookmarks, which are pointers to interesting web 
  pages. </p>
<p>To go to a bookmarked page, begin from the Navigator window:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Bookmarks menu. The menu contains bookmarks represented by a bookmark 
    icon, and folders that contain more bookmarks.</li>
<li>To visit a bookmarked page, choose a bookmark from the menu, or open a folder 
    and choose a bookmark.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Tip</b>: To retrace your steps, click the Back arrow. 
<p>You can save your own bookmarks to point to pages you frequently visit, or 
  to other interesting places on the Web. See <a href="customize_help.html#cust_bkmk_create">Creating 
  New Bookmarks</a> for more information.</p>

<h2>Using My Sidebar</h2>
<p>In addition to navigating the Web with Navigator, you can let the Web come 
  to you by using My Sidebar.</p>
<p>My Sidebar is a customizable frame in your browser where you can keep items 
  that you need to use all the time&#151;the latest news and weather, your address 
  book or Buddy List, stock quotes, a calendar&#151;and many other options you can 
  choose. My Sidebar presents these items to you in tabs that it continually updates.</p>
<p>Mozilla comes with some My Sidebar tabs already set up, but you can customize 
  My Sidebar by adding, removing, and rearranging tabs. For details, see <a href="customize_help.html#cust_sidebar">My 
  Sidebar</a>.</p>

<a NAME="nav_searchweb"></a> 
<h2>Fast Searches</h2>
<p>There are three ways to search quickly: from the Location Bar, from My Sidebar, 
  and from the Net Search page. <a NAME="searchfield"></a> 
<h3>Searching From the Location Bar</h3>
<p>Searching for web pages on a particular topic is as easy as typing a question, 
  or just a word or two, into the browser's Location Bar, as pictured below.</p>
<p><img src="images/search.gif" width="334" height="33" alt="Location Bar with Search Term"></p>
<p>For example, if you want to find information about baby dolls:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Double-click in the Location Bar to select the current text. 
  
<li>Type the word "baby doll". Your typing replaces the current text. 
</ol>
<p>Perform one of these steps:</p>
<ul>
  
<li>Click the Search button.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Search Netscape Search for &quot;baby doll&quot; at the bottom 
    of the drop-down list in the Location Bar. (You default search engine may 
    be different.)<br>
    The default search engine you choose in <a href="#Smart">Preferences</a> 
    is used. Search results for "baby doll" appear in both the browser window 
    and in My Sidebar. Click the links to visit web pages about baby dolls. </li>
</ul>
<p>After you perform a search, the results are saved in My Sidebar's Search tab 
  until you do a new search. You don't have to click the Back button to retrieve 
  the search results.</p>
<p>To save the results of a search, click &quot;Bookmark this Search&quot; in My Sidebar. To return to the 
  list later, open the Bookmarks menu. You'll find the search results in a folder 
  at the bottom of the Bookmarks menu.
<p>Note: You can also use Internet Keywords to search from the <a href="#nav_keywords">Location Bar</a>. <a NAME="searchsb"></a> <a name="My_Sidebar:searching_fromIDX"></a> 
<h3>Searching From My Sidebar</h3>
<p>The My Sidebar Search tab lets you quickly search and bookmark your search 
  results. For example, if you want to find information about toy cars:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>If it is not already open, open My Sidebar by clicking its handle. 
  
<li>Click the Search tab. 
  
<li>Open the "using" drop-down list, and choose a search engine. 
  
<li>Type "toy car" in the search field. 
  
<li>Click Search. Search results for 'toy car' appear in both the browser window 
    and in My Sidebar. Click the links to visit web pages about toy cars. 
</ol>
<p><b>Note</b>: If the My Sidebar Search tab contains a list of search engines from which to 
  choose, then it is set to search in Advanced mode and you will have to choose one or more search engines before clicking Search. You can keep it that way 
  or change to a basic setting in Preferences. 
<p>To save the results of a search from My Sidebar, click the Bookmark this Search 
  button. To return to the list later, open the Bookmarks menu. Your search results 
  appear in one of the folders in your list of bookmarks<a name="search:using_the_Search_buttonIDX">.</a> 
<h3>Searching From the Net Search page</h3>
<p>The Net Search page lets you type in a Search term or phrase, or explore several 
  categories (such as Arts & Entertainment, Business, and many more) that may 
  interest you. To visit the Net Search page, perform one of these steps:</p>
<ul>
  
<li>Click on the Search button <img src="images/search_personal_toolbar.gif" width="66" height="20"> 
    on the Personal Toolbar. 
  
<li>Open the Search menu and choose Search the Web. 
</ul>
<p> [&nbsp;<A HREF="#nav_search">Return to beginning of section</A>&nbsp;] </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="search:Advanced_modeIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_smartsearch"></a> 
<h2>Advanced Search Mode</h2>
<p>You can set the My Sidebar Search tab to Advanced mode, which lets you narrow 
  a search or choose one or more search engines.</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Navigator category, click Internet Search. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>Under My Sidebar Search Preferences, click Advanced, and then OK. 
  
<li>If it is not already open, open My Sidebar by clicking its handle. 
  
<li>Click the Search tab in My Sidebar. 
  
<li>Open the "within" drop-down list, and choose a category (such as music or 
    shopping).</li>
<li>Choose one or more search engines for the selected category. 
  
<li>In the search field, type the word for which you want to search.</li>
<li>Click Search.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp; <img src="images/searchmusic.gif" HSPACE="0" VSPACE="0" alt="My Side Bar Search on Madonna"> 
</p>
<p>To save the results of a search, click the &quot;Bookmark this Search&quot; 
  button. To return to the list later, Open the Bookmarks menu. Your search results 
  appear in one of the folders in your list of bookmarks. <a name="My_Sidebar:search_categoriesIDX"></a> 
<h3>Customizing Search Categories</h3>
<p>You can specify which search engines should be used for different categories 
  of searches. For example, you can select one set of search engines to search 
  for travel, and select another set of search engines to search for software.</p>
<ol>
  
<li> Set My Sidebar Search to Advanced Search Mode. See <a href="#nav_smartsearch">Advanced 
    Search mode</a> for details. 
  
<li>If it is not already open, open My Sidebar by clicking its handle. 
  
<li>Click the Search tab in My Sidebar. 
  
<li>Open the "within" drop-down list, click &quot;Edit Categories&quot;. You 
    see the Edit Categories dialog box. 
  
<li>From the Categories drop-down list, choose the category you want to customize.<br>
    Or<br>
    To create a new category, click New and type a name for the category. The 
    drop-down list displays the name of the selected category. 
  
<li>Do one of the following: </li>

<ul>
<li>To add a search engine for the selected category, highlight the search engine 
    in the list on the left, and click Add. </li>
<li>To remove a search engine for the selected category, highlight the engine 
    in the list on the right, and click Remove. </li>
<li>To rename the selected category, click Rename and type a new name. </li>
<li>To delete the selected category, click Delete. </li>
</ul>

<li>Click OK when you are finished customizing. </li>

<a name="bookmarks:boomarking_search_resultsIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_savesearch"></a> 
<h2>Bookmarking Search Results</h2>
<p>To save your search results as bookmarks, begin from the Navigator window: 
<ol>
  
<li>Perform a search from the <a href="#searchfield">Location Bar</a> or from 
    the <a href="#searchsb">My Sidebar Search tab</a>. 
  
<li>After the search results are displayed in My Sidebar, click &quot;Bookmark 
    this Search&quot; in the My Sidebar Search tab. 
  
<li>Open the Bookmarks menu. Your search results appear in one of the folders 
    in your list of bookmarks. For instance, if you searched for "toy car," your 
    bookmark list contains a folder labeled "Search: 'toy car'" containing bookmarks 
    for web pages about toy cars. 
</ol>
<p> [&nbsp;<A HREF="#nav_search">Return to beginning of section</A>&nbsp;] </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="search:setting_preferencesIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_searchprefs"></a> 
<h2>Setting Search Preferences</h2>
<p>By default, when you click Search, the <a href="http://home.netscape.com/escapes/search/tips_0.html" target="_blank">Netscape 
  Search search engine</a> is used. You can choose a different search engine as 
  the default. You can also specify how you want search results displayed in My 
  Sidebar.</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Navigator category, click Internet Search. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>Under Default Search Engine, choose a search engine you want to use for 
    web searching. 
  
<li>Under Search Results, select &quot;Open the Search tab in My Sidebar when 
    search results are available&quot; if you want the My Sidebar search tab to 
    open and show your search results. 
  
<li>Under My Sidebar Search Tab Preference, select Basic if you want to search 
    using a single search engine, or select Advanced to be able to search using 
    multiple search engines. 
</ol>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="Internet_Keywords:using_Internet_KeywordsIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_keywords"></a> 
<h2>Using Internet Keywords</h2>
<p>Internet Keywords work with the Location Bar to help you quickly find specific 
  types of information. There are several ways to use Internet Keywords:</p>
<ul>
  
<li>Type a specific product, trademark, or company name and press Enter (Return 
    on Mac OS), to go directly to a company's web site. 
  
<li>Type certain verbs, such as "shop" or "quote," followed by the word you 
    want to look up, to get specific information. For instance, "shop pets" takes 
    you to a page with links to online pet stores. 
  
<li>Type the name of a city or town followed by certain words such as "movies" 
    or "restaurants," for local information. For instance, type "san francisco 
    restaurants". 
</ul>
<p><b>Hint:</b> The most commonly used Internet Keywords are listed in the pull-down 
  list to the left of the Location Bar. Click the triangle and choose from the 
  list. To see a longer list of keywords, choose List of Keywords.</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> To use Internet Keywords, you must press Enter on your keyboard 
  (Return on Mac OS) instead of clicking the Search button. Pressing Enter activates 
  the Internet Keyword feature; clicking Search initiates a search.</p>
<p>To see the difference, try this: 
<ol>
  
<li>Type "apple imac" into the Location Bar and press Enter (Return). Apple 
    Computer's iMac Web page appears. 
  
<li>Now type "apple imac" into the Location Bar and click Search. You see a 
    list of links related to Apple Computer's iMac models. 
</ol>
<p>If typing Internet Keywords into the Location Bar is not working for you, check 
  your <a href="cs_nav_prefs_navigator.html#nav_smartbrowse">Smart Browsing preferences</a> to be sure the 
  Internet Keywords feature is enabled.</p>
<h3>Quick Stock Quotes</h3>
<p>To see a recent stock quote for a company, type "quote" followed by the company's 
  stock ticker symbol, and press Enter.</p>
<p>If you don't know a company's stock ticker symbol, type the company's name. 
  The quote page will list all companies with similar names, and you can choose 
  the one for which you want a quote.</p>

    school&#151;such as netscape.com or un.org. 
  
<li>Under Internet Keywords, deselect "Enable Internet Keywords."
</ol>
<p>What's Related works by gathering information on the browsing habits of a huge

<h2>Selecting Character Codings and Fonts</h2>
<p>If you browse, compose, or send and receive email in more than one language, 
  you need to select the appropriate character codings and fonts.</p>
<p>A character coding method is the way a document or message has been converted 
  to data to be used by your computer. All web documents and mail and news messages 
  use a character coding method (also known as a character encoding or character 
  set).</p>
<p>The character coding method for a document depends on its language. Some languages&#151;such 
  as most of the Western languages&#151;share the same coding method. Others, such 
  as Chinese, Japanese, and Russian, use different methods.</p>
<p>Your version of Mozilla is set to a default character coding appropriate 
  for your region. However, if you use more than one language you may need to 
  select appropriate character coding methods and designate the fonts you wish 
  to use for your coding method.</p>
<p>To select character codings, begin from the Navigator window: 
<ol>
  
<li>Open the View menu, choose Character Coding, and then choose More. </li>
<li>Choose a region from the top section of the submenu. 
    </li>
<li>Choose a character coding within the region submenu. Repeat steps 1-3 for each character coding method you want. </li>
</ol>
<p>The character coding methods you select are added to the Character Coding menu. 
  If you have more than one coding method selected, the active one has a bullet 
  (dot) next to it. 
<p>Mozilla can detect which character coding a document uses, and can display 
  it correctly on your screen. To take advantage of this capability, begin from the Navigator window: 
<ol>
  
<li>Open the View menu, choose Character Coding, and then choose Auto-Detect. 
  
<li>Choose one of the Auto-Detect options, or choose Auto-Detect Off from the 
    submenu. 
</ol>
<p>To make changes to your list of active character sets: 
<ol>
  
<li>Open the View menu, choose Character Coding, and then choose Customize. 
    You can see the Customize Coding dialog box. 
  
<li>Choose from the following procedures: 
    
<ul>
      
<li>To add to the list of active character sets, choose a character set 
        from the list on the left and click Add. 
      
<li>To remove a character set from the active list, choose a character set 
        from the list on the right and click Remove. 
      
<li>To change the order in which the browser checks for character sets, 
        highlight character sets in the list on the right, and use the arrow buttons 
        to move the character sets up or down in the list. 
    
</ul>
</ol>
<p>To change the default fonts within a language group:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Appearance category, click Fonts. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>From the "Fonts for" drop-down list, choose a character coding method. For 
    instance, to set default fonts for the Western character set, choose "Western." 
  
<li>Select whether proportional text should be serif (like Times Roman) or sansserif 
    (like Arial). You can also specify what font size you want for proportional 
    text. Proportional text varies in width. 
  
<li>(If available) Select a font for Serif, Sans-Serif, Cursive, and Fantasy. 
  
<li>Select the monospace font (like Courier) that you want to use for web pages. 
    Monospace text is fixed in width, so each character or letter takes the same 
    amount of space. 
</ol>
<p>Many web page authors choose their own fonts and font sizes. You can use the 
  author's font settings by selecting "Allow documents to use other fonts."</p>
<p>To adjust the readability of fonts, select from the drop-down list the dots 
  per inch (dpi) for displaying Web pages. Select &quot;Other&quot; to open the 
  Calibrate Resolution dialog box, which allows you to calibrate your resolution 
  by measuring how long a line appears on your screen.<br>

<h2>Setting Language Preferences</h2>
<p>The language you use for Mozilla affects the text of buttons, dialog boxes, 
  menus, tools, and other items. The functionality of these items remains the 
  same. </p>
<p>To set your preferred language:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Click on the Appearance category. 
  
<li>Use the &quot;Choose your preferred language for Mozilla&quot; drop-down 
    list to select the language that you want to use in Mozilla. 
  
<li>Click OK. 
    
<p><b>Note</b>: You must restart Mozilla after you change your preferred 
      language.</p>
</ol>
<p>The content pack you use affects the home page, bookmarks, toolbar contents, 
  My Sidebar, and other items.</p>
<p>To use a content pack:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. </li>
<li>Under the Appearance category, click  Content Packs. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) </li>
<li>Under &quot;Installed Content Packs&quot; select a content pack. </li>
<li>Click OK. 
    
<p><b>Note</b>: You will have to need to restart Mozilla after you change 
      to another content pack. To download more content packs for Mozilla, click &quot;Download 
      More&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Web pages are sometimes available in several languages. Mozilla presents 
  pages in the language you prefer, if it is available. You can specify the languages 
  you wish to see, in order of preference.</p>
<p>To set language preferences:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Navigator category, click Languages. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>Click Add. You see the Add Language dialog box. 
  
<li>Select a language and its code. If you wish to add a code not on the list, 
    type the language and its code in the Others field (see note, below). If you 
    want to reorder the languages in the list, select a language and click Move 
    Up or Move Down. 
  
<li>Click OK. 
</ol>
<p><b>Note:</b> Two-letter codes enclosed in brackets appear next to each language 
  in the list. These are standard abbreviations for languages. For a complete

<h2>Managing Different File Types</h2>
<p>Navigator can handle many types of files. However, for some files, such as 
  movies, Navigator launches a "helper" application that can handle the file, 
  or it saves the file for you to view later.</p>
<p>The settings in the Helper Applications preferences panel tell Navigator which 
  helper applications to use on your computer. You probably don't need to change 
  them because they come preconfigured. Also, if Navigator doesn't know which 
  helper application to use, it allows you to find helper applications within 
  the download dialog box. </p>
<p>The download dialog box has these options:</p>
<ul>
  
<li><b>Open using</b>: Mozilla opens the file using the default program in 
    your system settings. </li>
<li><b>Choose</b>: Mozilla allows you to open the file using an application 
    you choose.</li>
<li><b>Save this file to Disk</b>: Mozilla allows you to select a location 
    to save the file.</li>
<li><b>Always ask before opening this type of file</b>: When this is selected, 
    Mozilla opens the download dialog box when downloading a particular file 
    type. You can reset these choices afterwards in <a href="cs_nav_prefs_navigator.html#Helper">preferences for Helper Applications</a>.</li>
<li><b>Advanced</b>: Mozilla allows you to fine-tune how files are handled. 
    See &quot;<a href="#new_app">To add a new helper application to the list</a>&quot; 
    for details.
<p></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For experienced users to fine-tune the Helper Applications preferences:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Navigator category, click Helper Applications. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>Perform any of the following procedures: 
    
<p><a name="new_app"></a>To add a new helper application to the list: </p>
<ol>
      
<li>Click New Type. You see the New type dialog box.</li>
<li>Type a description of the type of files the application works with; 
        for instance, "movies" or "sound files." </li>
<li>Type the file extension (suffix) used by this file type. If this type 
        of file uses more than one extension, type them all, separated by spaces. 
      </li>
<li>Type the MIME type. MIME types consist of two words separated by a slash. 
        For instance, a TIFF image file's MIME type is "image/tiff".<br>
        <b>Note: </b>When you download a file, Mozilla will show you the MIME 
        type on the download dialog box. </li>
<li>Click Choose, then select an application that handles files of this 
        type. </li>
<li>Click OK. </li>
</ol>
<p>To specify how Navigator should handle downloaded files: </p>
<ol>
      
<li>Select a file type from the list and click Edit. </li>
<li>Choose a "Handled By" option to have downloaded files saved on your 
        hard disk or opened in an application that you specify. Click Choose to 
        specify the application. </li>
<li>Select "Ask me before opening downloaded files of this type" if you 
        want to be notified before downloading files that are handled by applications 
        other than Navigator. </li>
<li>Click OK. </li>
</ol>
<p>To remove an item from the list: </p>
<ol>
      
<li>Select a file type from the list and click Remove. </li>
<li>Click OK. </li>

<h2>Automatic Loading</h2>
<p><b><font color="#FF0000"><i>[Section needs revision]</i></font></b></p>
<p>When you bring a web page to your screen, Mozilla automatically loads (starts 
  up) several features that help interpret web pages. These features can make 
  web pages more lively, but they take time to load.</p>
<p>To turn off automatic loading:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Click the Advanced category. 
  
<li>To load pages faster, deselect one or all: 
    
<ul>
      
<li><b>Enable Java</b>: Allows Java applets (small programs that add functionality 
        to pages) to run automatically. 
      
<li><b>Enable JavaScript for Navigator</b>: Allows JavaScript (commands 
        that add functionality to pages) to run automatically. 
      
<li><b>Enable JavaScript for Mail &amp; Newsgroups</b>: Allows JavaScript to run 
        automatically for Mail &amp; Newsgroups. 
    
</ul>
</ol>
<p>To save time typing your password when you use "anonymous" as your user ID 
  for an FTP site, choose "Send this email address as anonymous FTP password." Choosing 
  this option transmits your email address automatically when you log on to a 
  public FTP (File Transfer Protocol) site. FTP sites are used for transferring 
  files.</p>

<a name="cache:changing_settingsIDX"></a><a NAME="nav_cache"></a> 
<h2>Changing Cache Settings</h2>
<p>Your computer stores copies of frequently accessed pages in the memory cache 
  or disk cache. This way, the computer doesn't have to retrieve the page from 
  the network each time you view it.</p>
<p>To set the size of the memory cache or to clear it (Windows and Unix only):</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and click Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Advanced category, click Cache. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>Enter a number in the Memory Cache field to specify the size of the memory 
    cache. 1024K to 2000K is a good size. To clear the memory cache immediately, 
    click Clear Memory Cache. 
</ol>
<p><B>Important:</B> A larger memory cache allows more data to be quickly retrieved. 
  But unless you have a lot of extra memory on your computer, 1024K is sufficient.</p>
<p>To set the size of the disk cache or to clear it:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Advanced category, click Cache. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>Enter a number in the Disk Cache field to specify the size of the disk cache. 
    8000K on Windows is sufficient (5000K on Unix). To clear the disk cache immediately, 
    click Clear Disk Cache. 
</ol>
<p><B>Important:</B> A larger disk cache allows more pages to be quickly retrieved, 
  but more of your hard disk space is used.</p>
<p>When you quit Mozilla, it performs cache maintenance. If maintenance takes 
  longer than you wish, try reducing the size of the disk cache.</p>
<p>To specify how often Navigator checks the network for page revisions (so that 
  you don't keep "stale" pages in the cache too long):</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Advanced category, click Cache. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>Choose from the following options:
</ol>
<ul>
<li><b>Every time I view the page</b>: Select this if you want Mozilla 
        to compare a web page to the cache every time you view it.</li>
<li><b>Automatically</b>: Select this if you want Mozilla to compare a 
        web page to the cache when the page is determined by the server to have expired.</li>
<li><b>Once per session</b>: Select this if you want Mozilla to compare 
        a web page to the cache once for each time you start Mozilla.</li>
<li><b>Never</b>: Select this if you do not want Mozilla to compare cached 
        information to the network.</li>
</ul>
<p>If pages that should be in the cache are taking longer to appear than they 
  should, make sure the preference is not set to "Every time I view the page," 
  because the verification requires a network connection that takes time.</p>
<p>To refresh a page at any time:</p>
<ul>
  
<li>Click the Reload button in the browser's navigation toolbar. The computer

<h2>Using Quick Launch</h2>
<p><b>Note:</b>  Quick Launch is available only on Windows  installations 
  of Mozilla.</p>
<p>Quick Launch shortens the time it takes for Mozilla to start. When Mozilla 
  uses Quick Launch, the Mozilla logo icon is present in the taskbar (near 
  the time). Double-clicking on this icon will quickly start Mozilla (if it isn't 
  started already). </p>
<p><b>Tip: </b>To quickly start components (such as Composer, Mail &amp; Newsgroups, and the Address Book window), right-click the Mozilla logo icon and select the component in the pop-up menu.</p>
<p>When you installed Mozilla, you were given the option of enabling or disabling Quick Launch. If your computer is low in memory, or if you are have more then one profile, you can temporarily or permanently disable 
  Quick Launch to conserve memory. If enabled, Quick Launch will start when the user starts Windows.</p>
<p></p>
<p>To temporarily disable Quick Launch until you start Mozilla again:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Close all open Mozilla windows, including Navigator, Mail &amp; Newsgroups, and Composer. 
    If you have unsaved information, you are asked if you want to save it.</li>
<li>Right-click on the Mozilla logo icon in the taskbar (near the time) and select &quot;Exit Mozilla&quot; from the pop-up menu.</li>
</ol>
<p> </p>
<p>To enable or disable Quick Launch in Mozilla:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Click the Advanced category. 
  
<li>Select &quot;Quick Launch&quot; to enable Quick Launch, or deselect 
    it to disable Quick Launch. 
  
<li>Click OK. 
    
<p><b>Tip: </b>To easily disable Quick Launch,   right-click on the Mozilla logo in the taskbar (near the time) and select &quot;Disable Quick Launch&quot; in the pop-up menu.</p>

<p>This section explains how to work with proxies. 
<p><a NAME="nav_prox"></a> </p>
<h2>Setting Proxy Values</h2>
<p>Many organizations block access from the Internet to their networks. This prevents 
  outside parties from gaining access to sensitive information. The protection 
  is called a firewall.</p>
<p>If your organization has a firewall, the browser may need to go through a proxy 
  server before connecting you to the Internet. The proxy server prevents outsiders 
  from breaking into your organization's private network.</p>
<p>Before you start:</p>
<ul>
  
<li>If there's a proxy configuration file at your workplace, ask the system 
    administrator for its URL. 
  
<li>If there's no proxy configuration file, ask your system administrator for 
    the names and port numbers of the servers running proxy software for each 
    network service. 
</ul>
<p>To set the browser to work with the proxy:</p>
<ol>
  
<li>Open the Edit menu and choose Preferences. 
  
<li>Under the Advanced category, click Proxies. (If no subcategories are visible, double-click the category to expand the list.) 
  
<li>Select one of the following: 
    
<ul>
      
<li><b>Direct connection to the Internet:</b> Choose this if you don't have 
        to go through a proxy. 
      
<li><b>Manual proxy configuration:</b> Choose this if you don't have a proxy 
        configuration file. Type the name or numeric IP address of the proxy server 
        for HTTP and FTP. Type each proxy server's port number in the Port field.</li>
<li><b>Automatic proxy configuration URL:</b> Choose this if you have a 
        proxy configuration file. Type the file's URL in the field and click Reload. 
    
</ul>
</ol>
<p>(If you select Manual proxy configuration) In the "No Proxy for" field, type 
  the names of any domains that you can connect to directly, bypassing the proxy. 
  For example, if you type "netscape.com", then the proxy is bypassed each time 
  you view a web page from netscape.com.</p>
<p>Domain names are the part of a URL that contains the name of an organization, 
  business, or school&#151;such as netscape.com or washington.org. If you use local 
  host names without the domain name, list them the same way. Use commas to separate 
  multiple host names. The wildcard character [*] cannot be used.</p>
