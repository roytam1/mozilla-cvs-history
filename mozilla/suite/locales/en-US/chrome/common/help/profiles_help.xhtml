<h1 id="managing_profiles">Managing Profiles</h1>

<p>If you use the Internet at home and at work, you may want to have access to
  a different set of bookmarks, preferences, address books, email accounts,
  Sidebar setup, and so on. Similarly, family members may want to share a copy
  of the same browser software but keep their Internet identities separate.</p>

<p>The Profile Manager lets you create different profiles, each with its own
  bookmarks, preferences, email settings, and so on. You automatically create a
  default profile when you first install your browser software. After you
  create one or more additional profiles, you will be asked which you want to
  use each time you launch the browser.</p>

<p>You may want to delete profiles that you don't normally use. To delete or
  rename an existing profile:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open the Profile Manager:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>If &brandShortName; is running:</strong> Open the Tools menu
        and select Switch Profile. <strong>Note:</strong> You can't delete the
        profile that is in use.</li>

  <li>To delete a profile, select its name and click Delete Profile. In the
    confirmation box, choose one of the following options:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Delete files:</strong> Deletes the whole profile folder
        with its stored data (bookmarks, preferences, email
        accounts, and so on). <em>Make sure that you won't need anything from
        the profile in the future before you choose this option.</em></li>
      <li><strong>Don't delete files:</strong> Removes the profile from the
        list of available profiles, but keeps the profile folder. By choosing
        this option none of your profile's stored data will be deleted.</li>
    </ul>
    To rename a profile, select its name, click Rename Profile, and follow the
    instructions.</li>
