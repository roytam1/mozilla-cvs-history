Mac OS X Installation Instructions
----------------------------------

   To install SeaMonkey by downloading the SeaMonkey disk image,
   follow these steps:

   1. Click the link to seamonkey-x.xx.en-US.mac.dmg (or similar file
      name) to download it to your machine. By default, the file
      is downloaded to your desktop.

   2. Once you have downloaded the .dmg file, if the disk image doesn't
      mount automatically, double-click on the .dmg file to mount it. If
      that fails, and the file does not look like a disk image file, do a
      "Show Info" on the file, and, in the "Open with application"
      category, choose Disk Copy. You can also use "Open with" from the
      context menu.

   3. Once the disk image mounts, open it, and drag the SeaMonkey icon
      onto your hard disk.

   4. We recommend that you copy it to the Applications folder.

   5. Now Eject the disk image.

   6. If you like, you can drag SeaMonkey to your dock to have it easily
      accessible at all times. You might also wish to select SeaMonkey as
      your default browser in the Internet system preferences pane (under
      the Web tab).
