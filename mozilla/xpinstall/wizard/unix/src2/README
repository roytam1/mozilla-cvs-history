Mozilla is subject to the terms detailed in the license
agreement accompanying it.

This Read Me file contains information about system
requirements and installation instructions for the Windows,
Mac OS, and Linux builds of Mozilla. 

For more info on Mozilla, see www.mozilla.org. To submit bugs
or other feedback, see the Navigator QA menu and check out
Bugzilla at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org for links to known
bugs, bug-writing guidelines, and more. You can also get help
with Bugzilla by pointing your IRC client to #mozillazine
at irc.mozilla.org.

                      Getting Mozilla

==============================================================

You can download nightly builds of Mozilla from the
Mozilla.org FTP site at

  ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/

For the very latest builds, see

  ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest

Keep in mind that nightly builds, which are used by
Mozilla.org developers for testing, may be buggy. If you are
looking for a more polished version of Mozilla, Mozilla.org
releases Milestone builds of Mozilla every six weeks or so
that you can download from

  http://www.mozilla.org/releases
 
Be sure to read the Mozilla release notes for information
on known problems and installation issues with Mozilla.
The release notes can be found at the preceding URL along
with the milestone releases themselves.

Note: Please use Talkback builds whenever possible. These
builds allow transmission of crash data back to Mozilla
developers, improved crash analysis, and posting of crash
information to our crash-data newsgroup.

                 Installation Instructions

==============================================================

For Mac OS and Windows users, it is strongly recommended that
you exit all programs before running the setup program. Also,
you should temporarily disable virus-detection software.

For Linux users, note that the installation instructions use
the bash shell. If you're not using bash, adjust the commands
accordingly.

For all platforms, install into a clean (new) directory.
Installing on top of previously released builds may cause
problems.

Note: These instructions do not tell you how to build Mozilla.
For info on building the Mozilla source, see

  http://www.mozilla.org/source.html


Windows Installation Instructions
---------------------------------

Note: For Windows NT/2000/XP systems, you need Administrator
privileges to install Mozilla. If you see an "Error 5" message
during installation, make sure you're running the installation
with Administrator privileges.


    To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer,
    follow these steps:
	
	1. Click the the mozilla-win32-installer.exe link on
	the site you're downloading Mozilla from to download
	the installer file to your machine.
	
	2. Navigate to where you downloaded the file and
	double-click the Mozilla program icon on your machine
	to begin the Setup program.
	
	3. Follow the on-screen instructions in the setup
	program. The program starts automatically the first
	time.


    To install Mozilla by downloading the .zip file and
    installing manually, follow these steps:

	1. Click the mozilla-win32-talkback.zip link or the
	mozilla-win32.zip link on the site you're down-
	loading Mozilla from to download the .zip file to
	your machine.

	2. Navigate to where you downloaded the file and
	double-click the compressed file.

	Note: This step assumes you already have a recent
	version of WinZip installed, and that you know how to
	use it. If not,	you can get WinZip and information
	about the program at www.winzip.com.

	3. Extract the .zip file to a directory such as
	C:\Program Files\mozilla.org\Mozilla.

	4. To start Mozilla, navigate to the directory you
	extracted Mozilla to and double-click the Mozilla.exe
	icon.

	
Mac OS Installation Instructions
--------------------------------

Note: If the downloaded file does not expand automatically
you must expand the file using a program such as StuffIt
Expander. Expander ships with all new Macs and comes with the
default system install, so you may want to do a find in
Sherlock for "StuffIt" to make sure that you don't already
have it installed.

If you don't have Expander, you can get a copy at the
following Web site:

  http://www.aladdinsys.com/expander/expander_mac_login.html

If you do already have Expander, you need to set it to start
by default. See the above URL for info on using Expander.


    To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer,
    (recommended) follow these steps:

	1. Click the MacMozillaInstaller.sea.bin link on the
	site you're downloading Mozilla from to	download the
	file to your Mac's desktop. A MozillaInstaller
	folder is created.
	
	2. Double-click the MozillaInstaller folder in the
	Finder.

	3. Double-click the Mozilla Installer icon.

	4. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the
	installation process.

	5. To start Mozilla, open the folder where you
	installed Mozilla and double-click the Mozilla icon.


    To install Mozilla by downloading the .bin file and
    installing manually, follow these steps:

	1. Click the mozilla-mac-*.sea.bin link on the site
	you're downloading Mozilla from to download the
	Mozilla binary to your Mac's desktop.

	2. Double-click the mozilla-mac-*.sea.sit.bin icon
	on your desktop.

	3. Choose the directory where you want to install
	Mozilla.

	4. To start Mozilla, open the folder where you
	installed Mozilla and double-click the Mozilla icon.


Linux Installation Instructions
-------------------------------

Note: If you install in the default directory (which is
usually /usr/local/mozilla), or any other directory where
only the root user normally has write-access, you must
start Mozilla first as root before other users can start
the program. Doing so generates a set of files required
for later use by other users.


    To install Mozilla by downloading the Mozilla installer,
    follow these steps:

	1. Create a directory named mozilla (mkdir mozilla)
	and change to that directory (cd mozilla).
	
	2. Click the link on the site you're downloading
	Mozilla from to download the installer file
	(called mozilla-1686-pc-linux-gnu-installer.tar.gz)
	to your machine.

	3. Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla) and
	decompress the archive with the following command:

	  tar zxvf moz*.tar.gz

	The installer is now located in a subdirectory of
	Mozilla	named mozilla-installer.

	4. Change to the mozilla-installer directory
	(cd mozilla-installer) and run the installer with the
	./mozilla-installer command.

 	5. Follow the instructions in the install wizard for
	installing Mozilla.

	Note: If you have a slower machine, be aware that the
	installation may take some time. In this case, the
	installation progress may appear to hang indefinitely,
	even though the installation is still in process.

	6. To start Mozilla, change to the directory where you
	installed it and run the ./mozilla command.


    To install Mozilla by downloading the tar.gz file:

	1. Create a directory named "mozilla" (mkdir mozilla)
	and change to that directory (cd mozilla).

	2. Click the link on the site you're downloading
	Mozilla from to download the non-installer
	(mozilla*.tar.gz) file into the mozilla directory.

	3. Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla) and
	decompress the file with the following command:

	  tar zxvf moz*.tar.gz
 	
	This creates a "mozilla" directory under your mozilla
	directory. 

	4. Change to the mozilla directory (cd mozilla). 

	5. Run Mozilla with the following run script: 

	  ./mozilla


    To hook up Mozilla complete with icon to the GNOME Panel,
    follow these steps:

	1. Click the GNOME Main Menu button, open the Panel menu,
	and then open the Add to Panel submenu and choose Launcher.

	2. Right-click the icon for Mozilla on the Panel and
	enter the following command:
	  directory_name./mozilla

	where directory_name is the name of the directory
	you downloaded mozilla to. For example, the default
	directory that Mozilla suggests is /usr/local/mozilla.

	3. Type in a name for the icon, and type in a comment
	if you wish.

	4. Click the icon button and type in the following as
	the icon's location:

	  directory_name/icons/mozicon50.xpm

	where directory name is the directory where you
	installed Mozilla. For example, the default directory
	is /usr/local/mozilla/icons/mozicon50.xpm.
