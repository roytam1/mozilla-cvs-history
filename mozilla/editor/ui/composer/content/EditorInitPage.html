<h2>Ender Editor Test Page</h2>

<p>This is a good place to add in html to aid in testing features 
under development.  It's also a great place to not use latin.

Here is some very run-o-the-mill text in a paragraph tag, for those
of you who are into that kind of thing. I think at this point I shall
regale you with some of my inestimable poetry, which will be presented
in blockquote mode for your reading pleasure.  This particular sample
was written when I was eleven years old, but is remarkably similar to 
the writings of my later "hard-livin" years.  It's titled "Reruns":
</p>

<blockquote>
<h4>Reruns</h4>
Reruns are about as much fun,<br>
as your dad taking all your mun,<br>
and giving it to a nun,<br>
as a contribution.
</blockquote>

There are 4 br tags on either side of this sentence.

One more paragraph for the road.  A true Klingon fears not the atrocious
editing file format hoisted on us by html.  Well, maybe he does, a little.
But he hides it well.
