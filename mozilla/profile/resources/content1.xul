<b>Communicator Profile Manager</b>
<p>
Creating a New Profile
<br></br>
Communicator stores information about your settings, preferences, bookmarks and 
<br></br>
stored messages in your personal profile.
</p>

<p>
If you are sharing this copy of Communicator with other users, you can use profiles 
<br></br>
to keep each user's information separate. To do this, each user should create his or 
<br></br>
her own profile and optionally protect it with a password.
</p>

<p>
If you are the only person using this copy of Communicator, you must create atleast
<br></br>
one profile. If you would like, you can create multiple profiles for yourself to store 
<br></br>
different sets of setting and preferences. For example, you may want to have separate 
<br></br>
profiles for business and personal use.
</p>
