        * Merge Mozilla mstone HEAD with Sendmail,Inc. modifications. In
          particular, this included some hand-waving around the bitwise
          operators "leaveMailOnServer" in the Mozilla branch and the
          dinst_t struct pish->leaveMailOnServerDist.

        * Fix comments, properly attribute Sean O'Rourke's contributions.

2004-09-21  Thom O'Connor <thom@sendmail.com>

	* Modified config/config.mk to build SSL version of mailclient.

	* Remove _thread_sys_poll defininition for poll in FreeBSD builds
	(bench.h).

	* distributions can now be truncated.  This is used to prevent
	0-recipient messages, and could be used to prevent enormous
	messages.

	* throttling: Preload workloads use some additional mstone magic
	to throttle delivery rate based on server responsiveness.  This is
	still in the experimental phase, and may change.

	* fix for parsing bug exposed by distribution truncation notation.

	* clients: Fixed up code for specifying client counts on a
	per-host or per-group basis.  This eliminates the need to force
	the mozilla distribution code to do one's bidding.

	* smtpsink.pl: Very basic threaded perl SMTP sink.  This may go
	away to be replaced by the sink from smtpslam.  Needs much better
	statistics.

	* checksums added.  See {checksum,md5}.{c,h}.  Auto-generated
	messages can currently have checksums computed over the body, and
	pop and multipop retrieval will verify the sum.

	* MIME generation changed to generate deep messages rather than
	  several parts.  This should be a better test of MIME parsers,
	  forcing them to save more state.

2001-02-18    Sean O'Rourke <sean@sendmail.com>

	* mstone_changes.html: update SSL documentation.

	* wld, defaults.pm: divide the ever-expanding "config" section
	  into more descriptive subparts: clients, server, sink, mstone.

	* report: now in bin directory, where it should be.

2001-02-17    Sean O'Rourke <sean@sendmail.com>

	* client.c, main.c, parse.c: removed old throttling code, as it
	  wasn't being used.
	
	* ALL: General code cleanup.
	
	* sysdep.c: simplified rlimit-bumping code, added increase for
	  RLIM_NPROC, as threads are procs on some systems.

	* imap4.c: removed silliness of malloc()ing a buffer the size of
	  the entire message every time we retrieve a message.

	* xalloc.c, xalloc.h: consolidated memory allocation so everyone
	  handles OOM the same way (for now, dump core).

	* constants.h: various assumptions and limits, were in bench.h.

	* events: added event-queue model to reduce thread requirements.
	  Eventually, it would be nice for a consultant to be able to run
	  this off a laptop to test a small- to medium-sized box.  For
	  now, at least, configuration remains the same.  This doesn't
	  work on NT.  Oh, well.
