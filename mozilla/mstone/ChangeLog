Mstone - version 4.x

	* Merged setup and mstone into one script to reduce command
	namespace polution.  "mstone setup" is the the same as "setup".

	* Made setup try to be more tolerant of OSes that were not
	include in the distribution.  SunOS 5.7 will fall back to 5.6.

	* Now package conf/general.wld.in and only copy to general.wld if
	there isn't one already in place.  This means that you can unpack
	new bits over old bits without blowing away your configuration.
	
	* Added <includeOnce file> command to workloads.  This allows
	tests to be used either as a stand alone or as part of another
	test (e.g. smtp).

	* Converted ChangeLog to more common formating

	* Spilt off old ChangeLog entries to ChangeLog.1 and ChangeLog.2
