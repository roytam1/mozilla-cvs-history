Mstone building instructions

For Unix, just "gmake" one of these
	release		The usual optimized build
	debug		Debug build includes some asserts

	rpackage	Build the release and package it
	dpackage	Build the debug version and package it

	unix_OPT	Build a UNIX multi-platform package
	unix_DBG	Build a UNIX multi-platform debug package

You can build multiple OSes in the same tree.  Debug and optimized
builds are kept separately.  The unix_??? targets will combine
whatever OSes are present into a multi-architecture package.

For NT, run autobuild.bat.  This will build and package both the debug
and optimized versions.  Perl must already be built and installed in \.


Helper components

Mstone can build and package perl, gnuplot, and gd.  This is currently
being re-worked, but should be fixed soon.
