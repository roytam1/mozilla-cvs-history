Mstone building instructions

For Unix, just "gmake" one of these
	release		The usual optimized build
	debug		Debug build includes some asserts

	rpackage	Build the release and package it
	dpackage	Build the debug version and package it

	unix_OPT	Build a UNIX multi-platform package
	unix_DBG	Build a UNIX multi-platform debug package

You can build multiple OSes in the same tree.  Debug and optimized
builds are kept separately.  The unix_??? targets will combine
whatever OSes are present into a multi-architecture package.

For NT, run autobuild.bat.  This will build and package both the debug
and optimized versions.  Perl must already be built and installed in \.


Helper components

Mstone can build and package perl, gnuplot, and gd.  These will be
automatically built and packaged if they are present.

Unpack gd1.3 or later in the mstone directory.  You can probably find
gd from here: http://www.boutell.com/gd/.  The directory should look
like gd1.3.  Right now we need the (obsolete) version 1.3 to generate
GIF files (without patented run-length coding).  The scripts need to
be updated to be able to handle PNG files, too.

Unpack gnuplot 3.7 or later in the mstone directory.  You can probably
find gnuplot from http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/gnuplot_info.html.  The
directory should look like gnuplot-3.7 (the exact version should not
matter).  Gnuplot requres gd to generate GIFs (which is what we need).

Unpack perl 5.005 or later in the mstone directory.  You can probably
find perl from http://www.perl.com/pub/language/info/software.html.
The directory should look like perl5.005_03 (the exact version should
not matter).
