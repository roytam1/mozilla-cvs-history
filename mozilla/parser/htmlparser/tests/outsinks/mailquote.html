I hope you will enjoy this quote from <em>Hamlet</em>, introduced by a fairly long line to see how quotations get wrapped:
<p>
To be, or not to be, that is the question<br>
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br>
The slings and fortunes of outrageous fortune<br>
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles<br>
And by opposing end them.<br>
