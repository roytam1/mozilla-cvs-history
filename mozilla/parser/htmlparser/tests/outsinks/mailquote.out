> I hope you will enjoy this quote from Hamlet, introduced by a fairly long line to see how quotations get wrapped:
> 
> To be, or not to be, that is the question
> Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
> The slings and fortunes of outrageous fortune
> Or to take arms against a sea of troubles
> And by opposing end them.
