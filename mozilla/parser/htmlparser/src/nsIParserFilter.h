/**
 * MODULE NOTES:
 * @update  jevering 6/17/98
 * 
 * This interface is not yet used; it was intended to allow an observer object
 * to "look at" the i/o stream coming into the parser before, during and after
 * the parser saw it. The intention of this was to allow an observer to modify
 * the stream at various stages.
