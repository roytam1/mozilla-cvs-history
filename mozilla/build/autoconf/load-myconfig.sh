# load-myconfig.sh - Loads options from myconfig.sh onto configure's
#    command-line. The myconfig.sh is searched for in the following
#    order: $MOZ_MYCONFIG, $objdir/myconfig.sh, $topsrcdir/myconfig.sh.
#
#    The options from myconfig.sh are inserted into the command-line
#    before the real command-line options. This way the real options
#    will override any myconfig.sh options.
#
# myconfig.sh is a shell script. To add an option to configure's
#    command-line use the pre-defined function, ac_add_options,
#
#       ac_add_options  <configure-option> [<configure-option> ... ]
#
#    For example,
#
#       ac_add_options --with-pthreads --enable-debug
#
# ac_add_options can be called multiple times in myconfig.sh.
#    Each call adds more options to configure's command-line.
#
# Send comments, improvements, bugs to Steve Lamm (slamm@netscape.com).
