## Usage:
##
## $ mozilla
##
## This script is meant to run a mozilla program from the mozilla
## rpm installation.
##
## The script will setup all the environment voodoo needed to make
## mozilla work.

##
## Standard shell script disclaimer blurb thing:
##
## This script is a hcak.  Its brute force.  Its horrible.  
## It doesnt use Artificial Intelligence.  It doesnt use Virtual Reality.
## Its not perl.  Its not python.  It probably wont work unchanged on
## the "other" thousands of unices.  But it worksforme.
##
## If you have an improvement, patch, idea, whatever, on how to make this
## script better, post it here:
##
## news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.patches
## news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.unix
##
## 

##
## Potential improvements:
##
## + Run ldd on the program and report missing dlls
## + All the "other" unices/packages
