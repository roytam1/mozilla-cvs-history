	About this file
	---------------
	
	This file contains some handy macros, and a stack-based class that makes
	instrumenting functions with Apple's Instrumentation SDK easier.
	
	Instrumentation SDK
	-------------------
	
	The Instrumentation SDK allows you to do code performance analysis,
	collecting time-based data, and other data by putting instrumentation
	points in your code, and running.
	
	You can get the instrumentation SDK from:
	
	ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Development_Kits/Instrumentation_SDK.hqx
	
	To find out how to use the Instrumentation Toolkit, read the documentation
	that comes with the SDK. I'm not going to explain all that here.
	
	Setting up your tree
	--------------------
	
	After a clean build, make aliases to the following files from the SDK
	somewhere in dist (I usually throw them into dist:mac):
	
	Instrumentation.h
	InstrumentationMacros.h
	InstrumentationLib
	
	Make an alias to this file in the same place in dist:
	
	InstrumentationHelpers.h	
	
	How to use
	----------
	
	In C++ code, the following macros can be used thusly:
	
	NS_IMETHODIMP nsBigThing::SlowFunction()
	{
	  INST_TRACE("SomeLocationDescription");			// Descriptive label. Don't use :: here.
	
	  // code that might return anywhere.
	  ...
	
	  return NS_OK;
	}
	
  Because the INST_TRACE macro makes a stack-based StInstrumentationLog,
  exit from the function will be traced wherever it occurs.
  
  You will also need to add the "InstrumentationLib" stub library to the
  project.
  
  Such instrumentation points will give you data for the
  'Trace Time Line Viewer' in the viewer. There are many other types
  of instrumentation data you can collect; see the docs in the SDK
  for more information.
  
  Stalking the wild time sink
  ---------------------------
  
  Your general strategy when using the Instrumentation tools to
  track down performance problems should be to start at the high
  level, then drill down into subroutines. You want to avoid 
  instrumenting routines that are called hundreds of thousands
  of times, because you'll end up with massive data files. Rather,
  instrument their calling routines to get a good sense of where
  the time goes.
  
  This kind of performance analysis does not replace the more
  traditional profiling tools. Rather, it allows you to analyse
  performance problems in terms of behaviour and timing, rather
  than a simply overview of % of time spent in different routines.
