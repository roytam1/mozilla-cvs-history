$BUILD_ROOT				= ":";
								# $BUILD_ROOT = ":", the default, with $build{all}
								# builds the whole tree. Leaving $BUILD_ROOT undefined
								# will also have this effect.
								#
								# $BUILD_ROOT = ":mozilla:mailnews:" with $build{all}
								# will "make everything in the mailnews directory".
								#
								# This is equivalent to the unix commands:
								#   cd mozilla/mailnews
								#   gmake
								# or the windows commands:
								#   cd mozilla\mailnews
								#   nmake -f makefile.win
								#
								# In conjunction with build{all}, this will carry out
								# all build phases (export, build, install...), but only
								# using files inside $BUILD_ROOT. Replace $build{all}
								# with specific component flags to build stuff from
								# those components that happens to live inside
								# $BUILD_ROOT.
								#
								# ":", and ":mozilla:" both have the same effect, because
								# this works by checking that path strings begin with
								# $BUILD_ROOT.
								#
								# $BUILD_ROOT affects only the build phase, not the pull
								# phase. There is still no scriptable way to update-and-build
								# a specific directory. In particular, $pull{all} will
								# still pull the whole tree, irrespective of the
								# setting of $BUILD_ROOT. To update and build a particular
								# directory, use MacCVS Pro to update the directory,
								# then turn off all $pull variables, and set $BUILD_ROOT.
