/**
 * <B>INTERFACE TO NETSCAPE COMMUNICATOR PLUGINS (NEW C++ API).</B>
 *
 * <P>This supersedes the old plugin API (npapi.h, npupp.h), and 
 * eliminates the need for glue files: npunix.c, npwin.cpp and npmac.cpp that
 * get linked with the plugin. You will however need to link with the "backward
 * adapter" (badapter.cpp) in order to allow your plugin to run in pre-5.0
 * browsers. 
 *
 * <P>See nsPlugin.idl for an overview of how this interface fits with the 
 * overall plugin architecture.
