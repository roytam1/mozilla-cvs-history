 * <P>This superscedes the old plugin API (npapi.h, npupp.h), and 
 * eliminates the need for glue files: npunix.c, npwin.cpp and npmac.cpp that
 * get linked with the plugin. You will however need to link with the "backward
 * adapter" (badapter.cpp) in order to allow your plugin to run in pre-5.0
 * browsers.

// Plugin Instance Interface

/**
 * The nsIPluginInstance interface is the minimum interface plugin developers
 * need to support in order to implement a plugin instance. The plugin manager
 * may QueryInterface for more specific types, e.g. nsILiveConnectPluginInstance. 
 *
 * (Corresponds to NPP object.)
 *
 * The old NPP_Destroy call has been factored into two plugin instance 
 * methods:
 *
 * Stop -- called when the plugin instance is to be stopped (e.g. by 
 * displaying another plugin manager window, causing the page containing 
 * the plugin to become removed from the display).
 *
 * Destroy -- called once, before the plugin instance peer is to be 
 * destroyed. This method is used to destroy the plugin instance.
