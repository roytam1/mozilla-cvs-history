/**
 * the IPC service provides the means to communicate with an external IPC
 * daemon and/or other mozilla-based applications on the same physical system.
 * the IPC daemon hosts modules (some builtin and others dynamically loaded)
 * with which applications may interact.
 *
 * at application startup, the IPC service will attempt to establish a
 * connection with the IPC daemon.  the IPC daemon will be automatically
 * started if necessary.  when a connection has been established, the IPC
 * service will enumerate the "ipc-startup-category" and broadcast an
 * "ipc-startup" notification using the observer service.
 *
 * when the connection to the IPC daemon is closed, an "ipc-shutdown"
 * notification will be broadcast.
 *
 * each client has a name.  the client name need not be unique across all
 * clients, but it is usually good if it is.  the IPC service does not require
 * unique names.  instead, the IPC daemon assigns each client a unique ID that
 * is good for the current "session."  clients can query other clients by name
 * or by ID.  the IPC service supports forwarding messages from one client to
 * another via the IPC daemon.
 *
 * for performance reasons, this system should not be used to transfer large
 * amounts of data.  instead, applications may choose to utilize shared memory,
 * and rely on the IPC service for synchronization and small message transfer
 * only.
