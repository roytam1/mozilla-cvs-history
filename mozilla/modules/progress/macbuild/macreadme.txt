In order for this module to work, PW_Resources.cnst must be the part of the main binary,
otherwise, we'll be unable to find the resources.

The correct way to find the resources would be to store our RF number in the binary, but
I did not figure out how to do this painlessly (without figuring our RF number inside 
__initialize).
