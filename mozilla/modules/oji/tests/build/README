============================
I. To build OJI API test:
============================

 1. set MOZILLA_HOME (top of Mozilla's tree) and JAVAHOME variables
 2. goto build directory and say
	nmake -f Makefile.win

===========================
II. To run OJI API tests:
===========================

 1. Add the following string into your <yourProfile>/prefs.js file
 	user_pref("security.checkxpconnect", false);	
 2. Update Path variable to include 
	$MOZILLA_HOME/dist/win32_d.obj/bin and
	$MOZILLA_HOME/dist/win32_d.obj/bin/components
 3. Delete component.reg file in Mozilla's bin directory
 4. Copy test.html to a location on your WebServer.
 5. Set environment variable TEST_URL to point to URL path where 
    test.html is located (http://<DOCROOT>/).
 6. Goto script directory and set correct parameters in the first few 
    lines of autorun.pl file.
	$ADDITIONAL_PARAMETERS : Specify Profile name if other than default 
                                 (-P mozProfile).

        $DELAY_FACTOR          : time in seconds after which the mozilla has 
                                 to be killed. It takes more time to load on 
                                 slower machine hence more time to execute the 
                                 test. By default it is set to 30secs.
 7. Add classes/test.jar to your CLASSPATH.
 8. Alter your Java Policy File, and add this entry.
       grant {
         permission java.security.AllPermission;
       };
    (this is required so that native libraries can be loaded. Only used if 
     running JNIEnv Tests).
 
 9. Run perl script
	perl autorun.pl
 10. See results of execution in the log directory.
