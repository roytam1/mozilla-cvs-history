   *  On entry, the native color space and the original dimensions of the
   *  source image and its mask are initially filled in the two provided
   *  IL_Pixmap arguments.  (If no mask or alpha channel is present, the
   *  second pixmap is NULL.)
   * 
   *  The width and height arguments represent the desired dimensions of the
   *  target image.  If the implementation supports scaling, then the
   *  storage allocated for the IL_Pixmaps may be based on the original
   *  dimensions of the source image.  In this case, the headers of the
   *  IL_Pixmap should not be modified, however, the implementation
   *  should be able to determine the target dimensions of the image for
   *  a given IL_Pixmap.  (The opaque client_data pointer in the IL_Pixmap
   *  structure can be used to store the target image dimensions or a scale
   *  factor.)
   * 
   *  If the implementation does not support scaling, the supplied width
   *  and height must be used as the dimensions of the created pixmap storage
   *  and the headers within the IL_Pixmap should be side-effected to reflect
   *  that change.
   * 
   *  The allocator may side-effect the image and mask headers to target
   *  a different colorspace.
   * 
   *  The allocation function should side-effect bits, a member of the
   *  IL_Pixmap structure, to point to allocated storage.  If there are
   *  insufficient resources to allocate both the image and mask, neither
   *  should be allocated. (The bits pointers, initially NULL-valued,
   *  should not be altered.)
