Imglib Decoders as Components:

Basic description:

I have 4 new subdirectories to make below mozilla/modules/libimg.
Some of the files in mozilla/modules/libimg/src and libimg/public
have been moved to one of the new directories or 'retired'. 

I have new exports in libimg/public and libimg/public_com. 
I have a few new files that should go into the new directories.

------------------------------
The old structure:

libimg/
	/src
	/public
	/png

The new structure:
