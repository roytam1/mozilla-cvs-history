libmng v0.5.1
-------------

This is the second developers-release!

The library is still very much in development, and changes by the day.
This version lacks a little less than a zillion things so it's getting
there. But as it is still quite stable and can display 95% of the
test-files on my system, I thought it a good time to gather some input,
and perhaps start on some parallelism in the development cycle.

What I'm still looking for, are people willing to see if they can
compile this on their platform and (very) perhaps link it into an
existing app?!?

So far I've only done tests on Windoze, so there's a lot of tweaking
to be done for other platforms. Hopefully only makefile and "types.h".

Tips of general nature are welcome too.

Please note that all changes need to pass through me to get into
this version. If you decide to take this source and veer off into
a different direction, than good luck. Don't expect support!

At this stage it's hard to say how fast or slow things will be going,
so keep in touch. Latest news will be on the discussion-list for MNG,
and through my news-letter. And naturally on the web-site:

You can now also find interesting stuff on SourceForge.net:

Enjoy!
