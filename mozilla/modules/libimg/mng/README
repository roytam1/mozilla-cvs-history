libmng v0.9.3
-------------

This is the fourth beta-release!

Quite a few changes, since there has been several changes in the MNG spec.
Also fixes a number of problems that have surfaced during extensive tests.
And a number of functions have been added to facilitate in integrating
the library in a multitude of applications, as these were the result of
requests from several implementors.

This is another release candidate. If no significant problems are discovered,
libmng 1.0.0 will be just around the corner!
