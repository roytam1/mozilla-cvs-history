mozilla/xpfe/bootstrap/init.d/README

This file describes the mechanism for installing and executing
initialization and termination scripts used to implement pluggable
shell scripts to modify the behaviour of Mozilla/FireFox/ThunderBird/SunBird.

File names in the mozilla/init.d/ and %user_profile%/init.d/
(for example ${HOME}/.mozilla/init.d/ for Mozilla) are of the form
[SK]nn<filename> where 'S' means "run this script at application startup",
'K' means "run this script at application termination", and 'nn' is the
sequence number for killing or starting the job.
When the application (e.g. Mozilla) starts scripts prefixed with 'S' are
executed (first those in Mozilla's installation directory, then those in
user's profile directory), on termination those scripts prefixed with 'K'
are being executed (first those in user's profile dir, finally those in
mozilla's installation directory).

When executing each script a single argument is passed to it - argument
'stop' for scripts prefixed with 'K' and the argument 'start' for scripts
prefixed with 'S'.

An exception of this rule are scripts with the suffix *.sh - they are called
"inline" in the current shell process which starts/terminates Mozilla. These
scripts have FULL ACCESS to all variables of the calling script (which means
these scripts can set/modify/unset environment variables used by Mozilla).
Since these scripts run in the same shell the author of such scripts should
ensure that no namespace collisions occur (e.g. accidential modify variable
names used by the parent script).

Any files which do not match the [SK][0-9][0-9]* pattern are FORBIDDEN
in ${HOME}/.mozilla/init.d/ and %user_profile%/init.d/. The only
exception is this README file.
