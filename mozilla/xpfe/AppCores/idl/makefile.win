# This makefile isn't intended to be run as a normal part of the build
# (and isn't, at time of checkin!): it's a convenience for development work.
# If the IDL compiler has been built (also not a normal part of the build),
# then running this makefile will generate the h and cpp stubs from idl
# in this directory, using the DOM IDL compiler.  In practice, since
# the stubs are pregenerated and checked in, you will want to delete
# every file from IDLSRCS except the one you're working on, and then
# run this makefile during development, only.
