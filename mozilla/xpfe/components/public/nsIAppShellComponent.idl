/*--------------------------- nsIAppShellComponent -----------------------------
| This interface describes the fundamental communications between the          |
| application shell and its dynamically installable "components."  Components  |
| are self-contained bits of browser client application functionality.  They   |
| range in size from the general-purpose "Find dialog" up to the "browser."    |
|                                                                              |
| The interface has three main purposes:                                       |
|   o It provides a means for the app shell to identify and load components    |
|     dynamically.                                                             |
|   o It enables those components to contribute to the browser client          |
|     application User Interface (e.g., by adding menu options, etc.).         |
|   o It gives the app shell (and other components) a way to broadcast         |
|     interesting events to other components.                                  |
|                                                                              |
| [Currently, only the first purpose is exploited.]                            |
|                                                                              |
| All app shell components must:                                               |
|   1. Implement this interface.                                               |
|   2. Publish and implement additional interfaces, as necessary, to           |
|      support component-specific function.  For example, the "find            |
|      component" also implements the nsIFindComponent interface which         |
|      adds functions specific to that component.                              |
|   3. Register (using the Mozilla XPCOM component registration facilities)    |
|      using a ProgID of the form:                                             |
|       component://netscape/appshell/component/foo                            |
|      where "foo" is a component-specific identifier (which should match the  |
|      component-specific interface name).                                     |
|                                                                              |
| The app shell will instantiate each such component at application start-up   |
| and invoke the components Initialize() member function, passing a pointer    |
| to the app shell and to the command-line service corresponding to the        |
| command-line arguments used to start the app shell.                          |
|                                                                              |
| The component should implement this function as necessary.  Typically, a     |
| component will register interest in an appropriate set of events (e.g.,      |
| browser windows opening).  Some components, such as the browser, will        |
| examine the command line argements and open windows.                         |
|                                                                              |
| Upon return, the app shell will maintain a reference to the component and    |
| notify it when events of interest occur.                                     |
