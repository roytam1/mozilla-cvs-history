/*----------------------- nsIUnknownContentTypeHandler -------------------------
| This file describes the interface for Mozilla's "unknown content-type        |
| handler" component.  This component is notified whenever the browser         |
| encounters data of some unknown content (mime) type.                         |
|                                                                              |
| This component provides one component-specific member function:              |
| HandleUnknownContentType.  This method's areguments include:                 |
|   o the nsIChannel that encountered the content                              |
|   o the content-type                                                         |
|   o the window that encountered the unknown content.                         |
|                                                                              |
| The expected response by implementors of this interface is to display a      |
| dialog prompting the user for direction on how to handle the content         |
| (e.g., download it, pick an application to use to view it, etc.) and then    |
| carry out that request (perhaps with assistance from other components).      |
