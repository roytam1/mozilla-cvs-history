# LOCALIZATION NOTE (noDefaultPluginTitle): 
#
#    This dialog is displayed when all of the following conditions are
#    met.
#
#    1. The user visits a page with a plugin
#    2. There is no plugin for this content type
#    3. The user has somehow removed the "default plugin" from her 
#       mozilla distribution.  
#
#    The "default plugin" is how we're allowing users to download plugins
#    from Netscape's plugin-finder page.  It will be shipped with NS6,
#    but as many users are in the habit of mucking about with their
#    plugins directory, it's possible they might accidentally remove the
#    default plugin.  This dialog warns them if they do so.
noDefaultPluginTitle=No Plugin Downloader Plugin!
# LOCALIZATION NOTE (noDefaultPluginMessage): 
#
#    This is the message for the noDefaultPlugin dialog.  Please note
#    that the URL must be tweaked.
noDefaultPluginMessage=Netscape cannot find the Plugin Downloader Plugin.  Without the Plugin Downloader Plugin, you cannot automatically download and install plugins.  Please visit http://www.netscape.com/ to install the Plugin Downloader Plugin.
