/*----------------------------- nsIStreamTransfer -----------------------------
| This file describes Mozilla's general-purpose "stream transfer" component.  |
| This component is used to display a progress dialog while performing any of |
| a variety of different "stream transfers."                                  |
|                                                                             |
| Basically, this component transfers data from an input stream to an         |
| output stream while displaying a progress dialog.  The component also       |
| offers some standard implementations of commonly-used input and output      |
| stream handlers (such as prompting for a destination file, writing the      |
| input stream to an output file, loading an input URL, etc.).                |
|                                                                             |
| Select the appropriate transfer function depending on your requirements.    |
|                                                                             |
| Note that all methods are "asynchronous" in that they return before the     |
| stream transfer is completed.  The result generally indicates only whether  |
| or not the stream transfer was successfully initiated.                      |
