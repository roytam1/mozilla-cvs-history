/*----------------------------- nsIStreamTransfer ------------------------------
| This file describes Mozilla's general-purpose "stream transfer" component.   |
| This component is used to display a progress dialog while performing any of  |
| a variety of different "stream transfers."                                   |
|                                                                              |
| Basically, this component transfers data from an input stream to an          |
| output stream while displaying a progress dialog.  The component also        |
| offers some standard implementations of commonly-used input and output       |
| stream handlers (such as prompting for a destination file, writing the       |
| input stream to an output file, loading an input URL, etc.).                 |
|                                                                              |
| Select the appropriate transfer function depending on your requirements.     |
|                                                                              |
| Note that all methods are "asynchronous" in that they return before the      |
| stream transfer is completed.  The result generally indicates only whether   |
| or not the stream transfer was successfully initiated.                       |
