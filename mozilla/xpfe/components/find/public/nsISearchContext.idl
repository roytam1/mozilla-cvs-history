/*----------------------------- nsISearchContext -------------------------------
| This file defines the internal, non-public interface between the default     |
| implementation of the browser's "find component" and it's JavaScript         |
| component (nsFindDialog.js).                                                 |
|                                                                              |
| Please note that you can't rely on use of this interface except with the     |
| default implementation of the find component.                                |
|                                                                              |
| This interface is very simple: it provides 5 attributes that control the     |
| Find and FindNext methods of nsFindComponent.                                |
