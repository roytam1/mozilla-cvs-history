/*----------------------------- nsIFindComponent -------------------------------
| This file describes the interface for Mozilla's pluggable "find" component   |
| that provides the implementation of the browser's "find in document"         |
| function (and perhaps will be generalized to support similar searching in    |
| other contexts).                                                             |
|                                                                              |
| The component itself is a singleton (one per executing application).  To     |
| handle searching on a per-document basis, this interface supplies a          |
| CreateContext() function that creates a search context (generally, on a      |
| per document, and thus per-browser-window, basis).                           |
|                                                                              |
| The component itself will "remember" the last string searched (via any       |
| context).  This way, a search in a new context (browser window) will be      |
| able to search for the same string (by default).                             |
|                                                                              |
| Clients (e.g., the browser window object) will generally use this interface  |
| in this manner:                                                              |
|   1. Hold a reference to the singleton "find component".                     |
|   2. On initial search, ask that component to create a search "context."     |
|   3. Reset the context whenever the underlying web shell changes (but since  |
|      a browser will usually reuse a single web shell, this won't be of       |
|      concern except in obscure cases).                                       |
|   4. Forward "find" and "find next" requests to the component, along         |
|      with the appropriate search context object.                             |
|   5. Release() the search context object and the find component when the     |
|      browser window closes.                                                  |

    | The editor that's passed in is only required for replace. If you pass    |
