/******

  This file contains the list of all XBL nsIAtoms and their values
  
  It is designed to be used as inline input to nsXBLAtoms.cpp *only*
  through the magic of C preprocessing.

  All entires must be enclosed in the macro XBL_ATOM which will have cruel
  and unusual things done to it

  It is recommended (but not strictly necessary) to keep all entries
  in alphabetical order

  The first argument to XBL_ATOM is the C++ identifier of the atom
  The second argument is the string value of the atom
