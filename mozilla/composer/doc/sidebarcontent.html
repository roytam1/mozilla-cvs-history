   <h1>Developing a sidebar for Composer</h1>

   <p>To offer new sidebar content to Composer users, you have to
   distribute your application as an installable extension to
   Composer, a *.xpi file.</p>

   <p>The application id for Composer is
   <code>{8fa6f1b4-7ed3-4895-bac6-01f1cc206ab3}</code> .</p>

   <p>Your extension should add elements to
   chrome://composer/content/composer.xul through a XUL overlay
   :</p>

   <ul>
      <li>append a new <code>sidebaritem</code> element to
      <code>&lt;sidebaritems id="sidebaritems"&gt;</code></li>

      <li>that element must have an ID, unique in the ID name space
      of composer.xul</li>

      <li>that element must have a <code>name</code> attribute,
      representing your sidebar content ; that sidebar should be a
      NAME ; it is recommended that the ID and that attribute have
      the same value</li>

      <li>that element must have a <code>src</code> attribute,
      containing the URL of the document to be shown in your
      sidebar content; this is typically going to be a chrome URL
      in your XPI</li>

      <li>that element can have a&nbsp;<code>title</code>
      containing a (possibly localized) string representing the
      sidebar item. That string will be used in the sidebar to list
      the available sidebar items or title the visible sidebar
      items. If absent, the value of the <code>name</code>
      attribute is used.</li>
   </ul>

   <h1>Make your sidebar observe editor events</h1>
   <p>TBD</p>
