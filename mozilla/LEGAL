Please be apprised of the following Legal Notices:

A) Wang contends that its U.S. Patent No. 4, 751,669 ("the '669
Patent") disclosing a "video text" system, is infringed by the following
functionality in the Netscape Navigator code: 1) the animated logo and
status line indicators --See Claims 1,8 and 9; 2)  the "File Save As"
function --See Claims 23-27; 3) Bookmarks and Rename Bookmarks in the
Properties window --See Claims 20-22; 4) storing HTML, GIF, and JPEG
files and adding filename extensions based on mime types (performed in
Windows OS) --See Claim 38.  Netscape believes the '669 Patent is
invalid and non-infringed. Netscape is vigorously defending against
Wang's claims.

B)   Intermind owns pending U.S. patent applications on communications
systems which employ metadata ("channel objects") to define a control
structure for information transfer.  The Netscape code does not infringe
as released; however, modifications which utilize channel objects as
described by Intermind should be considered carefully. The following is
a statement from Intermind:  "Intermind's claims fundamentally involve
the use of a control structure to automate communications. ...The
essence of Intermind's top claim is that two devices sender and
receiver have persistent storage, communicate over a network,
and exchange a control structure including metadata which describes: 1)
what information is to be updated, 2) when to update this information,
and 3) how to transfer the updated information. In addition, at  least
the receiving device must be able to process the metadata in order to
perform the update determination and transfer. Any digital
communications system which incorporates all of these elements will be
covered by Intermind's patents."  See Intermind.com.

C) Stac, Inc., and its licensing agent Hi/fn, own several patents which
disclose data compression methods implementing an LZS compression
algorithm, including U.S. Patent Nos.  4,701,745 and 5,016, 009 ("the
Stac Patents").  The Netscape Communicator code  does not perform
compression. If you modify the Netscape source code to perform
compression, please take notice of the Stac Patents.
