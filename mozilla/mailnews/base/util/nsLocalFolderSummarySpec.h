// Class to name a summary file for a local mail folder,
// given a full folder file spec. For windows, this just means tacking .msf on the end.
// For Unix, it might mean something like putting a '.' on the front and .msgsummary on the end.
// Note this class expects the invoking code to fully specify the folder path. 
// This class does NOT prepend the local folder directory, or put .sbd on the containing
// directory names.
