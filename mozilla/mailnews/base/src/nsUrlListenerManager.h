/********************************************************************************************
	The url listener manager is a helper class used by all of our subclassed urls to implement
	registration and broadcasting of changes to all of their registered url listeners. I envision
	every url implementation to have a has a relationship with a nsIUrlListenerManager. All
	url listener register/unregister calls are forwarded to the listener manager. In addition,
	the url listener manager handles broadcasting of event changes on the url.

    mscott --> hmm now that I think about it this class is probably going to have to be made
	thread safe. It might have to proxy notification calls into another thread....
