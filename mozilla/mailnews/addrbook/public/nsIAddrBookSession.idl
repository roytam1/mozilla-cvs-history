 * The mail session is a replacement for the old 4.x MSG_Master object. It
 * contains mail session generic information such as the account manager, etc
 * I'm starting this off as an empty interface and as people feel they need to
 * add more information to it, they can. I think this is a better approach
 * than trying to port over the old MSG_Master in its entirety as that had a
 * lot of cruft in it....
