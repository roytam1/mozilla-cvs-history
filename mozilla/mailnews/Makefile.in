# Question: Why do we build base/util and then build base again?
# Answer:
# db needs libmsgbaseutil (base/util)
# base needs db (libmailnewsmsgdb) and news (libnntp)..?
# so db needs base and base needs db.
# 
# Temporary solution:  build base/util, then db, then news, then 
# finish building base
#
# Real solution:
# move base/util out of base
# 
# Question: how come this works on windows?
# From makefile.win:
# DIRS = public base db local news compose mime ui
DIRS = idl public base/util base/public db news base local compose mime ui
