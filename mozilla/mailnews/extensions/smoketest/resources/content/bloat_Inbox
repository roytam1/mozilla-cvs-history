Probably someone spammed, sporged, forged, rogue cancelled or otherwise
molested the group  so that a lot of the messages were removed.

With the M14 build, I noticed that Mozilla on win32 now forks to
another process and no longer keeps the DOS box alive with stdout
streaming to the console.  I've got a lot of debugging info which I'd
like to have available to beta users... Short of distributing debug
builds or using special logging APIs (which require debug builds?) is
there a way for users of the released Mozilla builds to get at the
stdout?  Some sort of runtime switch or environment variable perhaps?

Thanks

I don't think this works anymore, as there's no longer any output to
redirect.  Instead, you see a new fire-breathing dragon window pop up,
and you then get your prompt back in DOS.

  Hi lizards :)
  I want to develop a XUL application that has access to
the main html page of the navigator.
  Let's clarify: I open my mozilla and go to
www.mozilla.org. Then i open my window's application
through the task menu. This application draws an html
element tree of navigator's html page from which the
menu was invoked. For instance the element tree would show
the structure of mozilla.org's index.html .
  Additionally i want to add event handlers. For example
if i click on the lizard's nose, i want the appropiate img
tag to highlight in the tree.
  How can i access the main node of the html page and use
DOM methods on it?
  Thanks!!

  Alexey

Is there a function in NC 4.6 whereby one can easily save WebPages and
even WebSites to any configurable page depth in their entirety to disk
for offline viewing, like "make available offline" and synchronization
in IE5?

Thanks, Allan

Hi Jerry!

If you use cvs to get the sources you could use "cvs diff -c file >
file.diff" to get a usefull diff patch could use.

Otherwise diff -c file1 file2 > file.diff should produce something useable.

I can't seem to find a version of Netscape that
will run on my DEC Alpha workstation (running NT
4.0).  When I run the Communicator setup program
intended for Windows95/98/NT I receiver the
following message: "Setup requires a different
versio of windows.  Check to make sure you are
running setup on the Windows platform for which
it was intended.  Error 102"  Isn't NT for a DEC
Alpha still NT!?

on nt4 running netscape 7.2 and then click on 12 different URLs
opening them all in different windows ... and it adds about 4mbytes to

On all releases of netscape 4.x (and earlier), I can right-click on a
url, get a pop-up window, move to "open in new window" selection and
click (opening the URL in a new window).

On mozilla 15, 16, 17, 18, 0.6, etc and netscape 6.xs, if I right
click on a URL, i get the pop-up window but if i move the mouse at all
the pop-up window immediately disappears (no ability to select "open
in new window").

I am running tweak ui with mouse settings set to "follow"
... i.e. x-mouse mode ... on nt4sp6 ... which may or may not have
anything to do with it.

Greetings all

If you document.close(), document.open(), then document.write() the
*contents* of a frame, and those contents are long enough to warrant a
scroll bar, Netscape 6.01 won't give you one.

If you try to fool it by loading a SPAN or DIV in to the frame that is large
enough to force a scrollbar, then replace the content with document.close(),
document.open(), document.write(), the scrollbar does not work (doesn't even
respond).

Is there a way to make this work?  I can't find anything in Bugzilla.  Do I
need to create a bug?

Test case.  Create three files:

nsft.htm
<HTML>
<FRAMESET FRAMEBORDER="Yes" ROWS="50%,50%">
 <FRAME SRC="blank.htm" SCROLLING="Yes" NAME="SomeFrame"
ID="SomeFrame"></FRAME>

I am very impressed with Mozilla, and I am ready to use it as my default
browser. The only thing stopping me is that I cannot determine how to
emulate my Netscape Xdefaults modifications. I have Netscape set so that
clicking and releasing button 3 returns to the previous page whereas
clicking and holding button 3 while moving the pointer brings up the
menu. The following is in my Xdefaults file and enables this behavior: 

Netscape*drawingArea.translations:              \
        <Btn3Down>: \n\
        <Btn3Down>,<Btn3Up>: xfeDoCommand(back)\n\
        <Btn3Down>,<Btn3Motion>: xfeDoPopup()\n\
        <Btn3Up>:                       ActivatePopup() \n\

What is the corresponding syntax for Mozilla? Thanks!

If there is a way to hide the sidebar by clicking an 'X' there should
also be a way of showing it again without wading through the menus.

Here's a suggestion:
A small knob or arrow on the extreme bottom left of the
toolbar (near the 'back' button). When you click on the arrow, the
sidebar
slides out, and the arrow is transported in a modified form
(looking as if it's saying "click to hide") to the sidebar's top-right
corner. Clicking it makes the sidebar slide back and the arrow goes
back to it's earlier form. The View menu option should remain, though.

Animating the sidebar's sliding out will be nice, but might be a little
tough implementing in XUL/CSS/Js (it'll probably hog system resources).

Looks like there's light at the end of the tunnel at last.
Have a look at:
http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1005-200-1576572.html?tag=st.ne.1002.thed.1005-200-1576572

Hopefully this should bring a lot more traffic to mozilla.org and these
newsgroups.

Maybe you should have a good look at
news://news.mozilla.org/8bci7p%24v23%40secnews.netscape.com

Mozilla's ui is based upon XUL, an XML based language, and it's
appearence
is determined by CSS. As a result, all the ui files (in bin/chrome) are
in plain text format (with .xul , .css and .js extensions). To create a
skin,
all you have to do is edit some of the .css files and change the
graphics files.
See the url specified above for more.

[posted in .general only -- the moderator]

I am planning on making a Personal Organizer (like Lotus) for Mozilla code
named Hydra (For lack of a better name :) ). It might not be made in time
for
the first release of Mozilla and I probably won't start it immediately. I am
still planning. I already have people that are willing to help. I also need
to learn more about how the code for Mozilla works (I'm new at this). If
anyone wants to get in at this early stage, feel free. If you do a
reasonable portion of the planning, I will make you co-owners (at max 2
people - I already have one co-owner). If you want to just help me but don't
want to commit, just tell me and I will let you know when we need your help.

**Please reply to boberb@rpi.edu even if you post a response on the board.
Thank you.

The default skin for Mozilla is kind of devoid of colors and the button bar
is blah. I really wish someone could make it more colorful and get those
ugly stripes of the . Also, the progress bar should have the dark and light
sections gradient filled so it looks nicer. Skins should be as easy to add
and create as for Winamp Mp3 player and should be able to have such things
as animations, moveable buttons, linked external code for extensibility. A
text file should define the layout of the skin. Also, I think the Mozilla
animation should run all the time if toggled in prefs. (People like me that
have very very fast internet connections never see it) :( It is really cool!

My friend is great at making shockwave files and would like to create a
shockwave startup screen (featuring the dinasour and fire of course) :) . If
he made it and it looked cool, would it be added to Mozilla and would he get
credit? He could make an animated GIF if a shockwave would be no good (ie
not portable), but then there could be no sound and it would have to have
8-bit color. What do you think? If he did so(and every one liked it), could
he also make the startup screen for the commercial version?

Try going rampant on a lot of software clicking on tons of buttons really
quickly and it will crash many programs. IE5.0, Outlook, Communicator and
many other programs have died due to my crazy click test. Mozilla (last
nights build) survived. Even when clicking back ultra-fast.
Next is my memory drain test!

Mozilla needs an Easter Egg. I recommend that if you hold click and left
click on the Mozilla animation in the upper right corner of the browser and
then drag it to the web address text box, MOZ will appear in the box. If you
then drag the icon in that text box to the Mozilla animation, ILLA will
apear in the box. Then if you press enter in the box, the easter egg will
start. It will first show a short movie of godzilla attacking tokyo then it
will show the credits of every person who worked on the Mozilla project and
what component they worked on (only coders and people who designed graphics,
etc...). If instead of hitting enter, you typed :MSPONG so the text bar said
MOZILLA:MSPONG, you would play the old fashion pong from the 70's. There
would only be one difference - instead of the pong ball, there would be Bill
Gates's head. Anyway, every good program needs a pong Easter Egg heh heh :)

-Just typing in MOZILLA wouldn't cut it. You would have to follow the steps
outlined.

You still didn't answer my question. Would you take a serious look at his
Mozilla startup screen if he made it (he's an EMAC student - that should say
enough).

That doesn't help. I need to know if his startup screen for Mozilla would
get a serious look at. (Otherwise why make it?)

I could write the code for the Easter Egg, but unfortunately, I would have
to make it a seperate program and wouldn't be able to link it in and it
wouldn't be OS independent. I don't know how to write Mozilla code at the
moment. I wanna learn.

On the last milestone, we should go crazy with easter eggs heh heh. I don't
understand how the first person's sarcastic response and the other people
talking about the Communicator startup have anything to do with the Mozilla
startup. Mozilla and Communicator are two different software. Mozilla will
be freeware, and communicator will be commercial/fee. I don't understand
what is wrong with animated GIFs, Flash, AVIs or anything else in the splash
screen. Please explain. Thank you.

BTW - a hydra is a small sea faring creature that has long, stinging
tenticles that grab prey and feed it into the mouth. (It is related to the
polyp stage of a jellyfish). It is also a greek monster that had (surprise!)
huge tenticles and devoured helpless humans whole (I wonder where they got
the inspiration?). Anyway, I thought the tenticles of the hydra would be
analogous to the Hydra module grabbing data and organizing it. Anyway, that
is where I got the name from. Hopefully, this module won't  devour people.
It was visioned a couple of days ago. The reason over it is anger over the
fact that other communications software (such as Outlook) have small
organizers and there is nothing of that sort for Mozilla. I think between
this and Mail/news there will be no reason to use outlook anymore. Other
organizers could also be passed in functionality and stability since Mozilla
has something that makes code developed fast yet be very good- a huge base
of programmers!

If I said this is going to be better than lotus then excuse me. I mean
lotus's organizer (which is pretty difficult to use for the first time, and
has a pretty lame calendar). This organizer will have nice dividers and a
quick launch tab in the My Toolbar (to launch components). Any of this
information could possibly be changed as planning goes forward. (I guarantee
some will). It will use Mozilla's profile management for protection of data.

Some preliminary info:

The module will be an organizer that will eventually be fusable with
Mozilla. It will contain the following components:

A task list - IE what to do on certain days you can assign a range of days -
or make it long-term with no set date. You can also set a time. It will have
alarms, etc.

A calendar - Each day will contain a notes section, a view of tasks for
today (from the task list), and an appointment schedule. There will also be
a long-term notes section. It will also have the ability to keep track of
special dates, such as your anniversary - so your wife doesn't kill you (if
your married), your friend's birthday, and the all important selection
sunday for NCAA :) Possibly, it might conform to standards of group
scheduling over the internet - if not, it will be a standalone calendar.

General notes section - contains just general notes.

*ALL NOTES WILL BE HTML COMPATIBLE LIKE MAIL MESSAGES*

A scientific calculator - there comes a time when a calculator comes in
handy that's easily excessible. Maybe in the future it can be a graphing
calculator (Just kidding).

Other parts. Any ideas?

It will work with mail/news project contacts (address book).

Much like the rest of Mozilla, javascript on web pages would have access to
the objects within this project, but of course nothing could be sent to or
from the page without the user's OK and the user would know exactly what the
page wanted to do (there would be a nice summary). That would rule out
malicous code and would give pages that announced events (like computer
shows in your area) the ability to make a link that adds the event to your
calendar, add notes, etc.

The project is currently in the speculation phase and needs more people to
move into the planning phase. A project page would be given if some useful
planning/history of project/etc. documents could be developed. CVS access
would be given once the code is in such a state that it can be added to the
tree. BTW - this project is here to stay. Even if I leave the scene (which I
doubt) I will find someone else to take it over for me. It is earmarked for
Release 2 of Mozilla 5 (Mozilla 5.1?) so there is plenty of time to work on
it. Is there anyone who would like to get in on the ground floor? I have
already replied to a few emails that show interest in the project. This will
be a large component of Mozilla (especially if web scheduling standards are
followed) and requires many devoted people to get anywhere. If you're free
then we need you.

This project marks another step to make Mozilla have more features (and
still be less buggy).

BTW - I never have written any Mozilla code though I've looked at the
source. For the time being, I will just be the one that organizes, replies,
and holds this project together. I promise that I will read all the
information about hacking Mozilla - I'm a quick learner. Please rub any
knowledge you have off on me :)

Would an animated splash screen take up so much processor time to
significantly slow the loading? If so, then maybe the animation could be
placed in the about box.

He is not a programmer. He is an EMAC student. He does multimedia. I'd be
able to put it in the help>about screen for him and give him credit. He
wanted an idea for a movie he could work on and I told him that he might be
able to make a movie for Mozilla. He does not want work, he wants something
to do.

I don't think you are being fair. What is wrong with wanting to make
something? He is not a programmer (he barely knows C++) so how would he get
involved with the project other than by making a movie?

I would have never guessed that the chromes were written in XML. What a
surprise! I think that is a smart idea. If a program can be written that
visually edits XML and still presents the versatility of writing it by hand
(and allows javascript code to be included) I'm all for it. It would have to
be a really good program (better than Communicator's composer).

I think you have a very valid point. A lot of arguing over little things
could lose the grand focus and slow the project.

Just a little update:

I am looking for one more person to take an active role in the early part of
this project - someone with much experience with Mozilla and vision. Anyone
free? We are now at the planning stage.

The PM will also contain a journal which keeps track of all completed tasks
and also has a daily note (so you can write important things that happened
that day).

Ideas are always accepted (and encouraged) but the final decisions of the
organization of the project will be made by a few people who have taken an
active role.

Right now we are planning what Hydra will contain, but I can answer one
common question now.

It will have a XUL/RDF interface and C++ code and will hopefully be fused in
with the CVS tree when it is completed.

Pretty soon, documents about the project will be at http://sourceforge.net .
I have not opened an account there as of yet.

Are there any plan how to cope with questions from users of the first
Beta of Netscape 6?

Technically, they are Mozilla users, and some posts might be useful for
development, but I fear, the vast majority are usual support questions
or bug reports and I'm feeling unable and unwilling to keep up with
that.

The newsgroups are the *only* channel to reach nearly all the developers
and the community and I fear, this connection will be lost, if the
newsgroups are flooded with Beta support questions.

So, are there plans to e.g. create new groups or to use any specific old
ones other than n.p.mozilla.*? If yes, what are the new chartas for
n.p.mozilla.*?

I think, it is not desirable to have bugs reported to newsgroups.
Explanations can be found at <news:38D7DB45.5FF89676@netscape.com> ("Re:
M14 thoughts" by Daniel Veditz in n.p.m.seamonkey) and
<news:38D9A049.A5200665@bucksch.org> ("Several answers" by me in
n.p.m.mailnews).

Can we add such a statement to the chartas
<http://www.mozilla.org/community.html>?

I just read in the charta <http://www.mozilla.org/community.html>: "The
mailing lists and newsgroups described here are for Mozilla developers,
not for end-users."

So, if there would be more widespread use of original Mozilla binaries,
we'd consequently have to create new groups.

No need for that.

I intend to post the following to <news:alt.netscape>,
<news:netscape.communicator> and any similar group you suggest. If you
have comments, please followup/reply.

---
n.p.mozilla.* newsgroups are dedicated to development on the open-source
Mozilla project, and not for end-users.

Mozilla is not equal to Netscape Communicator or Navigator anymore.
Although the newsgroups of the Mozilla project have "netscape" in their
name, they are not directly related to Netscape Communications other
than being hosted by Netscape's servers.

Before you post to these groups, please make yourself familar with the
Mozilla project, especially
- the website <http://www.mozilla.org>
- a recent Mozilla binary
- BugZilla
- the newsgroup chartas <http://www.mozilla.org/community.html>

*** *Posters to other groups*
Please make sure, that you don't accidently post to these groups by
replying to a cross-post.
***

Questions about Netscape Communicator 4.x will be ignored; please refer
to <http://home.netscape.com/support/index.html> for them.

Tnx Frank for filing the bug.

I posted to the newsgroup, because I wasn't sure, if everyone agrees.
BugZilla is just not the right tool for discussions.

That's why I would be careful with the part "or to make suggestions to
mozilla.org staff" in your proposed wording:
<quote src="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33427">
Also note that you can use Bugzilla to report problems with the
mozilla.org servers (including Bugzilla, Tinderbox, and Bonsai) or to
make suggestions to mozilla.org staff, by filing your bug against the
product "mozilla.org".
</quote>
If "suggestion" is just polite word for assigning a task (e.g. "Update
page xy, which is completely outdated"), we should find a better wording
IMO. Otherwise, I suggest to remove it.

That's good to hear.  Personally, I thought the bars were slick.  The
tabs are fugly.  Let the Netscape brand keep the tabs, but the average
mozilla user isn't going to be a newbie who needs a tab to understand
how the sidebar works.

2 megs?  the copy of the leak I got was 16Megs flat out.  Java 2 is to
blame, I suspect.  Don't get yer panties in a bunch, it's only slightly
different from mozilla M14, and it still crashes more than 4.72.

No offense to the netscape brand, of course.  Perhaps an option could be
implemented in the more mature stages.  Except for possible bloat, I
think the best solution is to allow for as many choices and as much
customization as possible.

Mozilla has more standards support than NS4.x.. 4.7 is a gettinging a bit
obsolete..
The example works fine in Mozilla and IE5..

I saw this for the first time in build 2000030416:
1- My site (slow server) dropped my .js file, so a javascript procedure
was not availablewhen needed. Things happen.

2- However, the following alert appeared:

          "This error may indicate that the site has not been
          updated for Mozilla. Please contact the site
          administrator, or see
          http://developer.netscape.com/mozilla"

      This is the wrong thing to say, and positions Mozilla as a
"Problem Child."
      This will almost certainly result in misunderstandings and
confusion, and will not cause developers to rush to support Mozilla.
      The alert should say that there was an error loading the
javascript for the page, rather than attacking the site's designers.
(Note - if a site does not take Moz into account, it is MOST likely to
manifest in bad browser-sniffing, which will not be caught by said
trap.)
(By The Way... what ever happened to the javascript console?? We need
this...)

Also, on caching...
Once build 2000030416 cannot load a .js or .css, they stay missing,
refusing to reload even though the files ARE available, and corrupting
display of pages which previously used them.
2000030113 did not exhibit this behaviour.

     I would not say that. The net is a tempermental beastie and it is
not at all unusual for a file to temporarily go -missing-. I would not
refer to this as an "unusual edge case."
     The net is supposed to be fault tolerant - you must PLAN a safe
failsafe if a needed file fails.
     A missing '.css' just renders like crap without the need to pop an
alert box. It might actually be cool if an alert popped up stating "SOME
STYLE DEFINITIONS WERE UNABLE TO BE LOAD, THIS DOCUMENT MAY NOT DISPLAY
CORRECTLY" or some such...

     I Disagree - the MOST likely cause is simply buggy code, or missing
files (or crreped-out files due to dropped packets...).. there IS a lot
of it about...
    What I meant to suggest above is that the most common manner in
which a site will fail to accomodate Moz is this: Bad browser detection.

    Much bad browser detection will make it through the interpreter just
fine (Version string checking, which is the most common method of
browser detection used.) This may NOT cause the dreaded calls to .all or
.layers, but simply result in a dumbed-down page or a "this browser not
supported page."

    I would might welcome an alert which triggered specifically on calls
to .all or .layers, but to trigger it for every Javascript error (or
every nonexistant function) would be uncalled for, misleading, and
annoying..

    Also, it might be better to point out that the site does not support
the W3C spec, rather than the particular browser... put the 'blame'
clearly on non-standard-compliant web-coders, rather than some
pain-in-the-butt browser which must be specifically accomodated (this is
what this next-level stuff is supposed to obviate...).

See above - what should be emphasized is that the sites need to comply
to the W3C STANDARDS, not an upstart-browser. The perception that Moz is
a problem which must be specifically coded for will put a stake through
this thing's heart faster than you can say "ouch!"

I certainly agree on many, many points.. see

    Yeah, CNN's browser detection code is busted... their "mycnn.com" site
lets you get quite a ways in before it suddenly decides to tell you your
browser is unrecognized.
    CNN would make a good candidate for a hi-visibility "update your site's
code" campaign

In the main browser, select the View menu, and deslect "Sidebar" ;)

Might it not be better to add an <X> to the right of "customize"? No use eating up
the right-click menu's space.
    But, if someone is looking to add right-click options, consider "send page,"
as soon as Mail is up to it...

Into the Mozilla/bin directory...

FWIW, I install the most recent talk-back version, then drop the
nightlies on top of that.
Can anyone tell me if this is a safe practice
Is the crash-data sent back to the coders good, or does the data get
mungled by putting a nightly atop it?
When (rarely, these days) I have a crash, talkback sends something
back... I would hate to be sending polluted info back, and have gotten no
complaints...

    And I'm (along with Tom, Dick, and Larry, thiguberrymucth! ) interested in learning how to do chrome for Mozilla, and and find the .ui and .xpfe groups

How does document.write affect your style-sheets?
Got an example??

Where is it?
There was an earlier thread complaining about the wording in this
dialog...
In subsequent builds, javascript errors are completely silent
I can find no preference to turn javascript error notification on (rude
wording and all...)
What happened?

By the way, in looking through prefs.js I found the following:
user_pref("browser.show_about_as_stupid_modal_window", true);


Not only does typing "about:" not result in a modal dialog, but this
pref badly needs to be renamed.
I wonder if there are other prefs with names like

               "somepref.only_idiots_do_this,true"
               "somepref.goddam_mac_weenies,true"
               "somepref.I_hate_billgates,true"

Such comments are out of place and out of line.
If you're going to express yourself do it BY the code you write, not IN
the code you write.

If you ever find yourself coding a function you despise to the point of
putting snide comments in the code, perhaps that code should be handed
off to somone else, since you're obviously not the right person to
implement said function.

Tho "old" way, listing error message in the status-bar combines usefulness and unobtrusiveness

This is a very neat feature, with 2pla problems.
1- No OBVIOUS way to reactivate an image
2- Context-sensitivity is wrong...the option appears regardless of
wether the clicked object is an image.

very cool feature, tho!

Right! The option should be little lower in the list...

    From snooping in nsContextMenu.js, it appears that there is a pref
called "imageblocker.enabled" which can be used to turn this feature on
and off. I don't see such an entry in prefs.js or lipref.js...
    Presumably, such an entry could be added to the file to disable this
if desired.

    L. Dorado makes one called Fountain. They also produce Grailmail and
Ark-i-text. These all work exactly the same on all systems.

    Other than those packages, true x-plat does not exist yet.

That 3% matters to some people.
The person to whom I was replying was complaining that nothings runs EXACTLY
the same across platforms.
Since we do not live in/on a perfect world, I was attempting to gently point
out that there will be minor differences no matter what the software is.

    FWIW, I am WELL aware of the existance of Mozilla, and am pretty danged
gung-ho about it. I'm also aware that perfection (which seemed to be what the
prior poster was asking for) is unattainable.

Sheesh!

Well, it'll never be as simple as Winamp, given the sheer breadth of Mozilla,
but it WILL be skinnable/extensible out the wazoo.

It'll take a bit more than that! :^)  ( Take a look in bin/chrome...)

How many files, pray tell? Mozilla has 1344 files in the chrome
directory!!

> Using one file for skins is a new thing.

     As far as I can tell the post-beta version will use a single .jar
file for distribution of chrome, put jar-ing / unjar-ing is no big deal.
Kinda like zip-unzip...

Hey, pull the files out of the jar (when implemented) and go to town!!

1344 files, all edited by hand? Are you on drugs?
Should there be programs that visually edit html? Should IDE's never
have been invented?
Seriously... no such app will be REQUIRED, but I'm fairly certain that
such will be developed.
	I repeat, look in the bin/chrome directory...

That it how it is done.

Well, into the chrome _hierarchy_.

In keeping RFC 2717, any schemes that Mozilla is introducing should
*not* be under the IETF tree. Looking at 3.3 of said RFC, it looks like
"chrome" and the like should be changed to something along the lines of
"mozilla-chrome".

Do you think MS would make their VM compatible with Mozilla? Sun's VM is
always based on the latest version of Java so it's the logical choice for
platforms that it is available for. If MS made theirs compatible with
Mozilla AND the latest version of Java then maybe it would be a better
choice. I don't see it happening though.

I have a query about the various swiches used to start up Mozilla (-edit
for Ender, -mail for Messenger...).  These used to be all handled in
nsApprunner, but sometime recently seemed to have been stripped out and
replaced with a different implemenation.

Would it be possible to get a brief summary of what goes on now during
start-up.  Where is the parameter checking occuring, and what function
are they passed to, to launch the application.  I was thinking
particularly about the editor.  Is this now handled in
nsEditorService.cpp?  

Is it possible to add your own component, using a different comand line
switch (e.g. '-myapp') and pass chrome URL to start up with?

That's great info Seth.  I have a look at it at the weekend, and

This is all very straightforward and easy to follow, but presumes that
you have your own component / class.  All I would like to do is start up
the editor component with a different chrome module, while leaving the
editor start up alone.

So would it be possible to have some sort of conditional in
nsEditorService.cpp that checks the switch before it passes the
arguments?  Or would it just be easier to write my own class?

Or should I be doing it one of these ways?  The JS sounds very
interesting.

Is there a way in NETLIB to see what page is viewed when a resource is
cached?  E.g, I could be viewing www.yahoo.com/index.html and the cached
image could be from doubleclick.com.  I need to be able to see yahoo.com
somehow.  Of course this may become more messy when you consider  frames
and multiple windows (I don't know if this is the case), but any help
you have would be GREATLY appreciated for some research that's coming
due.. :)
Thanks,

   I have a quick question for the community.  I'm a contractor with a
company where SVGs are their core business.  I have always been
impressed with the Mozilla project and I would love nothing more than to
help contribute to it.  My question, is Mozilla still looking for the
necessary pieces to be able to use SVGs?  From what I have read around
here, the limited amount on Mozilla.org, and the obvious that the
Mozilla browser doesn't natively support SVGs yet, there is still some
work to do.   I might be able to make a case for this company to
contribute its labor and code to help Mozilla along.

   So before I try to get anyone at work fired up, I want to make sure
that this need hasn't already been met, i.e. next release or near
future.  If it hasn't, do you have any idea who I could talk to to get
us started and aligned with current Mozilla/SVG efforts?

thanks in advance,
BK

OK,
	Still trying to find a beta copy of Netscape 6 (128 bit

ftp site.  Can anybody point me in a certain direction?

Hi - 

I've got some pages which use <EMBED> to play DIVX encoded AVI files.

One of these is -

http://www.serve.com/douglass/games/cs_gallery/page2.html

(To see the anim you need DIVX installed - http://divx.ctw.cc/ ).

This works fine with Netscape 4.7 and IE 5.5.

I've just installed 6b3 and no go.

I tried using <OBJECT> but that failed too.

I set up a MIME type as appropriate for the <EMBED> tag (it's using 
"application/x-mplayer2") but that didn't help.

Help? :)

So, you don't even have enough startup capital to pay developers, your
business plan is based around entering an already saturated market, and
your primary revenue source will be web-based advertising.

Why? Did you just decide one day that there aren't enough masochists in

if talkback itself crashes when it starts up,
it is usually corruption in your blackbox configuration files,
or an incompatibility between the blackbox configuration files
and the version of the talkback client you have installed.

you can try just removing
C:\Program Files\Netscape\Communicator\Program\FullSoft\Data>permdata.box

or some of of the steps explained in this article
http://help.netscape.com/kb/consumer/19990914-1.html

Seamonkey users that install over the top of an existing installation
might also have some small exposure to this problem.

namachi@netscape.com can provide the latest status on
the things that are possible, and not possible, running
the talkback client behind various proxies, and firewalls.

there is some information here, but updates may be needed.

This man knows what runs smoothly and what does not!. ;-)

He has submitted more Seamonkey talkback crash reports than
any other person in the universe by a two to one margin.....

Yes,  we can easily throw away the dups, or use good
judgment to tell us about the frequency users might
encounter any given problem, over time our database
analysis tools of the talkback reports are getting better
and more refined...

You can't give us too many crash reports.  Keep 'em comin'

thanks .

There are quite a few folks running both that I know of,
but there would be less certainty about if there are any
order of installation problems.  We definitely would want
to know if this is a widespread problem.

What kind of errors do you see?

Can you file a bug so we can track this?

thanks.

I am writing a simple cool XUL hack for Mozilla.
So far, I've written the XUL which was clean and easy.
But I'm stuck on a JavaScript nub.

In Navigator 4 getSelection() gets the current selection
from a document.  This doesn't work with Mozilla.
How does one do this in Mozilla?

In general, is there a reference for Mozilla JavaScript
I should be looking at?

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 7bit

I'm at an alpha point with a cool XUL tool I wrote.

A user selects some text and then chooses from an Action menu
an action to perform on the text. Possible actions are

    web search
    page search
    dictionary lookup
    address to map lookup
    language-to-language translation

The menu is described in XUL. It calls an embedded Javascript
handler which gets the selection, creates an encoded request url,
and opens it. This all works now modulo some Mozilla bugs.
I have to use static text in place of the results of getSelection
but other than that it is demonstrable.

I'm attaching the files if you want to test it:

    chrome/navigator/content/default
        action.js
        navigator.xul
        navigatorOverlay.xul

Select some text.  Hit Action->Translate->English to French

There are currently lots of open performance bugs which have a high
priority, so this will definitely improve during the next few weeks.
Take a look at Chris Watersons laundry-list( note that it hasn't been
updated for some time):

Actually, I've yet to see a page which renders faster with NN4.x than
with Mozilla's viewer (there are some worst-case-scenarios to see which
area needs performance improvements, but no real Internet web pages).
Especially nested tables render 10x as fast. I agree that there have to
be some improvements on the XUL-interface, though.

Performance wasn't that much of a priority up until some weeks ago (of
course the architecture of Mozilla was developed with performance in
mind, but there were no heavy optimizations). Now that the APIs have
stabilized, performance tuning starts to make sense, and there were some
significant speedups during the last month, in all Mozilla components,
especially if Netscape wants to release a beta to a wider audience in
about a month.

In the course of configuring and using the Netscape Enterprise Server
software, we have discovered that there is no single mailing list
dedicated to this complex application, and that the traffic on the
"netscape.server" newsgroup is too low to be useful. We would have
benefited (and still would benefit) greatly from a list dedicated to the
configuration and administration of the Netscape Enterprise Server
software, and we believe that others using this software would find such
a resource highly useful.

Consequently, we have decided to host, on an experimental basis, a list
dedicated to discussing problems related to the Netscape Enterprise
Server software.  We invite all interested in participating to
subscribe.

To subscribe, please send an e-mail (no subject needed) to: 

majordomo@lists.veritel.com.br  

with the following text in the first line of the body of the message: 

subscribe nes-managers-l [<your e-mail address>]


Because this list is experimental, we are not, for the moment, hosting
archives for the list.


(Please note that, aside from being a user of software produced by
Netscape, we have no association with Netscape, and this list has not
been endorsed by nor has any connection with Netscape.)

Details?   There is a Irix 5.3 tinderbox running on the SeaMonkey-Ports
page, http://tinderbox.mozilla.org/SeaMonkey-Ports/.  It uses a small
patch to NSPR that hasn't been checked in though.

I don't know. People today are too much into instant gratification. I
have a 486DX2-66 that runs 4.61 quite happily if a little slowly. The
lighter weight Mozilla should run a bit better. It is sobering to
realize that the main machine on my network is blazingly fast compared
to many machines I used in the 1980's (P150) and when I check process
use, top is almost always the biggest cpu use process (X will perk up if
I wiggle the mouse)!

Since encryption has come along and it is probable that the Netscape
branded version will have encrypted news capability, it is probably best
to continue to chase users asking questions here to the already high
traffic support groups on snews://secnews.netscape.com. The questions
will be handled there and any real bugs (rather than pilot error) will
be reported after being verified. The support groups have worked for
several years and support experience is found there. If traffic to a
single group gets out of hand, there are a number of us who can request
a group split (we have done this from time to time).

The bottom line is that there is structure in place so use it.

4.xx problems should not be discussed here but rather in
snews://secnews.netscape.com/netscape.communicator.* or the special Mac
group.

No such animal as a complex application with no bugs.

That was not a bug but rather a decision that it wasn't needed or used.
It was a mistake to think that since some people did use the sort
feature. There were no resources to put it back in after the mistake was
made. Their are third party applications that do it or you may use 3.04
to do it.

The features you are talking about were not in 1.xx because it had no
mail. The mail and news architecture of 2.0x and 3.0x was not even
similar to that of 4.xx so the whole thesis doesn't wash.

Why not use the Sun JVM on everything? That insures it is standard.

There exist creatures called Netscape Champions. This organization was
founded by Netscape and I am one of the first five members. The first
Champion meeting in Mountain View was in 1996 with only three attending.
The second, in 1998, had more like 20 or so attending and there were
several productive exchanges with engineering. Unfortunately, Jay was
not able to attend because of business matters. Jay, however, is a
Netscape Champion of long standing. You can find out more about the
Champions by visiting http://help.netscape.com/ and looking for links to
Nuggies. Jay is the main contributor to the UFAQ, http://www.ufaq.org/ ,
which has existed for longer than the Netscape Champions.

First, these groups are not a place to discuss Netscape 6 issues since
the Netscape branded version is distinct from Mozilla. Second, the beta
of Netscape 6 will likely be treated the way previous betas were. Most
people who download it will understand that a beta may have problems.
That is what beta testing is for. Finally, to influence a project in a
useful way, it is better to make suggestions and discuss them
rationally. Continuous griping for the sake of griping is a good way to
get yourself into a lot of killfiles.

Different file system but Linux knows about different file systems.
There are a couple of solutions that work and the original poster should
post the question in
snews://secnews.netscape.com/netscape/communicator/unix for details from
people who do it.

On my RedHat 6.1 Linux box, I downloaded and installed the new M14 kit. Then
I installed the PSM stuff. It said it all installed just fine. I exited and
restarted Mozilla. But when I try to browse to a secure page nothing
happens. If I click on the padlock in the bottom right corner, after about
10 seconds I get a window that contains "Socket Error 10049".

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

Colin.

Using build 2000030516 (win95) I find that this dialog is being brought
up several times for each page, and then crashing the browser.  This
happens on our intranet site, and also on http://www.ft.com.

Having the dialog appear once per domain (ever *not* each time you visit
the thing!) might be a better solution...

How about a user preference to suppress Javascript errors?  How many end
users (as apposed to developers) want to see this message when they view
a web site?  I know the idea is to get people to update their web pages,
but if an error dialog pops up each time you visit your favorite site it
may end up slowing down adoption of Mozilla.

I can agree with this, it isn't the biggest priority, and as a temporary
measure it does work.  The two things that worries me most at the moment
about this are:

1 - It's poping up too many times per page (this might be fixed by the
checkin Mike McCabe referred to but it's still doing it in build
2000030516 - maybe tonights build will fix it).  At this point I don't
know how many times it will pop-up for pages because of point 2.

2 - I can't visit sites like www.ft.com because when you do the dialogue
appears repeatedly, and then Mozilla crashes after dissmissing the 3rd
dialog on the page.  This could of course be un-related, but until it
stops doing this I can't use Mozilla for web browsing.

I'm writing about this here not to complain, but to make sure that
people are aware of the problem with the crashing, which I've not seen
reported either here or in Bugzilla (which doesn't mean it's not there -
searching for javascript brings back a few bugs...)

Colin.

Whooops!  My humble apologies to the Mozilla community for not clearly 
understanding your respective missions.  So that I don't risk being off-
topic in future postings, may I inquire if it is okay to post to the
	netscape.public.general
group?  I prefer to use my own newsreader, and surely Netscape has at 
least one group accessible independent of their home page, yes?  And 
thank you to Kostas for contributing useful information.

Yes and no....

The DEFAULT file systems, no.

You could mount a FAT32 drive in Linux to put the mail on, however. You
CAN'T do it the other way around.

I'm currently  making a programe to compare web pages in two seperate
browsers. 
One of the methods I wish to compare these are an image to image
comparisson. 
I currently use the -remote 'saveAs({$url}.ps,PostScript)' kommand
but this doesn't save any background images . 

Any one knows a way to do this
(I'm currently using netscape 4.72 , but lower version solutions will be
accepted :))

I've had Mozilla installed for some time & upgrade it at the
milestones.  It was working fine til a couple of days ago, now I can't
get mail or news.  I get an "unknown error 80004005" when I try to
get into my mail or news accounts.  I have 2 profiles an the error comes
up with both. I copied & pasted the bookmarks from NS 4.77 if that
matters.

I also get an an invalid page fault error when I try to start NS 6.01.
The error says "NETSCP6 caused an invalid page fault in module
GKHTML.DLL at 0167:6025059f."  Don't know if the 2 are connected but
they started at the same time.  NS 6.01 had also been working fine.

I posted to the NS 6.01 group several days ago & haven't received any
responses so I figured since it involved Mozilla, I'd try posting here.

Thanks,

Nancy

If you've got the time and inclination, profiling trouble spots would
be very helpful.  See <http://www.mozilla.org/performance/> for
details on tools and hints that can be used for this.  I'd suggest
either picking your favorite performance gotcha, or choosing a bug
from <http://www.mozilla.org/performance/laundry-list.html> and using
profiling tools to find where the bottlenecks are, and then adding
any relevant information that you dig up to the bug in question.
<news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.performance> is also
a good forum used to discuss this stuff.

I've just checked in and turned on a new feature in bugzilla: user
watches.  The idea here is that if someone goes on vacation, you may
need to cover for them while they're gone, but don't want to have all
their bugs reassigned to you and have to manually add yourself to bugs
where they are CCed.

Now, you can go into your bugzilla email preferences, and enter their
email address into your watch list, and anytime they are sent mail by
bugzilla, you'll be sent mail also.  As with the existing bugzilla code,
this respects bug permissions, so if you don't have permission to view a
certain bug, you won't get any mail about it just because you happen to
be watching someone who does have permission.

If you have any problems, please file a bug and assign it to me.  More
details about the guts of this checkin will be posted to
mozilla.webtools shortly.

Dan

I agree! If this feature does somehow make it into Mozilla I see
Netscape using a Castle Rock Entertainment style start up, where the
lighthouse actually spins and flashes light across the screen
(http://www.castle-rock.com/).

Since you are using Linux, create a script called runmo.sh to do this...

#!/bin/bash
cd $HOME/mozilla/package
./mozilla

To understand how to use the Bash shell and write scripts, read up on it 
in the Linux Documentation Project at http://www.linuxdoc.org

See the Bash Prompt HOWTO
http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prompt-HOWTO.html

Have you tried an alternate shell as suggested in the bug?

4DOS/4NT will redirect stderr with >& instead of the usual >, and
various unix-shell emulators (bash comes free in cygwin, for example)
will do this also.

The standard MS command shells won't, however.

WinNT performance is pretty good; it's improving but still sucks on
Win9x. I think that explains your differing experience.

Then what *are* you running? The performance of debug builds is *really*
bad. The official M13 was OK, then the nightly builds got severely worse
for a while, then the problem was found and recent M14 builds are faster
again.

Mozilla loads most Communicator-style plugins just fine. It will look in
a "plugins" directory below the executable just as Communicator does.

I think it will also load plugins found in a COmmunicator installation.
I'm not sure if that's a permanent feature or was just a development
time thing.

You can, of course, simply disallow window.open() from any or all sites.

(there is no UI for this "power user" feature, but hopefully someone will
figure that out one of these days.)

Components can use the newish nsCategoryManager to register themselves as a
command-line handler. I don't know where this is documented though. You can
use the "regExport" utility to dump the registry and see what kind of
category data is in there already.

Alternatively, if you register your component as an AppShellComponent you
get handed a nsICmdLineService in the Initialize() call.

No, you set permissions entirely through per-user prefs.  You'd only have
to tweak the source if you wanted to control an access that wasn't
foreseen. It looks like
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/dom/public/nsDOMPropNames.h is the
list of the valid properties, and if so that's pretty much everything.

First, your component must implement nsIAppShellComponent, documented at
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/components/public/nsIAppShellComponent.idl

Second, your component's self-register must make an entry in the component
registry. You can see how xpinstall does it at
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpinstall/src/nsSoftwareUpdate.cpp#561

Contrary to the documentation in the first link, the appshell components I
know of all register their CID not their ProgID. I don't know if that means
we're all broken (but the component manager can deal with it) or if the
documentation is out of date.

No doubt if the CategoryManager had existed at the time this would have
been implemented as a category instead of a custom implementation.

The capabilities system works by restricting access to properties of
standard DOM objects. Other than window.open() the things you list are
events which would require that somebody create a different mechanism.

This discussion should really move to the netscape.public.mozilla.security
newsgroup if it's going to delve into more details or requests.

Unfortunately not likely to be tomorrow.

The crypto stuff comes in two parts. The "Netscape Personal Security
Manager" will remain available only as a binary from iPlanet for quite a
while since it contains patented RSA code.  See
http://www.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/ for details

But that part doesn't change often. The HTTPS protocol code that's part of
mozilla itself and talks to PSM to get it's crypto done will eventually be
part of the nightly builds, but probably not until after the beta because
of the stability push.

Obviously no one here has ever heard of Kaixi Search Engine, most of us
can't even read that site.  Have you tried asking *them* what they've done
to your system? In fact, how *did* they alter your system -- did you
install something? Did they bring up a Java permission dialog to do
something?

How you got the toolbar in the first place would be a big clue.

If you installed something maybe they added a plugin. check about:plugins
and see, and if you have one you should be able to remove it. If it's not a
plugin then it's gotta be something that always present on your system,
check your startup items, and the "Run" key in the windows registry.

Basically you're asking people questions about stuff they know nothing
about. Flooding the group with everyone saying "I don't know" is not
helpful, so people are silent. The Kaixi people would know, and their site
no doubt has a feedback mechanism. If you did not give them permission to
install this then I STRONGLY urge you to use that feedback mechanism to
indicate your displeasure.

I'm not saying anything about what Netscape will ship. I was responding to
a post that indicated hope for seeing it in the *mozilla.org* binaries.

It's quite likely that the Netscape browser will have no legal problems
shipping with the "Netscape Personal Security Manager" :-)

(disclaimer: despite my @netscape.com address I know little more about this
security stuff than I've read in places like the link I gave above -- feel
free to read it for yourself and make your own conclusions.)

-225 is EXTRACTION_FAILED, which only comes up in a couple of places.
Basically either something bad happened trying to decompress that file out
of the archive (a corrupt archive? But not *too* corrupt or we wouldn't
have gotten this far -- we are already processing the install script at
this point) or it couldn't create the destination file.

If you're sure your disk isn't full and you don't have read-only files or
directories in the way you might try downloading it again. Otherwise I'm
kind of stumped without more info and probably would need to run a debugger
on your system. :-(

We are well aware. Performance on Win 9x is definitely way worse than Win
NT, especially on slow machines and with limited memory (not your problem).
I think our "slow" machine is a 166Mhz, not 133Mhz, but we *are* testing in
your ballpark and are trying to solve the problem.

Good thing you've got as much memory as you do, it could be worse :-)

You didn't answer the question about how much disk space you had free.
Could that be the problem?

In the directory with mozilla.exe you should find a file called
"install.log" -- could you post what it says about one of the times you
attempted to install PSM?

Both.

We stopwatch things, investigate trouble spots with various profilers, and
have sections of code instrumented to output timings when certain switches
are set (either compiled in, or runtime switches in debug builds).

Officially March 30 at 10pm. PBS stations seem to have quite a bit of

In particular bugs with "help wanted" in the keywords (or was it status
whiteboard?) field are not being looked at by anyone at the moment, so you
don't have to worry about duplicating work. Ditto for bugs assigned to
"nobody@mozilla.org".

Once you've found a bug that's in an area that looks interesting to you you
can post to a  newsgroup relevant to that part of the product asking for
hints about where that part of the code is handled.  Then set some
breakpoints and watch the control flow for that part of the product.

Crashes may be the easiest bugs to find. Sometimes the cause is an obvious
code error right at the point it crashed, often you have to work backwards
trying to find where the bogus data came from, but at least you know where
to start looking.

"Open Source" code depends /heavily/ on copyright. It is only because
copyright forbids copying without the copyright holder's permission that we
can attach licenses that allow others to reproduce the code and product if
and ONLY if the copier follows a list of conditions we set down.

As far as I know, however, there have not been any open source "look and
feel" copyright registrations, just copyrights on source code and
documentation.  It could be done, I just don't think anyone has bothered or
come up with anything original enough yet.

Just because one particular case was won or lost does not mean any other
case would be decided the same way. The particulars are extremely important
in these kinds of things. You need to talk to a lawyer.

Yes. How could you know about Mozilla without knowing this? Netscape
obviously is one, but there are others as well. Nokia, IBM, Citec,
Neoplanet, etc.

> 4. If so what types of products would be commercially viable?

What do you mean by "commercially viable"? It would indeed be hard to sell
a plain Mozilla derivative if that's what you mean. In part because
competitors could start from the same open source, but more importantly
because Microsoft Internet Explorer is free and bundled with the OS for 90%
of desktop systems.

You could, however, use Mozilla as a component in some other kind of
product. Open source Mozilla frees you from having to re-invent the
"browser" wheel, but you still have to put the rest of the car together.

A get-rich-quick repackager is not going to make any money, but if you
create a significant and creative service or product using the browser you
have and deserve a shot.

It is apparently hip. I'm too old to get it.

Why anyone would want to appropriate the symbols of a /failed/ revolution
is beyond me. Although if Mozilla lasts 70 years like the USSR that'd be a
pretty good run for a piece of software.

The thinking behind netscape.public.dev.skins (and n.p.dev.xul etc) is that
you're not talking about developing mozilla itself, you're using mozilla
features to develop something else.

Why a netscape and not a mozilla group? Well, after the Netscape beta we
expect there may be a ton of people interested in these topics and they
would probably swamp the mozilla groups. Plus the content could get
repetitive as beginners cycle through, become the experts, and eventually
move onto other things while new beginners take their places.

Good or bad those groups already exist. You may find them useful.

Sorry if that sounded curt, wasn't intended that way. If you *don't* find
them useful then by all means come back and re-suggest creating a new group
:-)

The validators check syntax, your complaint is about behavior. There is
nothing incorrect about the way Mozilla handles ALT tags. See
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/objects.html#adef-alt

You want to use the title attribute for "tool-tip" like behavior:
http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/global.html#adef-title

The rest sound like things that should be filed in bugzilla.

It's been a source of argument.

There is a "quirks" mode that attempts to recognize non-standard but common
HTML syntax.

Maybe the .layout folks can fill you in on the mozilla philosophy towards
standard compliance.

Just a friendly reminder, cross-posting to the .general group is
discouraged (the "Ground Rules" at http://www.mozilla.org/community.html
put it a little stronger).

Since .general is the home for all topics that don't have another more
specific home it could easily get swamped if it also picks up threads that
belong elsewhere.  Besides, if you have a question about X and the folks
interested in X don't have an answer for you, the folks in the .general
group *not* interested in X aren't likely to either. (The folks in the
.general group interested in/knowledgable about X are already also reading
the X group.)

Thanks!

My guess is that's it's Mozilla bits built from the nscp_beta1_BRANCH,
which forms the basis for the commercial release.  Still interesting to
mozilla folks because it should be a pretty stable build, especially
compared to the badly spanked trunk builds at this point.

The n.p.m.license newsgroup is more appropriate for this thread -- setting
followups there.

One of the goals of the Mozilla Public License was to be compatible with
commercial products so you should be able to sell a larger work based on
Mozilla code. You do, however, have to obey the terms of the license.

I don't understand "license free". The license spells out the requirements
for redistribution of binaries based on covered source code. Could you get
more specific?

There is also a FAQ on license issues linked under
http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/

My impression is that mozilla.org is trying to do more the "right thing",
so they won't call it beta until it's feature complete.  Netscape, in fact,
is technically not calling this a "beta", it's a "Preview Release".

No one officially speaking for Netscape is telling customers to get new
computers. We know we have to run well on what's out there in order to
succeed.

It'd be cool if you also wrote a bug report in http://bugzilla.mozilla.org

We attack problems reported each way differently. Talkback tells us where
the program was executing when it crashed, so we can look at the code to
check for problems. But it isn't always obvious where the data came from
that was causing the problem. If you have an easily reproducable crash like
this it's usually easier to fix from a bug report.

It's the difference between being able to work on a car in the shop and
trying to piece together what happened from snapshots of a gruesome crime
scene.

Mozilla is not Godzilla. Netscape had to defend him from vicious lawyers on
this point at least once. 

Before Open Source gave him steroids and turned him into T. Rex he was a
cute anthropomorphic little lizard.

XUL itself, or the catch-phrase "There is no <X>, only Zuul"? For the
latter try http://www.xenafan.com/movies/ghostbusters/ and search for the
word Zuul.

For XUL in Mozilla try the docs at http://www.mozilla.org/xpfe/

The Netscape beta will not mention bugzilla. The Help menu will have links
that take people to Netscape support pages which will have feedback links
and links to newsgroups on Netscape's servers.

Some Netscape customers will no doubt find bugzilla anyway, either from
wandering around mozilla.org (after being linked there from the license
page) or from press articles ("Look, Ma -- write your own bugs!"). We're
trying to find ways to deal with it (example: the new "unconfirmed" bug
status).

Netscape hasn't done any active Java development in a couple of years, just
a few bugfixes. There is no java VM in the Mozilla codebase, but there is a
mechanism for plugging in 3rd party JVM's. I don't believe Netscape has
announced which Java they will be bundling with. Every mozilla vendor will
need to make their own deals with java vendors in order to bundle Java with
their mozilla distribution.

I can only fix the bugs I know about.

Since it works for the vast majority of people the failure cases are
interesting. Please file a bug describing your OS version, how far the
process got before it failed, and what error messages or failure modes you
saw.

I think people are re-evaluating the tabs, too. They did make the concept
more self-explanatory (with usability test data to back that up) but are
ugly and take up too much vertical space.

The netlib group is a more appropriate (and more effective) place to ask
this kind of question. Many developers avoid the .general group because the
signal-to-noise ratio is low; always look for a more specific forum first
before resorting to .general

followups set to the netlib group, check there for answers.

Install using the install program (on Mac and Windows, Unix will come
later) and you can simply not install the parts you don't want. Mail/news
in particular. The Editor is currently bundled with the browser, but that
will probably be an option you can deselect by beta2.

The sidebar can be turned off using the View menu. It's mostly just
XML/HTML and javascript, it's not taking up much diskspace and when it's
turned off it is *gone*.

On the preferences dialog there is a "Password Manager" section where you
can turn the password dialogs off.

Mozilla supports the same standardized object model IE does (our version is
more complete). Some sites have code to explicitly check for IE before
using DHTML and incorrectly block Mozilla users from that content as if it
were an older browser that couldn't handle it. We can only hope that the
site authors notice the beta hype and fix their sites before the final
version is shipped (it's usually just a minor one-or-two-line change).

Cool -- your top requests are already in there.

It has not been released. When it is I'm sure it'll be available from

You will get the best quality answers if you try to find the most specific
group applicable to your question, using the general group only if no other
group applies. Lots of the developers have abandoned the .general group due
to the volume of repetitive and off-topic (e.g. Communicator related)
posts.

I think multiple SMTP addresses is being worked on, but that's only a guess
on my part and it may have been cut for lack of time; try the mail-news
group. See http://www.mozilla.org/community.html for a list of groups and
topics.

We pulled off a minor miracle and the original March 31,1998 source code
did in fact build and run. It was missing lots of stuff, but it did run.
This could be seen in the recent "Code Rush" documentary on PBS.

But Peter asks about the more mature October version, before it was ditched
for the Gecko-based Mozilla. That one worked pretty well as a successor to
Communicator 4.x, but didn't support W3C standards any better. The source
is on mozilla.org, but I don't see any binaries before M3 of the new
codebase.

The original code was not called "Classic" at the time, it was just
"Mozilla". After the Gecko-based rewrite started we needed a distinguishing
name for the old source and the "MozillaClassic" CVS module was born.

Old news. Given the amount of 3rd-party and crypto code we had to rip out
we were faced with the choice of working in private for months to clean it
up or releasing as much as we could on the announced date to prove we were
serious and not just engaging in Microsoftian FUD.  Keep in mind that the
developers found out about open sourcing only a day or two before the
public did.

Which would you have done?

I do not wish to change my present e-mail client (Eudora 5.2), but I do 
want to use the
best browser.  It appears that Mozilla does not respect the system default 
handler for Mailto.  OK, I'm speaking Windoze and I don't know what the 
equivalent on an X*Nix system would be.

I wish to have Mozilla pass off any "mailto:" links to the Eudora composer, 
instead of its own.  Is this possible?

The 4.x address book upgrade code has not been turned on yet.

When it is turned on, the upgrade will only work with the Netscape 
builds, not the mozilla builds, because 4.x used a 3rd party database 
for the address book that mozilla doesn't have the rights to distribute 
in source code form.

This should be working sometime next week - all the code is checked in 
(except for the code in the profile migration component), and I'm 
waiting for some mac project help.

Netscape Communicator 4.72 (or 4.7) has now become unstable and keeps
crashing at random.  I am wondering whether it is caused by one of the
background programs running.  What *are* these programs which Windows
starts automatically?

I am running Win 95B with MS Office 97, and HP Officejet
Printer/Scanner, and software including Omnipage, and a Decision Tools
program called @Risk.

On booting up, the initial Windows screen [Desktop] has the following 10
programs running behind it:

1. Explorer
2. Systray
(these two appear to be essential)
3. Findfast
4. Dtole
5. Msmsgs
6. Osa
7. Loadwc
8. Opware16
9. Opware32
10. Procdb

In most cases I have no idea what they do or whether it is necessary for
these to start running automatically.

However, I think at least one is messing up my system:  Scandisk
continually restarts, Defragmenter takes a lot longer than it should
through restarting, and now Netscape Communicator 4.72 (or 4.7) has now
become unstable and keeps crashing at random.  When I shut some of these
background programs down using Control-Alt-Delete, the stability and
operation of these 3 programs improves.

The Start button / Programs / Start Up contains only three items:
Microsoft Find Fast (presumably number 3 in my list above);  Office
Start Up, and HP Picture Link (presumably part of my scanner software).

Any insight into:
1.  what these programs are, and
2.  how I can stop the unnecessary ones automatically starting up
would be welcome.

By the way, I am getting two types of crashes:
1.  Freezes  (often but not necessarily when sending email) - needs
reset button / Scandisk
2.  A blue DOS-type screen with a message which the computer shop tells
me indicates some incompatibility in the system caused by programs that
are running.
I have uninstalled and reinstalled Netscape several times.

David Fayle

Thanks Jerry

How can I stop FindFast and OSA (whatever that is) starting up - I really
don't want to have to use Control-Alt-Del all the time.

Thanks also Goofy - I will try your suggestion

Thanks Stephen

Unless OSA is "Office Start Up", it is not in my Start up folder - there =
are
only three things there - Microsoft Find Fast (presumably number 3 in my =
list);
Office Start Up, and HP Picture Link (presumably part of my scanner softw=
are).
What 5 of the other 7 programs running are, who knows?  There should be s=
ome way
of looking at a part of a file to find out what its function is and what
application it is attached to.

By the way, the crashes I am getting are of two types:
1. Freezes =96 requires pressing reset button.
2. A blue DOS-type screen with a message like this:
=93An exception 0E has occurred at 0028: C002 AFD6 in VxD IFSMGR(01) + 00=
00 38D2.
This was called from 0028:C104 CB0E in VxD VTDI(01) + 0000 00BA.  It may =
be
possible to continue normally.=94
(It never is, and sometimes I get one like this:)
=93A fatal exception 0E has occurred at 0028: C002 AFD6 in VxD IFSMGR(01)=
 + 0000
38D2.  The current application will be terminated.=94
Once this has happened, Communicator can usually be restarted but is alwa=
ys very
unstable, and to get it working at all, you need to re-boot.  After a cra=
sh like
this, I tried shutting down FindFast and OSA using Control-Alt-Del, then
restarting Communicator, but it was still unstable.

PS Goofy - I Tried your suggestion:  prefs.js is not read only on my syst=
em -
=93Archive=94 was selected.!

For a while I couldn't get to my Hotmail account via Netscape but - I
just noticed that I have two "accounts" in Netscape. One is Default and
the other is CSMDAVE. Using CSMDAVE I can get into Hotmail. Using
Default, I can't. They are both version 4.75.
Don't ask me why this happened but as soon as I get the nerve up, I will
delete Default

I have a bug that I plan to fix in M15 that will enable a package to define
itself as the primary browser.  This means it will be the one that is used for
window.open calls and be the one that launches initially.  So if aphrodite
properly makes itself a separate package, e.g., chrome://aphrodite/content/,
there will be a simple pref that you will be able to edit to make aphrodite your
default.

Hopefully aphrodite is structured this way.  If it's trying to overwrite the
navigator package rather than co-existing with the navigator package, then this
should be fixed.  Maybe Pete can comment.

I could really use help with this.

My Netscape Communicator (4.51) (Incl. browser, news and mail) has
developed some extremely irritating delays just recently.  Every minute
or so, whenever Netscape is on (whether I am actively using it or not)
it freezes for 7 seconds or so while it beats my disk to death.  These
"computer belches" have only recently come up, after months of use, and
nothing significant that I know of in the way of new hardware or
software. 

Just in the course of finding these newsgroups and posting this note it
has happened 4 or 5 times.  No user interface elements of netscape
respond at all during this time, and the wasted time is really beginning
to add up.

I presume this may have to do with free disk (151mb--considering it's
win95 that's probably not enough!) or main memory (32mb)--but why has
this just started recently?  I'd sure like to know exactly what it is
before I invest in new hardware resources.  Of course I'd really prefer
someone to point me to a magic preferences tweak that would put it back
to rights without more expense.  I believe I have enough cache enabled
(1mb main memory, 15mb disk).  What else?

Perhaps this has to do with another problem I've posted about before, 
without response:  When I upgraded from 3.x to 4.51, I put the new
installation elsewhere, but some essential data files (bookmarks, mail,
etc.?) were left in the old 3.1 location (Netscape: this was a _BAD
idea_).  Now I cant get rid of the old netscape installation because I
don't know exactly what files are still in use--I want everything in use
to be in the new installation directory, and to get rid of 3.x (...wait
for computer to burp again....) completely.  What do I have to move?

Any help appreciated.  Email replies greatly preferred.  Thanks.

Simply _clearing_ the visited links history (from within the preferences
menu) seemed to clear the problem--thanks for the suggestion Phil, KM.

I _did_ have history expiration set to an extra-special long time (999
days), which is how I wanted it, but apparently that can create problems
(are you listening, Netscape folks?)  The netscape.hst file was (and
still is) exactly 10,000kb long, but apparently simply clearing it
prevented some periodic maintenance chore from becoming lengthy.

Sounds to me like someone is desparate to get work, and is wanting plenty of free
advertising.

Mozilla is not the place for this - if his "friend" wants to contribute, then let
him/her come forth and help with the UI work! That way he can get the same
recognition as all the rest of the team.

This is from their Web site:

Now that I've read about Netscape making their code more open, 
they really ought to lift the restrictions on the CCK, the Customer
Customizable Kit that lets you tweak a lot of things about Netscape.

The biggest requirement of using the CCK essentially seems to be
not messing with their default search going to Netscape's site.
That, of course, is one of the things I would like do most!

The CCK already has all the forms in place and presumably works.
The only catch is that the license tells you not to change those
fields.

If Netscape is going to be open source with the intend of being
more customizable, it would make a lot of sense to immediately
lift the requirement for customizing user to not change the search 
method.

IF you can't give me an authoritative response, please EMAIL me if
you can with a suggestion on how to get a real person at Netscape 
that can could actually GIVE PERMISSION for me to type in my new 
intended URL to run the search for me.

If I can simply get a "YES" to customizing this in Netscape, and entering
in a new URL actually works, it means that I can immediately get to work 
setting up the our entire server based software to work with Netscape as
well having our website promoting such a product.

Thanks!!!

I've been obsessing with the evils of bundling ever since 
you-know-who po'ed the DOJ by bundling you-know-what with 
you-know-what version-number-you-know-when.

But the same applies to Navigator being bundled with the
messenger.

Now both Navigator and Messenger are my favorite products
in their class.  But here is a list of three major problem:

1. It tends to eat up more memory.  No matter how big computers
   tend to be, I'd always liked programs to be smaller, leaner
   and more reliable.  I'd open up literally 70 netscape windows
   (most minimized waiting to be read) if it were possible.

2. My choice of browser shouldn't dictate my choice of mailer
   of vice versa.  If I really like Navigator 5.0 I should be
   able to continue to use Messenger 4.5 if that happens to be
   my favorite mailer.  Likewise I might love Messenger 5.0 but
   prefer to use the leaner Navigator 4.5 as my browser that day.

3. Anticompetative. It's just not fair for a browser company
   to tie in a mailer because it puts mailer-only company at
   a disadvantage.  Smaller companies who might be able to make
   a still better mailer become more reluctant to try since they
   don't have anything to tie it to.   

   In the long run, there's less competition and less new ideas
   and everyone suffers.

4. It sets a really bad example.  (See #3 immediately above and
   extrapolate to you-know-who and you-know-what.)

Now, I know this is a Mozilla group, but I'm not going to apologies
for talking Netscape here because my point is a generalized pale
to not do this sort of thing.

If Mozilla is released with an mailer, please be sure that you the user
can easier run one with out the other one needing to load for sake of 
reasons 1 & 2.

And please don't ever release offical versions of them together in the same 
download file for the reasons of 3 & 4 above.

Thanks!

You'd think that after 13 builds someone would have enabled the proxy
server component.  It's becoming very difficult to recommend something that
can not be tested.  The fact that this has not been included yet is quite
simply, poor planning.   That is of course, unless you plan to leave all
enterprise business out of the loop.  Way to win the battle!

I've already done this.  I've tried both manual and automatic proxy
configuration.  Being someone who tests a lot of html, xml work, I have no
problems with the proxy configuration in Netscape 3.04, 4.04, 4.05, 4.08,
4.5, 4.6, and 4.7.  I also have no difficulty with proxy configuration in
IE4 and 5, or Opera.  My proxy configuration even works perfectly in my old
Lynx browser (I don't know if you been using the net long enough to be
familiar with Lynx.)  It is ONLY Mozilla 13 that is not recognizing either
manual or automatic proxy settings.

I appreciate your information, but your suggestions have been implemented
to no avail.  Proxy configurations should have been implemented in earlier
builds to give sufficient time for testing.  IE6 is going to make it to
market before Mozilla because of issues like this.  I really hate seeing
Netscape continuing to lose market share.

Proxy servers have been working since the M13 milestone
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22405>, over a month ago
now. the UI for specifying them has been working in nightly builds
<ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest/> since shortly after
that.

Those proxies which require authentication have been having a bit of
trouble in the past few days, because the feature which remembers the
authentication over a session has regressed
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24329>. But this should be
fixed in the next couple of days.

Open mouth, insert foot, sir.

Follow-ups set to n.p.m.netlib.

I think they're talking about including the address book in profile
migration.

Actually I think I have made a mistake, I'm pretty sure I'm looking for
the March release. I got confused whilst looking at another site (darn
31st's).
I anyone has a March 31 1998 build, it would make me a happy bunny.

I have found a site with this on at
http://mozilla.hypermart.net/
which has Oct 31 1998 and a Nov 15 1998
The Oct 31 is quite cool. The Nov 15 has a load of test progs and not a
lot of browser :). It was about Nov 98 when I first downloaded a
mozilla, and wondered why it looked nothing like netscape 4 :)

Hello,

Using Netscape 4.61, how do I send/receive ASCII file attachments
without displaying its content in the email message? IOW, I would like
to see an email message with ASCII attachments (not the content of the
files) that allows me to click on it as either "Save to disk" or "Open
file".

Thanks,

Devin

Yes,

We have the same problem with Netscape as well. Their is a know Resize bug
with navigator.  There is a workaround Javascript available at
www.javaworld.com but I am not sure where. It is in their tips and tricks
section, if you search on it.

J.M.

PS. Netscape seems to have all kinds of problems with resizing and frames,
and loading the wrong frames, etc...

The simplest way ?? Hardly...

Depending on your version of each program, you can "check" whether or
not either should see if it's the default browser. On IE 5, it's under
"Internet Options", then "Programs", down near the bottom of the page.
Uncheck this box. Look for a similar setting in Netscape (sorry, I'm
at work, with no Netscape (it won't get past the damned proxy server))
and "check" it.

Finally, this is a "MOZILLA" newsgroup, not a Netscape
Navigator/Communicator one. Plenty of people here know the exact
address for the *right* one. Then again, just use Communicator to read
newsgroups. See the "secnews" newsgroup ?? That's what you're looking
for ! ;-)

I understand your dilemna and yes, too often, people's reply is simply
"get a faster PC." But at the same time, what do Mozilla developers do
?? How far back, hardware-wise, do you build this application for ??
Same with other developers... Do they design it to run good on a 386
(of course, just think how that would run "modern" machines!) ??

Has anyone put together an HTML viewer component using Mozilla sources?
I would like to put together a Win32 app using an browser component,
but am looking for a component that can support a lot of the stuff in
IE/Netscape, such as Javascript. Any suggestions welcome. Please email
a copy of any replies also.

thanks,

No, Mozilla doesn't recognize document.layers or document.all.

In the lizard world, you use the DOM standards and CSS to do dynamic
stuff.

I'm doing all this to try to work around bug
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=75607> "Can't create
factories for several components in embedding case".  Please see the bug
for background.

It turns out that Factory creation somehow gets messed up when I link my
app with -lwidget_gtk on Unix.  My workaround is to remove -lwidget_gtk
from my link line and get the necessary symbol at runtime using
PR_LoadLibrary/PR_FindSymbol.  This works on Solaris, but not on linux.
For soe reason, the symbol I'm looking for, "handle_gdk_event", isn't
found on Linux, even though it shows properly in nm, and PR_LoadLibrary
returns ok.

[edburns@dsl199-33 components]$ nm libwidget_gtk.so | grep handle_gdk_event
00048b54 T handle_gdk_event__FP9_GdkEventPv
[edburns@dsl199-33 components]$ c++filt
handle_gdk_event__FP9_GdkEventPv
handle_gdk_event(_GdkEvent *, void *)

Can someone please help me with this?

Just FYI, before we had the Unconfirmed state --- and the primary bug 
screening work was for Browser-General bugs --- I wrote a tutorial to 
teach just that. It's at  
http://www.mozilla.org/quality/browser/prescreening.html

It was written specifically to teach net.community folks how to 
pre-screen browser-general bugs. If it would save time, anyone is 
welcome to borrow/adapt/steal any of the content as part of a "how to 
help analyze existing bug reports" page.

Basically, yes, the bug writing guidelines were meant for mid-level bug 
reporters, and to be as brief as possible. 

To ensure they remain useful for as many people as possible, I 
definitely wouldn't bloat the bug reports with special cases that only 
affect 1-2% of bug reports, but would be happy to link to any 3rd party 
tutorials, such as a "How to Help Analyze Existing Bug Reports".

(As noted, there's already a document to that effect, but specific for 
browser-general bugs. Now that we have confirmed/unconfirmed bugs, 
providing another low-learning curve opportunity for folks who'd like to 
get getting involved with Mozilla, and who could use a page explaining 
the ropes.)

Ik moet altijd overal met m'n tengels aanzitten. Ziehier het item uit
de FAQ:

Subject: 3.9. Feeding all articles on a server to another server

To feed all articles on an existing server to another one, regardless of
how they're stored on the server, first tell the new server to accept
articles regardless of how old they are (otherwise, INN will reject
articles older than artcutoff in inn.conf):

    ctlinnd param c 0

Then try these commands (a variation on commands posted by Katsuhiro
Kondou to inn-workers) on the old server:

    cd pathdb
    perl -ne '($a,$b,$_) = split "\t"; print if $_' history > pathoutgoing/list
    innxmit server list

where pathdb is the path to the directory containing the history file
(usually ~news/db), pathoutgoing is the path to the outgoing spool
directory (usually ~news/spool/outgoing), and server is the name of the
new news server to which you're feeding the articles.

When done, either restart INN on the new server or use another ctlinnd
param command to set the cutoff value back to what's specified in
inn.conf.

This may sound silly, but where do I get plugins for mozilla?  Do I go
to the developers site or mozillas?  Can I just use netscape comm.
plugins?  
Speficially I am looking for info on PDF and RealAudio plugins.
Thanks for any info,

I'd like to enthusiastically second Ramiro's proposal to allocate an intern to
Mozilla Plug-in API-related work. After Andrei finishes his PDT+ bugs, he'll be
creating a sample compilable Mozilla plug-in on Win32. On Mac, we already have the
source for the MRJ plug-in as a compilable example (should be compilable once
again after some fixes Patrick and Loki made in the last week).

Here are the concepts that an open source sample plug-in/plug-in SDK could help
developers master:
1) basic, compilable, sample plug-in (usable as development template) on each
platform [have Mac; will have Win32 shortly; would like Linux, Solaris, etc.]
2) calling a plug-in from JavaScript on Mozilla via XPConnect
3) providing a backward adapter file and Java .class file to enable the single
binary to work on older browsers such as Navigator 4 as well, including full
LiveConnect support (this enables plug-in developers to distribute a single binary
for all browsers, simplifying distribution)

On Linux, a sample compilable plug-in (with GTK library inclusions where needed)
would be particularly handy as the existing Navigator 4 plug-ins for Linux that
have Motif UIs need to be upgraded to the GTK UI, and proliferating GTK-ready
Mozilla plug-ins for Linux will help the vendors who are creating browsing
appliances based on Linux and Mozilla.

Once this new resource becomes available, the intern could also update the Mozilla
Plug-in API doc at http://www.mozilla.org/docs/plugin.html to point developers at
the samples where relevant.

Using the two sample plug-ins as a starting point, an intern (or anyone else with
a C background and the interest) could in a very short period of time (e.g. a
summer) provide a great service to plug-in developers and all the developers of
Mozilla-based browsers and devices. Feel free to contact me directly if needed for
more information.

Thanks for your interest in possibly pitching in on the project in this way!

- Have emailed Jonas the boilerplate text.
- Would *love* it if Jonas or somebody else would set these up as totally
server-side templates and maintain; we'd happily link to those templates,
wherever they might be, from developer.netscape.com and elsewhere so long as
the text remained something reasonable (and the site didn't turn into an adult
site or something ;-> ); I'm quite swamped and would be grateful for the help.

- Re: whether bug analyzers should explicitly indicate that a given bug needs
a simplified testcase: actually, the idea is that all bugs are assumed to need
a simplified test case unless someone explicitly indicates it's not needed;
the way to indicate that is to mark the donttest keyword in the keyword field
(and Christine or I need to update the bugathon page to get it moved over to
the new keyword system). If a bug needs special help of some kind, you can tag
with the helpwanted keyword.
- See http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi for info about tagging
with keywords

Answers to other Qs:

* How should a bug about feature that is not yet implemented in mozilla but
probably will (XSLT, DOM-events, CSS2) be treated?

You could assign to the right component (Style System for CSS2, DOM0 / DOM 1 /
DOM 2 for DOM, etc.) and mark it with severity enhancement.

* What should we do with a RFE?

mark it with severity enhancement

* Should bugs on top100 sites be treated in some special way (mark beta1/2
and top100) and what sites are considered top100?

You can mark these with the top100 keyword. Note that just because a top100
home page has a bug doesn't necessarily mean that the bug is a beta1 stopper.
But if you think it *might* be a beta1 stopper, feel free to tag it beta1 for
evaluation by the PDT team.

* Is it enough to see that there actually is a real bug on the page to mark
it NEW, or should we assign it to the proper component and leave it
UNCONFIRMED?

If you confirm that the problem is real and correctly described, definitely
move it from UNCONFIRMED to new, because that's useful information even if
you're not sure of the component.

Making your best guess at assigning it to the right component would be good
too.

> * How should a layer bugreport be treated?
See http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/bugathon.html#layerbugs

You send feedback to the webmaster, mark the bug INVALID, and put
[LAYER] in the whiteboard.  CC ekrock@netscape.com for good measure.

Actually, [LAYER] should go in the Summary (since it describes the nature of
the  bug) rather than Status (because it doesn't actually describe the current
state of the bug. Typo in my !@#$% directions *blush*. I'll try to fix that
tomorrow--sorry! Also, if you've tagged it in that way, you don't need to cc:
me as I can always go back and find these things if they've been tagged (from
now on I'll search for [LAYER] in either Summary or Status to be safe).

* a list of the official "top 100" sites

I could'a sworn that QA had posted this on the mozilla site, but I can't find
it. For now, I've pasted it inline below.

You've asked a set of great questions. It would be great if we could update
the bug writing guidelines or bug handling instructions somewhere to capture
this info. Maybe we need a "how to help analyze existing bug reports" page
distinct from the new bug writing guidelines? or just to add this info to the
bugathon page? Not sure. cc:ing elig for his thoughts.

You guys are great. I can't thank you enough for all your help!

Sure as heck should. Does in my experience. Please open a bug report if it
seems not to.

If you can reproduce the crash, please open a bug report on it and tag with
the crash keyword and move to NEW.

I think the problem here is that javascript: URLs aren't yet
implemented--or if they were just turned on, maybe there's a bug with them.
Please do a query with "javascript:" in the Summary and see if it's a DUP
of one of those; if not or you're not sure, please file a bug report with
your testcase.

BTW, probably irrelevant but javascript: needn't be capitalized.

Shouldn't be any.

Any issues here should be reported and should be resolved. This is a
critical backward compatibility issue if it's real.

doesn't appear to be.

In Navigator I could do this:

and I would get the image.

I know this is from RFC2397 and I don't think it ever made it into a

supporting this in Mozilla.

yes, i have tried it with several builds up to and including yesterday's
nightly.  If it is supposed to be in there I could file a bug.  Also did a
query in Bugzilla but didn't find anything regarding this problem.

Thanks for the response.  Any insight on the factors that cause it to
work/not work?

Hi.

I've tested M14 and the Copy function isn't available under Windows98. It
will be enabled in a near future?

i've been playing around with M14 quite a bit lately, and i'm glad to see
we're finally near something usable.  it crashes only a little more than my
copy of IE5.whatever

and i have a few wishes:

selectable features.  i liked the way version 2 and 3 browsers worked, but I
also like HTML 4, style sheets and everything else.  are there any plans to
create a bare bones mozilla, with just the navigator, no integrated mail,
news, editor, sidebar? also is some way to disable the pop up windows asking
if i want to save my password settings?  i just really want a simple peice
of software that will let me look at web pages.

i can see how all of the features of modern browsers are useful to some
people, and how mozilla + netscape will need them to compete and regain a
market share.

also and this is probably heresay, but if mozilla could support the IE
javascript object model, that would be very nice because a lot of pages are
allready written that require IE for DHTML.

Dear Collegues,

I have a problem: The application I am developing has to run on multiple
platforms. Especially on iMac browsers. Unfortunatly the application runs
fine, on my IBM-compatible PC browser IE 4.0 and I' happy when
I test it but when I tes it on my imac browsers Netscape Communicator 4.72.

Netscape gives me an error when pages have applets on it:
ERROR: Applet.com.sssw.rt.application.AgsGeneric can't start: error:
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:com/sssw/rt/application/AgsSubprogram

at java.lang.ClassLoader.defineClass(compiled code)
at netscape.applet.AppletClassLoader.findClass(compiled code)
at .....
....

I tried to set all the rights, preferences, accept java applets and Java
Scripts but i can't see what else to do.

Thank you in advance for your help.

Ferro.

I have to agree :( I am using a P200 with 80M RAM on slackware linux and
it is sitting on the border of not being used.

I look forward to performance increases :)

I am running slackware 7 kernel 2.2.13 on a P200 80M box. I just
downloaded mozilla for the first time yesterday. It is M14.

I love it! Kudos to you guys, this really is a great product.

It runs pretty slow on this machine, but from reading other threads, it
seems that is to be worked on soon. Good luck on this, we look forward
to it.

I only have one problem, and that is after making a directory called
mozilla in my home directory, and tar xf the tarball, mozilla will only
start up properly if i start up a terminal and manually cd
mozilla/package and then run ./mozilla . If i try to run it from ~/ (or
elsewhere) here is the result:

$ mozilla/package/mozilla
/run-mozilla.sh ./mozilla-bin
mozilla/package/mozilla: /run-mozilla.sh: No such file or directory

How can i solve this?  [spank the newbie...]

Keep up the fantastic work!

I have java off, java script on, cookies off.

by going to http://www.comcast.com , I was able to get mozilla to crash

I get the same, and I am behind no firewall and no proxy. 80% of the
time, it fails.

I am guessing this is due to network loads at the recieving end?

I didn't get any of those problems with netscape 4.72 or mozilla M14,
however I am running these on linux.

Give M14 a shot, who knows.

What irritates me the most is when people tell us to 'just get a new
computer'... Doesn't that make you angry? I don't know about you but
just whipping out us$800 - 4,000 and plopping it on a new system without
a second thought isn't possible for me.

Well, perhaps they will switch to a different rendering method for each
OS as time goes on. They know what they are doing, have faith.

I went to netscape 4.72 address book, exported the bookmark and then
imported that file in Mozilla M14. Works just fine for me.

Here is a sample code that works with IE and Netscape, with onUnload to trap
a window being closed by a user (even by clicking on the X).

For information, alert(), confirm() and prompt() don't work with Netscape,
in onUnload. But window.open(AbsoluteURL) works fine!

For some time I've been trying to reconcile a few facts. AOL owns Netscape,
the stewards of Mozilla. AOL claims that AOL-Mozilla integration is
forthcoming. Mozilla is a horrible in every aspect but rendering which is
just under par. Now consider the fact that AOL could devout unimaginable
resources to developing mozilla and they don't. One can only come to the
conclusion that AOL is going to spin off Netscape within the year.

Well, it was a failed (and ultimately murderous) revolution, but it did
inspire some great art, and Soviet artists in the 1920s had a lot of
influence over graphic design in the 20th century. 1920s political
posters in the constructivist style were background and inspiration for
the mozilla.org graphics, and I think they've worked really well as a
key element in an overall Mozilla "branding strategy". (Lord knows JWZ
would hate to hear me call it that :-).

This was mentioned a while back on n.p.m.ui, but I thought people might
be interested who missed it: The original mozilla.org graphics were done
by Shepard Fairey; you can see some of his other work at the URLs below:

http://www.obeygiant.com/posters/
http://www.blkmrkt.com/gallery/
http://www.seattleweekly.com/features/9933/features-parrish.shtml
http://www.citysearch.signonsandiego.com/E/E/SANCA/0000/50/55/cs1.html

(If we ever get tired of using Mozilla, perhaps we could have "Ming the
Merciless" be our new mascot. He might be especially useful during those
final days spent getting the tree ready for a milestone...)

For anyone who's interested in the original artistic influences behind
Fairey's mozilla.org designs, here are some sample Russian posters from
the 1920s, both nonpolitical and political:

http://www.moma.org/exhibitions/stenbergbrothers/stenbergbrosworks.html
http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/lirsk/bildseit/rodche.htm
http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/lirsk/bildseit/unbeka4.htm
http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/lirsk/bildseit/kulagin.htm
http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/lirsk/bildseit/stenbg2.htm
http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/lirsk/bildseit/lavin.htm

Whatever you might think of it in terms of ideology, certainly as art
it's much better than the Soviet realism crap that got produced later:

http://www.stanford.edu/~gfreidin/courses/147/propart/propart.htm

(Which reminds me, if you want to complain about communist imagery
please go complain about the stuff at the Hungry Programmer's site:

http://www.hungry.org/

There's nothing worse than the kitsch that passed for art in the
People's Republic of China.)

Also, if you object to Soviet or Chinese posters on political grounds,
here are some examples of "capitalist propaganda" posters being produced
in the U.S. during the same (1920s) timeframe:

http://www.hellerposters.com/1923.htm

(and other years). IMO these are decidedly artistically inferior to the
better Soviet 1920s posters.

However despite their lesser artistic quality, we could certainly
consider using these posters as the basis for a mozilla.org
"rebranding", as many of the messages of these posters are relevant to
the Mozilla project: "There's Only One Way to Become Manager" (1923),
"Don't Waste My Time (Idle Talk Earns Nothing)" (1924), "Jumpy? (Size It
Up -- and Keep Cool)" (1929), "Do You Explode? (Handle Your Temper with
Care)" (1929), and my very personal favorite, "Nobody Fixed It (Let's
Plug the Leaks!)":

http://www.hellerposters.com/1926.htm

And now that I'm finally back on topic, I think it's time to call a halt
to today's "art moment". Till later!

See bug 33427:

  http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=33427

Note that you can file bugs against mozilla.org to request changes in
Mozilla web site content; as you say, filing a bug is more effective
than just posting in the newsgroup :-)

Mozilla on Windows is actually pretty good now. But the linux situation is
another story entirely. It's sooo slow. It leaks memory. And it routinely
bombs after about 15 minutes of use. Why is that, and what are the plans to
do something about it? Is it the results of problems with gcc as I've seen
elsewhere?

At CERN (near Geneva), I had a California flag up over my desk.  People
would see the red star, the bear, the words "California Republic" and
think it was some communist or socialist thing.

Same as it always has, though it's on April 6th this year.

The way it works is, you show up at the Sound Factory in San Francisco
sometime at or after 8pm, you enjoy the music, buy drinks if you want,
wander around and talk to everyone you haven't physically seen in a year
(if ever), and finally stagger home in the wee hours of the morning.

Where? Where does it say this?
Here's the guidelines: http://www.gnksa.org/gnksa.txt
Show me where it says that signatures are limited to 64 characters. Quote it
to me. Please.

I'm sorry you hang out in a newsgroup populated by ignorant fanatics, but at
least you're among your own kind there.

Can anyone tell me why the a news group will have, lets say, 300
articles and when you download it there are only 25.  These are groups
that I view daily, so the chance of having expired articles is slim.

Please respond via email,  Thanks!

Hy !

How can I change from Mozilla 0.8.1 to a nightly or later to 0.9 without 
having to do my profile again? I know it´s in the Users50 directory but 
something gets messed up each time I try to change (sometimes major and 
sometimes minor glitches). It would be great if I could get some help.

Thanks !

Gorgeus

Hi:
   I'd very much like to benchmark how a page is loaded
by the netscape browser, at which point certain areas of
the page become visible to the user, in other words,
capturing the web browser status lines and the time at
which they appear as well as calls to whatever routine(s)
draw the web page on the screen.

   I can see delving into netscape code and doing this myself,
but is there a tool out there which already does this?
Because I'd also be interested in finding this information
out for (gasp) Internet Explorer, and there, of course, I
do not have access to the code.

Thanks,

George

	Well I know everyone else is excited at this but does
anyone else here besides me get a -225 Extraction error
while trying to install the PSM?

	I'm on a Windoze system, BTW.

	Well I don't know how to get more detailed info other than
when it attempts to install PSM I get a new window with a
page that says:

XPInstall Results
PSM: Error encountered -- -225

	My computer is a AMD K6-II 450 MHz with 96 megs RAM running
Windoze 98.

	That's all the info I can give right now, crypto doesn't
work for me :(

	I'll also add another minor problem:

Everyone is used to "Open in New Window" being the first
item on context menu, so for several days I've had blindly
been clicking on "Block Image from Loading" when I wanted
"Open New Window" and nearly filed a bug report reporting
that "Open New Window" was broken again before I realized.

	Then again, I could get used to this 8P

On a related point, as someone who has to trawl through enough terrible
bug reports every day already, can we please ensure that the Netscape
Beta doesn't send anyone anywhere near Bugzilla? 

And, for good measure, can we put a big Don't-Do-It on the front pages
of Bugzilla and mozilla.org pointing people at the correct support
channels? The Report Bug link in the mozilla.org sidebar will send a lot
of clueless people straight to the Bugzilla Helper if we aren't careful.
Not that that link's a bad thing - it's great. It's just that if people
keep telling us about bugs we'll never ship ;-))

Thanks for caring ;-) It's reassuring to know this has been thought
about.

Except it's me and Asa Dotzler who tend to deal with all the bugs which
start off "Unconfirmed" (at least in Browser-General)! Oh well, I
suppose someone has to do it.

The near future? M14 is the distant past. Try a nightly and see if you
still have the same problem. You probably want:

If, when you first run it, you run "mozilla -installer", it will import
all your NS 4.x settings (without damaging them in NS, of course).

Hardly surprising. Anyway, NetscapeSetup.exe is a 233k installer - and I
would be very surprised if NS hadn't shut down the back end as well.

The Linux tarball, on the other hand... ;-)

Are you on a Mac? A quick search of Bugzilla would have revealed a high
profile bug against its installer. But there are two other versions
which work.

Sorry: note the space. Install it, and then instead of running
mozilla.exe, run:
"mozilla.exe -installer", with -installer being a command line flag.

The Installer (capital I) runs "mozilla -installer" first time, but the
icon you run from is plain "mozilla". Or it should work like that...

http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=44071

The profile directory is currently called "Users50". It will soon become
"Profiles". The bug number is above. A message will be posted in
n.p.m.seamonkey when this change is made.

The patch will not affect old profiles - if you have profiles in a Users50
directory, these will continue to work (the profile paths are stored in
the registry.) Only new profiles will be created in the "Profiles"
directory.

If you have a "Nuke Profile" script (very useful for QA) you would be wise
to update it. Also, this means that if you have multiple Mozillas
installed, they may use different profile information.

(I don't want this to come across as a rant - I'm thoroughly impressed 
with the whole Mozilla project and the results look very promising.)

Since Mozilla 8.0.1 I've been picking up nightly builds every few days 
or so but I'm concerned that the Mail tool seems to be regressing in 
stability with every build I pick up. Now I know these are nightly 
builds and all the caveats that apply, but I'm wondering if anybody else 
appears to be seeing the same problems?

I'm thinking particularly about :

1) Mailing lists stopped working on ~Friday (they now don't get resolved 
to a list of addresses).
2) The folder pane and message subject pane started appearing split in 
the middle of the screen last week although it was possible to resize 
it. Now (starting today) there is no resizing handle so you cant resize 
the panes.
3) The 'sort direction' arrow from the top of the columns in the mail 
(subject/date/read...) window appears to have disappeared. (although all 
the functionality works)

  I have not raised any bugs yet (I think number 2 is in hand anyway) as 
I'd like to wait a couple of days to check weekend builds before I do so 
(both are very visible so I'm sure even simple testing would catch them).

Best regards,

Gordon

I have had the exact same experience.  I have been downloading the
Milestones since M8.  I have tried to break into the development side of
things, but there does not seem to be a good place to break in at.  If there
is, it is very hard to find such a place.  I think a better description of
what each CVS branch did with more detail would help.

I have also noticed the downward slide of nightly builds ever since M14.  I
have been downloading nightly builds since M10.  A week before M14, I was
blown away at how stable and fast Mozilla was getting.  M14 was just
horrible and not usable on Linux.  It has gotten steadily better since M14,
and last nights build was finally useable again.  Most of this was due to
the scroll bar not working.  I can not use a browser, I can not even test if
the main scroll bar does not work.

I would welcome any hints on how to break into the programming side of
Mozilla.  I have hacked many a project, but Mozilla seems to be over my head
for some reason.

Greg

I was getting the same error (actually it complains about 
not finding C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\GETCONFIGINI.IDI before the 
splash screen even comes up). I was running (as always) 
\mozilla\dist\win32_o.obj\bin\mozilla.exe. It is working 
now, after a cvs update a few days ago. The problem seems 
to come and go, have not found a pattern yet. I thought it 
was me, but looks like it may be a genuine bug.

On a similar note, I think this should be in the build page 
somewhere. When you build mozilla for the first time, it is 
not at all obvious where the executables are when you are 
done and ready to run it.

Hi!

Just like in the topic. I'am working on a project of "ThinClient" (database)
application in Java in a browser.
I think IE 5.0 supports Swing for ex. which is the part of Java 1.2
Will the NN 6.0 do the same or more (2.0 - dreams) ?

What's the "-13" in the build # mean ??

I know proxy authentication worked at one point, then stopped working, then
supposedly started working again. At work, where we use a proxy, I *cannot*
use Mozilla !! ;-(

Is it working now ?? Our proxy is MS Proxy...

Thanks !

Try exporting the Exchange addressbook to a more "standard" format, if
possible. Then, Communicator may have better luck "importing" it.

"BB",

There were numerous replies to your first posting. Did you not read them
?? They gave various reasons why *not* to use either Shockwave files
and/or animated gifs.

No offense to your friend, certainly... ;-)

It might be a different file system, but it can be done. Linux *can* read
Windows (either FAT16 or FAT32) file systems. Since Windows can't read
Linux's FS, you'll need to keep everything on your Windows drive.

I've seen people ask similar questions in regards to their bookmarks and
address book.

Hmmm, I tried them for a short while and at the time, I believe you had
to use Internet Explorer. Even Netscape Navigator/Communicator wasn't as
option. I *could* be wrong... and don't have time at the moment to check
their website.

I'd love to try some skins for mozilla.

Where are they?

How are they installed?

Also, I cannot seem to import my address book from Netscape 4.72 into
Mozilla, even though I am following the "import" screen in the program.

Who has some cheat sheets?

Interestingly, when I download and install the daily builders, using the
installer, the program picks up my profile from Netscape 4.72 just fine,
EXCEPT it does not pick up my existing address book nor does the command
for IMPORT work on the address book.

Is there a solution for this? Is there a secret handshake to get the
solution?

I saw that!

I see that PC Week is reporting that the beta of Netscape 6 will be
released 5 April. 

If Netscape 6 is an iteration of Mozilla 14, I predict the following:

A gazillion people will download the beta and give it a try. They'll be
so turned off by Mozilla's clunkiness, unslickness and ugly UI, they'll
dump it off their computer a half hour later and continue to use
Netscape 4.7 or decide the battle is over for sure now and migrate onto
IE or something else. 

End users really don't give a damn if an application is open
architecture, closed architecture, multi-platform or not. What they want
these days for an app like Netscape is something that works beautifully,
is fast, easy to use, NOT clunky and crash resistant. 

I downloaded a Mozilla build with installer on Tuesday. The puppy would
not install on my machine. I'm sure it was just a quirk of some sort and
that next week's Mozilla, even though it is a beta, will blow my socks
off.

And my hair will start to regrow.

I'm a Netscape FAN dammit...and I deserve better than Mozilla.

First, I didn't start this string, but merely commented on it. Thank

One can only hope the Netscape branded version of "6" is a lot different
than Mozilla. Thank you.

Don't be so patronizing. I've been messing "officially" in "beta" tests
of software since VisiCalc made its first appearance in the IBM PC
format. We all understand betas may have problems. Thank you.

Frankly, Chuck, I think it is too late to influence Mozilla in a useful
way. There have been any number of people who have voiced specific
legitimate complaints about the way Mozilla looks, feels, operates,
crashes, whatever. 

Hell, I just downloaded the nightly build, which I have been doing for a
long time, and...for the second time in a row, the *installer* bombed
out on me before completing its task. 

Frankly, Chuck, I'm beginning to feel that Mozilla is going to have
great appeal among developers of multi-platform open access software.
And the great unwashed, who will determine whether the program is a hit
or a miss...well, they'll give it a try. Unless it is slicker than bear
guts sliding off a doorknob, however, a try is about all it will get.

I'm sure you are right. So, then, we should just ignore what we see in
the Mozilla builds released to date, knowing that at some point in the
future, "it'll all be worth the wait."

Is there a target date for the end of the wait?

Well, I was involved in the betas for Win 3.1, Win 95, Win 98 and Win2k.
I remember getting about 24 floppies for Win 95 and having the install
bomb out on about the 17th...I've also been involved in betas with
WordPerfect and about a half dozen Symantec products and hardware and
software products from HP and others. I've been down the beta road
before. I understand bugs. It isn't so much the bugs in Mozilla that
distress me. I don't *expect* full functionality, after all. It's the
entire look and feel and operation of the program that distresses me.
Frankly, I cannot figure out the target audience for Mozilla. It's like
the developers are only talking to each other and have forgotten the
users altogether. 

What *I* was hoping for with Mozilla was something that built upon the
great features of Netscape 4.7, added some new stuff, added a lot more
stability and crash resistance and worked a little faster. I keep
playing with the nightly builds, when I can get them to run at all, and
what I am seeing is...well, I don't know what it is. 

It would be nice, too, if I could install this week's builds. The damned
installer version for the Win32 nightlies bomb out before the install is
completed. I suppose it is a bug of some sort, but I haven't had time to
do more than dump a previous nightly, download a new one and watch it
bomb out. Makes me wonder about the "Netscape" beta coming next week.

Okay. I'll stop complaining. I'll just sit back and let the developers
pooch what little remains of Netscape's loyal user base and then, like
everyone else, find a new web browser.

You're NOT paying attention. It ain't the bugs. I expect bugs. It
wouldn't be a beta without bugs. Perhaps you are saying I should file
bug reports to complain about missing features or features I don't like?
Well, perhaps I should have. It's a little late in the game for that.
But, to tell you the truth, I've seen the reception others have gotten
here when reporting "feature shortcomings" on bug reports and then
mentioning here what they have reported. It's not encouraging. 

Besides, as I stated, I can't even get this week's builds to install.
The installer now bombs out.

No, I'm using a plain old high speed Pentium III on an ASUS P2B-S

I've tried the version that accompanies Win2k. I find IE slow as
molasses loading pages. And I don't like Outlook or Outlook Express.

Which is why I was  soooooo hoping Mozilla/Netscape would be the answer.

I had a bug so bad once with an HP product I was asked to ship my
computer cross country. They hotswapped me another to use while they
plumbed the depths of mine. No luck. I later discovered the bug had to
do with a parallel port hardware loader that was bumping into a tape
backup program that first checked to see if anything compatible was
installed on a parallel port. Swatting bugs is fun.

Well, if Netscape 6 beta isn't a whole lot sexier than Mozilla 14, the

I'll try again tomorrow...and if it bombs out, I'll let you know. I

Because the level of expectations is very high. If Mozilla isn't a
killer app, offering end users really compelling reasons to jump from
Brand X browsers or to move up from 4.x, it isn't going to go anywhere.

No, Win2k. And solid as can be. 
Even Netscape can't bring it down.

Actually, I've found that 4.7x crashes less frequently under Win2k than
under Win 98. Dunno why. Yet.

I'll download the new Netscape beta when it is available, but if it is
mostly Mozilla, I'll be keeping 4.72 for a while yet.

I read in MozillaZine on February 13th, 2000:

> "If you haven't tried a nightly build in the past few days,

So, I downloaded the latest nighly build and yes! it worked. But
today, I've replaced this build by a new one (2000-03-01-16) and
it is not persistant anymore :-( I am asked for a passwd at each
page. It becomes even worst when using the proxy. The passwd is
prompt for each page AND image. Before installing 2000-03-01-16,
I had removed C:\winnt\moz* and everything in C:\Program Files\Mozilla.

Does anyone make it work fine ?

Config: PII 400Mhz / 256Mo / Win NT4SP4

Sorry to insist, but a Mozilla nightly build supported Persistant
proxy authentification and it doesn't any more in M14.

I am asked for a passwd for each image or text... Please tell me
if someone succeded with M14.
I can't use Mozilla as my default browser because of this.

Thanks

Yes, working here on 3/27 tho PSM failed on the first try. Delete the
folder and try it again. I could not get 3/28 build to work right, I
tried three times. Waiting for 3/29.

I'm using nb1b on W2K, and I'm seeing a consistent crash when I hit the top
"Support" button on www.microsoft.com with a build fetched on 2000/03/21.
(Oh, the irony...)

Can anyone else confirm this?

Have you made any attempt to report these bugs?  Or do you expect the Mozilla
developers to just magically know when and how it crashes on you?

Yes, but that can't entirely compensate for the infinite number of possible
configurations of machines out there, run by users of unguessable competence.
The one, true test is the real world, which is why letting the public at
alpha/beta software is such a good idea.  (Instead of letting the trial by
fire happen after the software has been released, as seems to be the norm 
for software companies nowadays...)

Wouldn't it's standard support be sufficient enough? I'll certainly be using 
Mozilla on Windows rather than IE. It's nice to write HTML/CSS and have it 
appear as you intended for a change.

Have you ever actually had a peek at some of the on-line big lists for IE5? It 
certainly doesn't sound like it as there are plenty of bugs in IE5's CSS 
support.

take it like this: the whole idea of _communism_ is not bad at all. but
people have been unable to imlpement it correcly i.e. they put the
society first and humans next.

mozilla is purely voluntary effort and I must admit that open source has
a lot in commmon with the _idea_ of USSR. Russia really made a really
perverse society out of it though.
but Mozilla looks fine to me so far :)

Hi.  I am trying to set up Netscape roaming profiles for a bunch of users. 
I'm trying to set it up to work with LDAP (because it seems to me that that
allows more admin control over preferences).  However, after exhausting
searches through the Netscape site, I came up with only one relevant
document: Understanding Directory-Based Preferences by Edwin Aoki - which did
not explain very much. Is there anyplace that I can find complete
documentation about how to manually set up an LDAP server to work with
Netscape roaming profiles???

  Thanks in advance,

I tried Columbine Bookmark Merge, but when I try and open

it only shows two bookmarks from the middle of the file
(and not even consecutive).

Is there some trick on getting it to work with ``mozilla bookmarks''?

I tried Columbine Bookmark Merge, but when I try and open
     ...\Netscape\Users50\jwb\bookmarks.html
it only shows two bookmarks from the middle of the file
(and not even consecutive).

Is there some trick on getting it to work with ``mozilla bookmarks''?

Thanks
Jim Ballantine

Which is the same thing that he pointed you at.

I assume you are referring to this:

| A widely accepted standard is the so-called McQuary limit: up to 4
| lines, each up to a maximum of 80 characters.

It is well established that this is a base-point, that is used to
decide whether or not the developers definition of "reasonable" is
compatible with the GNKSA's, and not a limit in itself (i.e. OE's
limiting the sig to 4096 character is indeed a "limit", but it isn't
anywhere near what the GNKSA is referring to, OTOH, a program that
warns if the sig is over 300 characters or 10 lines is near compatible,
despite not meeting the McQ standard).

A lot easier to go to <http://www.gnksa.org/>, but to each his own I

The GNKSA recommends a /warning/ for large sigs, and points the
developer towards the McQ limit as a common definition of "large", but
it doesn't require that the program use that as it's definition (it
doesn't really even /require/ that it issue a warning at all, a program
that refused to post unless you included a 20megbyte sig could,
theoretically, meet all of the requirements for receiving the GNKSA).

Probably a bunch of stinking vamps, hunt them down and stake them!

I doubt it, sounds like a regular bug to me.  The GNKSA requires the
ability to cross post, so if this was intended to satisfy the GNKSA
they got it exactly wrong (the ability to cross post is a MUST, a
warning when /excessively/ cross-posting, is a SHOULD).


|   3)  Provide cross-posting functionality
|
|       When creating either a new article or a followup, the user MUST
|       be allowed to specify multiple newsgroups, and the software MUST
|       cross-post (not multi-post) to them if more than one is
|       specified.
|
|       Posting software SHOULD prevent the user from excessive
|       cross-posting, or at least warn against it.  If posting to a
|       very large number of groups, the user SHOULD either be forced or
|       strongly suggested to set a "Followup-To" header.  Such a header
|       must be subjected to restrictions that are at least as strict as
|       those imposed on "Newsgroups: ".

So, like I said, sounds like a regular bug to me...

Not sure if right group - but here goes...

Running W2K (Final) under a normal user account (not admin).  When run as
admin no probs.  When run as normal user, I get several errors related to
file permission problems...

The first one I fixed...changed user group's permissions on
%SYSTEMROOT%/nsreg.dat to read/write, etc...  This let me get profiles built
for users.  Now when netscape starts, I get the following error:

Failed to update the system registry.
Please try using REGEDIT.

I click OK, and everything seems to work fine.  How do I get rid of this
message?  Do I need to change permissions on a registry hive and if so which
one?  Message is a little vauge.

Thanks in advance...

I just downloaded the latest build (3/28/00) of Mozilla, and it appears
that Socks proxy support is still broken (broken since M13).

In earlier builds, I simply had to add the settings in the "prefs.js"
file to add support.  I had been trying the same settings with M13 & M14
(copying the file from an earlier build, or copying from a working copy
of  NS 4.7).  However, in the latest build, it appears it doesn't even
create the prefs.js file.

I have not tested this under Windows on the latest builds, as my
standard test machine has a socksified winsock (I'll have to try it on
another machine).

Is this in the list of bugs to be addressed for the next build?  I
searched for it but didn't find anything.  We can't test our
applications against it if that doesn't work (at least *some* of the
java stuff works now for sample files inside the firewall).

Hi all, I was just reading the flyer for the mozilla party and suddenly
realised that every part of the mozilla party flyer is identical to
communist paraphenalia.

The things I noticed are:

1: Big red star
2: people wearing what looks like wokers cloth caps and hard hats
3: arms raised in victory
4: smoke (near the top) from factories maybe?

Is this accidental or is it intended as a stylistic approach to the mozilla
graphics?

Also, the main page mozilla logo has factories in it, which seems to tie in
:)

Jamie.

Umm, I just tried out m14, and, forgive me if I am wrong, but it appears
that you can only configure one smtp server for mail and news?  Has no one
working on mail and news ever received a "RELAYING NOT PERMITTED" error from
an SMTP server when they try sending an email from one address through a
different smtp server?  If you don't allow specifying individual SMTP
servers for each mail setting, you might as well not have multiple accounts.
What is the use if you can only get mail, and can't send any from a specific
address?

Jamie.

Hi,
	I use Internet Explorer with Netscape Proxy Server 3.5 on Unix. 
I have a problem with Internet Explorer toggling between a current version
and an older version of a webpage when you click on the "Refresh" button. 
I have tried disabling the caching of the web page, but that only helped
with Netscape browsers, but had no effect on the Internet Explorer
browsers.
 I have tested several different versions of Internet Explorer, and they
all behave the same way.  Also, I can go to any computer on the network,
and see the same older page, so I know it's not the local cache.  Any
suggestions to fix this problem or insight of how Internet Explorer uses
cache differently then Netscape, would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

Jason

Thanks for mentioning the UFAQ Stephen. You can also mention our 
Communicator Groups as well, as folks that are being redirected there 
from the n.p.m.* groups are getting immediate attention.

PSM has been working just fine in all the nightlies that I know of with 
the exception of maybe one shortly after the PSM release.

Working just fine here in 32210.

What I've been doing is downloading the installer version and simply 
copying over the /psm/ directory that I saved elsewhere into the 
/SeaMonkey/ directory and starting Mozilla. Works well ...

I haven't been using the ZIP install. I saved the /psm/ directory from a
previous install and just copy it over to the /Seamonkey/ directory
everytime I load a new build.

If your query is related to Mozilla development, fine. If otherwise then

No problem here in the Win32 builds. What I did was retain the /PSM/ 
directory from the first installation and simply copy it over each time 
I load the nightly. Works just fine ...

Curious ...

I run the installer with everyday's builds and I've never added the 
command line switch but it imports my profile every time anyway with a 
dialog selection box that pops up giving me the option to do or not.

In your particular case Harry, I'd definitely keep your 4.7x until the
final NS 6 or whatever it will named by then as you will expecting too
much from any beta of 6 ...

I certainly agree :)

And it works even faster under Windows 2000.

(3.5seconds to load default start page under win98se, compared to 2.9seconds
to load default start page under win2k-prof).

I'm certainly looking forward to the final release :)

It's good.  But I'd rather to put these messages in the status bar
instead of popups.  It should be warned if the pages contain LAYERs.

I tried every Mozilla milestones since M6 (or something like that).  I
know programming, wanna participate in the project, but feeling the
community is difficult to get into.  So I just file bugs in Bugzilla...

When M13 was released, I was amazed by its reliability and performance. 
Since that, I tried nearly every nightly builds after M13.  However, the
reliability and performance becoming worse and worse...  M14 was the
worst build I ever seen.  It shows no significant improvements over the
last release, just bugs, just slow downs.  

Post M14 builds are also very bad, keep going down.  My home page now no
longer be  rendered by the latest nightly builds, hit by two major
bugs.  I'm tired filing in Bugzilla, slow responses.  Perhaps developers
are shooting PDT+s, but also creating new blockers.

Hackers, please make sure your checkins are in good quality.  Check
bugzilla if you are creating side effects.  I wanna see the anniversal
build kicks.  Or I need to wait for Netscape 7?

This kind of browser detection code seems not working in the latest
build (031505).  DOM problem?  Any alternatives?

(http://compuwise.home.dhs.org/)

<script language="JavaScript" type="text/javascript">
<!--

var is_major = parseInt(navigator.appVersion);
var is_nav = ( navigator.appName == "Netscape" );

if (! ( is_major >= 4 && is_nav ))

   document.write("<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ie.css\"
type=\"text/css\">");
  }
else
  {
   document.write("<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"ns.css\"

  }

Hmm... I mean... I want to use different CSS file for NS and IE. 
"document.write" seems not working with the latest nightly builds.  It
made the whole page corrupted.  NS, IE and M13 works fine.

Yes, it seems to be threading problems.  I replaced the JavaScript code
with server-side CGI detection, the page now works fine.

What is the correct sequence of command line options to obtain a useful
output from patch? I have modified nsHTTPhandler.cpp and would like to
attach the modification to a bug in a meaningful way. Thanks.

Is _itoa() XP compatible? I would like to use it in a function I am
coding for use in nsHTTPhandler.cpp, but I need to know if it is XP
compatible first. I can't tell for sure from the MSDN docs.

If it is not compatible, is there an ANSI C equivalent?

If you don't know, _itoa() converts an integer to a null terminated
string and takes the form of _itoa(integer, string, radix).

OK. It may not matter if it is XP compatible or not depending on the
answer to the following question (forgive my questions I am very new to
C here).

If there was a function that only worked on Win32, but it was inside of
an #ifdef (XP_PC) would it matter? If it was inside of the #ifdef it
would not trip up compilers on other platforms since they would ignore
anything inside of that #ifdef right? Or am I not understanding how an
#ifdef works?

I do test with Mozilla now that quirks mode is starting to be a little
more sane. Remember that if you want your HTML to be rendered by Mozilla
according to strict HTML 4.0 specs, you need to indicate so at the top
with a doctype declaration for the strict HTML 4.0 DTD.

Not sure what Mozilla does, but Netscape sends the username as
"anonymous" and the password as "mozilla@".

You don't have to download any messages when you subscribe to a group.
Netscape asks you how many (as set in Edit -> Prefs -> Mail & Newsgroups
-> Newsgroup Servers).

Well it is better than the current situation of pop-up windows. I would
rather press "Cancel" a couple times than have a couple windows open and
have to close all of them.

That is extremely cool. Now where do we get to work on being able to
globally allow onClick, onmousedown, onmouseup, etc. window.open(), but
disallow onload, onmouseover, onblur, etc.? ;-)

You worry too much ;-) If you submit a bug, and think that it is a big
enough problem that it will be troublesome to many users that download
beta1, then put beta1 in the keywords field. The PDT team will look at

It happens with every window that I know of. Mozilla is currently a big

Kill FindFast and OSA and watch all your programs become more stable.
Please post future questions about Netscape Communicator in
snews://secnews.netscape.com/netscape.communicator. This group is for
the discussion of Netsape 6.0 (hey, JS says it's not Mozilla right? Try
navigator.userAgent).

When making or changing code in Mozilla, I have often wondered about one
thing. There are many many if{} else if{} structures throughout Mozilla.
In cases where a switch() could be used in place, would that not be
better performance wise? I know that switch() statements usually get
transformed into a branch table or comparison chain by compilers, but
what happens with if{} else if{}?

Another thing: should we look for inner loops that are not very tight.
That is, something like (taking liberally from the AMD developer docs): 

for(i ...){
  if(CONSTANT0 ){
    DoWork0(i );
}else {
    DoWork1(i );
  }
}

This inner loop could be made much tighter by avoiding repetitious
evaluation of a known if() by doing

if(CONSTANT0 ){
  for(i ...){
    DoWork0(i );
  }
}else {
  for(i ...){
    DoWork1(i );
  }
}

Do you think that there are performance gains to be had by looking for
such things? I am thinking especially in the logic used to parse mail
and news databases, etc.

I believe the build numbers are:

Because WindowsNT is *actually* a 32-bit operating system. Windows 95
and Windows 98 are really just a glorified and tweaked out DOSShell
(remember DOSSHell? When was that? DOS 5?).

Internet Explorer ignores the Last-Modified date on objects fed to it
via HTTP. It just caches everything. IE ignores lots of things that it
is not supposed to ignore. Content-Type is another one I can think of
off of the top of my head.

Damn, people are starting to find out that Mozilla is really a project
that was organized by Cuba and China to take over the United States.

Enough people have mentioned the similarity that I am going to have to
make the throbber in my skin a rotating hammer and sickle. I saw it
once, and I think it would be good for a laugh.

As a side note (and way off topic): The revolution failed, but so did
Betamax, Tuckers and DAT.

I always wonder how California gets labeled this way. This is the state
that produced Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, has Orange County (the most
conservative county in the nation), has had Republican governors for
like 16 of the last 18 years, passes "No bilingual education"
proposition, passes "No public benefits to illegal immigrants"
proposition, the birthplace of the taxpayer revolt (stingy rich people),
defeats almost every comprehensive environmental proposition ever put on
the ballot, etc. etc.

Yes! I do like the earthquakes. People in other states ask me how I can
live with the riots, fires, earthquakes, mudslides, floods and other
stuff in California. I always ask them how they can live without them.

Yeah, but how do little peons like myself find the people we want to
meet? Heh heh. I can just see myself walking around all night..."are you
Phil Peterson? NO? How 'bout you, are you Jud?"..etc. ;-)

I don't think so. The user agent lacks the Netscpe commercial
identifiers. Plus I have heard some of the developers say various things
in bug reports and in here that leads me to believe that Netscape will
not have the Mozilla skin.

You know, I used have a Roland D-70 (a keyboard) that I'm pretty sure
had a sound effect called "Mozilla". This was before I had heard of
Netscape, or the Internet for that matter, so I didn't connect the two.
But, on that keyboard Mozilla sounded rather like Godzilla :)

Most of the colors, etc. are set in CSS not in XUL. XUL only defines the
structure, not the appearance of that structure. But, if you reaaly want
to see stuff change, open up navigator.xul and remove anything named
<menu> or <menubar>.

Hell, IE can't even display an ordered list on the right side of a

I installed M14/Fullsoft yesterday and found that it would not properly
display a couple of sites of my own creation. I completely removed M14
and installed the build:

ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/2000-03-15-09-M15/

W3C says my pages are error-free (4.0 Transitional/loose). They also
display as intended in IE5.0 and all versions of NC I have tried (4.04,
4.61, 4.7, 4.72) 

The problems:
1. Alt text does not display on mouseover of images. It does display at
the start of image loads (true for both 2. and 3. below)

2. This is a page which uses <DIV> with absolute positioning and
Selection boxes:

http://members.cts.com/crash/j/jimclow/Pnos1024.htm

(Also Pnos1280.htm, Pnos800.htm and Pnos640.htm) These are the same
except each is designed for a specific range of monitor resolutions.)

(a) The text which identifies the Selection boxes is incorrectly aligned
(one line too low).
(b) The selection lists won't display nor will the action button (marked
'Show') work with the deault selection.

3. This is a frameset page:
http://members.cts.com/crash/j/jimclow/Passport/index.html

The page which is loaded when the image at the bottom of the left frame
is clicked has three Area Maps.

(a) The areas have ALT text which is not displayed on mouseover.
(b) The links are not selected when attempting to TAB through them.

Thanks for the information and references. I infer that the ALT versus
TITLE actions are HTML 4 specifications which cause the different
behaviour vis-a-vis current browsers.

Is the charter of Mozilla to conform exclusively to HTML 4 with no
consideration of transitional needs?

Not only isn't Mozilla done, is has some issues such as frames don't work
correctly, and the memory usage is insane in both Windows and Linux.
The rendering quality is better, but the browser situation in Linux isn't
very good.

Opera is very poor as of now.

That's what full-circle is right?  Magically sending crash info back to
Mozilla developers.
Besides, they eat their own Dogfood.  They know at least as well as normal
users do how good/bad Mozilla is.

Mozilla puts Netscape back in the ball-game at least, where I feel Netscape
isn't anymore.

Hello
Do the NPL or MozPL allow our company to port some portion of the source

code - the HTML engine - to our software which in turn  we use or
provide to our 3rd party developers for use in  the creation of apps for

sale?

If we modify the code and include it with our own is it only  the
modification and not the larger work which must be made public?

Can we compile the source code and ship it license free with our
software?

I disagree. Failure to load a .js file is an unusual edge case.
The more likely causes of JS errors are from JS code that won't
compile or run in mozilla. And the most likely cause of that is
(as you suggest) bad sniffing. I'd bet most problems will be in
pages that get served with 'document.all' or with references to
'layer'. These are exactly the cases where we'd like people to
know that the maintainers of the site they are looking at should
be urged to update for compatibility with mozilla. Otherwise
people are most likely to blame mozilla for not properly
rendering the site. We are trying to preempt a lot of misdirected
bug reports and avoid the general perception that mozilla is at
fault.

It is on its way. It is not going to make it into beta1.

It *should* be a console that does not popup at all. But, this
was an expedient fix that we just barely got in under the tight
beta1 checkin restrictions because we believe that *any*
reporting of JS errors is better than *no* reporting. It is easy
to say what ought to be. There are a lot of people working on
stuff far more important than this. A popup error message was
good enough for Nav 3 and it is good enough now. It does popup
more than one might want, and for various reasons. There are
still things to fix in mozilla and lots of pages in the world to
be fixed. Give it time.

I'd bet that you are seeing the same crash after the error dialog
as reported in http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30669
Which I discovered is really just another manifestation of
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30666

I'm not sure why you felt the need to turn your question into a
lecture on coding style. But that's fine. I did some digging and
I'll try to answer your questions...

Typing "about" in the location bar causes the current window to
show the 'about' page, period. Choosing "Help::About Mozilla"
from the main menu causes a new window to open showing the
'about' page. The access to the pref to decide how to do this new
window is at...
http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/source/xpfe/global/resources/content/globalOverlay.js#160

You might ask ben@netscape.com why he chose that name for the
pref. Perhaps it was not a value judgment but instead a statement
of fact give that the modal dialog does not actually display the
'about' text.

On to the JS error reporting...

The only reason to add an old style modal error reporter was that
it was better than nothing. After some haggling two important
points were made clear: 1) beta1 (on windows at least) supports
starting the browser with '-console' so people who want to see
the error info have a way to see it (along with other fun stuff)
in a DOS console window, and 2) popping up a dialog in the user's
face sends the message to the wrong people; all the viewers of
the page not just the authors. The decision to not force the JS
error dialog on all page viewers is an example of learning from
History.

You can enable the modal error dialog by adding the following to
your prefs.js:

  user_pref("javascript.error.alerts", true);

mccabe@netscape.com has promised to write some text for inclusion
in the release notes. He is also busily working on a *real* JS
console. I believe that part of the goal is to include an
unobtrusive but visible icon in the status bar to indicate when
JS errors occur. Clicking on the icon will show the error
console.

John.

Greetings,

I tried to post a message announcing the availability of Qt-Mozilla
earlier today, but it hasn't shown up in any of the
netscape.public.mozilla newsgroups yet.  I had cross posted it across
several groups and I am wondering if perhaps I ran into a filter of some
kind.  Is there a limit on the number of groups I can cross post to? 
Are there any other guidelines I should be aware of?  If so, can someone
point me in their general direction?

Regards,
	John Griggs

Greetings,
 
I am pleased to (finally) announce the availability of Qt-Mozilla.  This
port is now part of the regular Mozilla source tree, available from
www.mozilla.org.
 
The port is reasonably complete and functional (I will list known bugs
and defficiencies later), but has not been extensively tested, so please
feel free to download it, build it and try it out!!
 
Please feel free to post to netscape.public.mozilla.qt (which I monitor
daily) if you have questions or comments, but please report all bugs and
submit all patches and code enhancements through Bugzilla
(http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/).  You can assign Bugzilla reports related
to Qt-Mozilla to me, johng@corel.com.
 
Requirements:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Qt port of Mozilla has the same basic requirements as the Gtk port
(with the obvious exception of the Gtk/Glib libraries themselves) and
requires Qt 2.2.0 or better.  I have tested with Qt 2.2.0 only, myself. 
There is a test in Mozilla's configuration script (configure) to make
sure that the Qt version is 2.2.0 or greater.
 
Configuration:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To configure Mozilla to build the Qt port, use the following options to
configure:
 
--without-gtk
 
(This option is required to completely turn off Gtk support in the build
tree.)
 
--with-qt
 
--enable-toolkit=qt
 
(These two options turn on Qt support in the build tree.)
 
--disable-tests
 
(The Qt port does not include extra widgets (nsButton, etc.) that are
required by the test programs but are not used by Mozilla itself. 
Anyone interested in bringing these additional widget classes up to date
should use the code in nsScrollbar.cpp and nsScrollbar.h as a guideline
for writing the nsWidget and QWidget sub-classes required for each
additional widget type.  These classes must also be added back into the
Makefile and the component array in nsWidgetFactory.cpp.  Please submit
any patches back to me via Bugzilla.)
 
--with-qtdir=<path_to_qtdir>
 
(This option is required if the Qt headers and libraries are not in the
default search paths for your compiler and linker.  If you have the
QTDIR environment variable correctly configured, you can use:
--with-qtdir=$QTDIR, otherwise <path_to_qtdir> should point to the
parent directory for the lib and include directories where Qt resides on
your system.)

Known Bugs, Defficiencies and Things I haven't Looked At Yet:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
Widget:
-------
- Some CSS2 and CSS3 cursor shapes are not yet supported.
 
- I haven't looked into XIM support yet.  I know Qt provides support for
this extension, but I haven't looked at what would be required to expose
this in Mozilla.
 
- I have not looked into XRemote support yet and I am not sure whether
or not it makes any sense (or would be possible) under Qt.
 
- No Xinerama support.  It looks like Qt won't support this until v3.0,
anyway.
 
- No support for plugins yet.  This has to be developed for both
Netscape 4.x and Mozilla style plugins.
 
- No Splash screen.
 
- No support for Bi-Directional Keyboards.
 
GFX:
----
- No support for printing.
 
- No support for XPrint.  I haven't looked into whether this makes any
sense (or is possible) under Qt.
 
- Unicode font/charset support is incomplete.
 
- The GFX code should probably be reviewed for completeness and
performance.  It is some of the oldest code in the port.
 
Timers:
-------
- Timer priority is not supported.
 
General:
--------
- No sound support yet.
 
- I haven't looked into building Qt-Mozilla with Qt/Embedded or
Qt/Windows yet.  There is some small amount of X11-specific code in the
current source, but it is all for debugging or plugin support and could
easily be #ifdef'ed out for other platforms.  If anyone tries this out,
please submit patches for any changes to me via Bugzilla.
 
- There is a bug on some platforms that causes Qt to be incorrectly
initialized when Mozilla initially runs and registers all of it's
component libraries.  The symptom is that system colours are incorrect
(on my system, the background of text widgets goes black).  Restarting
Mozilla fixes this problem.

---------------------------------------------
 
I would like to take  this opportunity to thank the Gtk-Mozilla team
(Chris Blizzard and Ramiro Estrugo), Daniel "Leaf" Nunes, Brendan Eich,
Chris Seawood and everyone else at Mozilla.org for their help and
support and for putting up with all of my silly questions.  I would also
like to dedicate this release to Joey Ramone (who died April 15, 2001 of
lymphoma at age 49), Robert Fripp and King Crimson.  Their music made
the (seemingly) endless debugging bearable and was a constant
source of energy and inspiration...
 
Anyway, I hope you will take the time to try Qt-Mozilla out!!
 
Regards,
        John Griggs

You don't have to remove ZoneAlarm. See my comments on Bug 28403 for
instructions on using Mozilla with ZoneAlarm.

I am so damned sick of Netscape crashing on certain sites. I'm assuming it's
Java or ActiveX problems, but there are some sites where N 4.7, and now N
4.72, quickly freeze up.(newyork.citysearch.com is one common one, as is
foodtv.com) There's something on cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS that not only crashes
Netscape but actually blanks my screen, freezes my whole PC and requires a
reboot. Is there some patch or plugin that can stop this. When I use MSIE,
those sites are fine, but I prefer Netscape, damnit!! Will MI14 resolve 
thins???

At install time (Communicator 7) I set up the wrong parameters for my
News server. Now that I have added the right News server, how do I get
rid of the wrong one? Clicking on "Remove Newsgroup Server" and
confirming that yes, that is really what I want to do, only has a
temporary effect. A few moments later, back it comes.

Yes. See http://www.iol.ie/~locka/mozilla/mozilla.htm for the Adam Lock's 
Mozilla ActiveX Control Project. 

More discussion on this is done in netscape.public.mozilla.embedding
(a.k.a. mozilla-embedding@mozilla.org as a mailing list).

Yes, I believe so. Alexander Larsson has written code to embed gecko in a

No it isn't.  Netscape 4.x is such a miserable piece of excrement that it
would be very unusual to have high expectations for its sequel.  I certainly
didn't.

In fact, I am very pleased that it manages to pass the very low bar I have
set for it.  It has an acceptable level of HTML 4.0 compatibility.  All I
want from it, really.  Finally, IE and Mozilla display my site almost
completely the same.  In the future I can look forward to no
browser-detection hacks to get decent layouts and readability.  Finally.  It
has stolen some nice interface ideas from IE, so that's nice, too.

This is enough for me to love Mozilla (although my attitude toward Netscape
can still be fairly summed up as contemptful).  Maybe once the Mac version
comes together I can like it even more.  I would definitely evangelize
Mozilla on the Mac in this event, because Mac IE5 was just released and was
a major disappointment in terms of standards support.  On Windows there is
no real reason to go with Mozilla, and this would be true regardless how
much chrome crap the developers heaped on it.

You come off as a whiner.  I would suggest a long period of self-evaluation.

WinIE 5 does a good job, in terms of any formatting I've tried--in fact my
pages look identical in WinIE5 and WinMozilla, so maybe that tells you
something, Davey.  However, YMMV.

Yes, this works but it seems like this only redirects stdout to log.txt,
not stderr. Have a look at bug #29395 and prove me wrong if this is not
true.

Javascrip URL's do indeed work (in most cases, at least) but currently,
due to bug 22859, the character case in the URL is indeed relevant, ie
"javascript:" works but "JavaScript:" doesn't!

I am currently having one heckuva a hard time installing Mozilla on my
SuSE 6.3 system.

RPM's wont install because of the old libjpeg version, and upgrading to
the newest makes all sorts of things cranky.

And I am having trouble compiling CVS pulls... No idea why...

Does anyone have any suggestions?

Since I currently don't have the skills to contribute to the mozilla project
by coding I try to help out by going through unconfirmed bugs. However there
are many cases when I'm not sure how to treat a bug. Is there any guidelines
about when to confirm a bug? Is it enough just to look at the page and
confirm that there really exists a bug (I.e. the "bug" is not just a <layer>
problem, a special IE feature or just something that is not implemented in
mozilla).

Of course I always try to find out as much about the bug as possible before
taking any steps with the bug, but once I've narrowed it down it would be
nice to know what the RightThing (tm) thing to do is. Here are some problems
I've came across:

* How should a <layer> bugreport be treated?
* How should a bug about feature that is not yet implemented in mozilla but
probably will (XSLT, DOM-events, CSS2) be treated?
* What should we do with a RFE?
* If a simplified testcase is needed should this be marked in some way
(BugAThon?) ?
* Should bugs on top100 sites be treated in some special way (mark beta1/2
and top100) and what sites are considered top100?
* Is it enough to see that there actually is a real bug on the page to mark
it NEW, or should we assign it to the proper component and leave it
UNCONFIRMED?

For me it would be nice if we could confirm bugs as soon as we know that
there really is a real problem. That way it is easier to keep track of new
UNCONFIRMED bugs and give them proper treatment.

I think a good idea would be to put some of these general rules on a page
somewhere on the mozilla.org site and link to it from the
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/bug_status.html page.

I know Erik had a page which could be used to notify webmasters about this.
Unfortuanly I can't get the page working (My IE don't like the target beeing
a mailto: ) It would be nice if we could get such a page up and running that
is entierly serverside. I'd be glad to set up a page, but it would be nice
if I could get a pointer or two about what to put in the mail.

I have a vague memory of beta1 or beta2 should render top100 sites
'correctly', or is my mind playing tricks on me?

Why not use www.top100.com as a list? Unfortuanly that site is currenly
down. Does anybody know how long it has been down?

The problem is that many bugs are not layout related. Many (if not most) are
RFE's or bugs on features not implemented yet. How are we supposed to handle
these?

But we obviously need to get more people confirming bugs, the number of
UNCONFIRMED bugs increase quite rapidly. So we should providing more
detailed information on mozilla.org to help people getting started.

I've also experienced this problem quite a lot. It seems that bugzilla
sometimes miss by one, it shows all the properties of bug 30532 but the
database-hit (and the link) is for bug 30531. So it is only the description
that is wrong, you are actually sent to the correct bug.

We need some official statement for what is going to be included in mozilla
and what is not. I don't want to go down too hard on you guys since you are
doing an absolutely fabulous job with gecko. But it is just not good enough
to say "No CSS2 support is committed for final release". Does that mean that
you won't fix any CSS2 bugs? I know that is not the case since you have
fixed lots of them already and there are still many in bugzilla. And it
would be a terrible loss to just say that "we won't promise any CSS2 works,
use it at your own risk" since you have done so much CSS2 that is working
(almost) perfectly. So sooner or later you have to decide what to support
and what not. I can understand wanting to put of such a decision since
promising anything means risking promising too much or too little, but isn't
the

Don't get me wrong here, I'm not asking for more CSS2 features, I just want
to know which once we can count on working. Once we know that something is
supposed to work in mozilla we can start writing testcases and work towards
getting that working just as good as CSS1 will. As it seems now it doesn't
seem like you are too far away from having chapters 5, 6, 10, 14, 15 and 17
100% done (except bugs) as well as big parts of 8, 9, 11, 12 and 16.

Same goes for DOM2. Why not claim DOM2 events working? Aren't you already
there?

As for CSS3, it is not nearly getting finished in any area so it is actually
impossible to claim any conformance since there is nothing to conform to.

I'm not asking for more features here, that's entirely up to you guys that
are actually doing the stuff. But for me as a developer it is more valuable
to have 1 thing "working and bugtested" than 5 thing that "we'll leave in
there". Also If we know which parts of CSS2 to test then we are more likely
to find the bugs that exists there.

This could also be something to write about on a "how to help analyze
existing bug reports" page, what is considered beta1, beta2 and dogfood.
Just some general guides so that we get a general idea whan you expect to
work in those. (Hmm beta1 might be a bit late though ; )

A "how to help analyze existing bug reports" page would be great. Your
answers would be a great start for such a page. And I'm sure we can come up
with some more question : )

I'm in the process of making a tool for mailing webmasters about
mozilla/netscape incompatible pages. One of the errors is wrong parsing of
the UA string so I need tell them what the new UA strings will look like
(both in the http request and the navigator.userAgent and
navigator.appVersion props).

I know there has been some heavy discussions about how the UA should look
like for mozilla. Has there been anything decided? Are we going to keep with
how it looks now?

Also, has there been anything decided from Netscape what their UA strings
will look like. I guess it should be pretty nailed down by now due to the
beta.

I was also planning to refer people to the page
http://developer.netscape.com/docs/examples/javascript/browser_type.html
The page seems fine except that I thought that mozilla supports js1.5?

I'm using a 133 MHz Cyrix 6x86 (166+) cpu w/ 64MB and lots of other weak
components.  I have no problem running Mozilla, but don't use it as my standard
browser because I click on the netscape logo due to a bad habit.  The Mozilla
browser runs much more stable and faster then Netscape 4.6.  I don't know what
you're doing wrong, but you shouldn't be seeing slower performance in Mozilla then
Netscape on any platform.

A Pentium 75 with 24 megs of RAM shouldn't be running Win95 let alone multiple browser
windows!  Don't know how you've tweaked Netscape (disable cache, disable java...) but
you're certainly not getting a decent internet experience.  Try looking at something
along the lines of a K6-2 450 motherboard and processor (shouldn't set you out more
then $150, $100 if you get a low-end motherboard), or at least add another 32 megs of
RAM, that should only be about $25.  I know I plan on doing more then that soon, and
I'm running a system twice as fast as your's!  There's still no reason you should see
better performance in Netscape running the same websites (with the same features
enabled) as with Mozilla, but more RAM will definitely help you out.

Honestly, I've never had a crash on Milestone 14 while browsing standard
websites (ie, not websites designed to crash browsers).  I use it as a back-up
when Netscape starts driving me nuts.  I'm just too used to the look of
Netscape to give it up.  I've used it on about a dozen occasions, each for
about 2-3 hours at a time on all my normal website haunts.  Does just fine.  I
plan to make the Netscape Beta1 my regular browser, if it's easy enough to
migrate user info.  I'm not going to even try to predict what's wrong with
your computer, but it's not Mozilla's fault if your computer has ancient dll's
or bad memory.

The Irix binaries haven't worked in months.  Many many months. As near as
I can tell, theres something wacky in the assembler source in xptcall, wrt
to stubs etc.  At least as a first hurdle.  When  6.3 was part of the build
it was orange.  For over 6 months.

I don't have the tech-xpertise to fix it, or I would have.  Notscape ain't
fast enough on my tricked out O2.

> You running a proxy?  Firewall?  Is this for Mozilla or for 4.72?

I have the same problem. I use the Mozilla nightlies behind a wingate 2.1d
firewall/proxy. The talkback thing tries to connect through the proxy but
fails. If this is a widespread problem it could reduce the amount of user
feedback via talkback and thus decrease the quality of the product.

    I'm not so sure that this discussion group is the place, but I just
wanted to say that I am pleased with the latest builds of Mozilla. I
actually found myself using it as my browser for a reasonable length of time
tonight, rather than IE5. Hooray!

Well now, I'll admit that the old peepers ain't what they used to be,
but I ain't exactly ready for one of them Braille mice yet!  Sheesh,
check out this screenshot of the latest nightly.  And no, I didn't do
anything but install it.

PS: Save the 'don't post binaries' admonitions, it's 55K.

Hi everybody,



This a question regarding Mozillas COM control. Please excuse me if
this is not the proper place for this question, I am new to Mozilla.

What I am trying to do for my project is to have Mozilla as a COM
control embedded into a Windows application and when needed to get the
corresponding rendered HTML page as a bitmap  not just what is visible
on the screen, but the whole page as it exists (probably) in memory.

Can someone help me with an idea how to do this (or where to look)? So
far I didnt find any functionality to accomplish this.


Thank you an advance,
Simeon

I can verify this using Win-NT build 2000022608

It seems mozilla is rendering the PNG-images in mrtg the wrong way.
Cannot post an example since our mrtg-stats aren't public.

I just built a new computer and installed Netscape 4.76 on it.  The
Netscape 4.76 on my old computer has my preferences, bookmarks and
newsgroup subs and history.  Would someone be so kind as to explain how
I can transfer all that from the old computer to the new?  Thank you in
advance!

New computer is running Win98SE and the old is running Win98 upgrade
from Win95.

Greetings! 

My mother has a iMac with Netscape Communciator (latest version) on it.
Under "Preferences" it won't allow her to use the "Select Home Page"
buttons. They are not highlighted for some reason. Everything else
seems fine, though. Any ideas on how this function 
can be re-activated? 

Thanks, 


Ken

Before I go and add anything to this in bugzilla, I want to find out if
the work being done on this is more global than just the specific cases
mentioned involving prefs windows.  The same problem with losing focus
happens with javascript alert dialogs as well.

Yeah, so I've noticed.  Can't wait for all these little quirks to get
resolved...  It's still pretty cool, nonetheless.

document.getElementById('Layer1').style is the Mozilla equivalent.

Believe it or not, it also works in IE5.

Hello.

I was wondering if there's perhaps a way to use plugins with Mozilla.  For
instance, when music, video, a Java applet, or something is embedded into a
web page, the current milestone of Mozilla just shows a gray box.  How could
I, for example, associate audio and video with Real Player?

Hello.

I've noticed that the Netscape crash feedback component doesn't seem to work
correctly.  It begins to send the data, but the send is unsuccessful.  It
tries to send the data later, but that doesn't send either.  After a few
tries at regular intervals, the program stops responding and I have to close
it with the task manager.

I'm feeling that there's some serious problems here and it's not my fault.

It's in the "View" menu.  Make sure "Sidebar" is unchecked.

I was just kidding, of course.  I don't really think XUL is a conspiracy
(although, I'm not going to say it's not).  It's just that I personally have
had no luck making changes to the XUL files do anything.  Is there perhaps a
URL that shows an example of changing a XUL file to change some attribute of
the browser chrome?  I need a real example.  The example should tell me
which file to edit, what to change, what the changes do, how to make the
changes take effect, etc.- the works.

Thanks for your time.

Netscape 4.7, Win98

I have a problem when my mail inbox loads.  It goes through about a 42%
load of
the summary file, then I am given a fatal error message and the program
shuts down.

I assume that the summary file is corrupt.  Is there some way of fixing
it so that I can retrieve all of the information that is collected in
all of my subfolders etc.?

Thanks,
Ken Krone

I couldn't get this far with either Navigator or mozilla M13. Apparently
the site's database in offline.  I will still make a guess -- For better
or worse, if the site is using dynamic HTML, mozilla 5.0 will not
recognize either document.all (used by MSIE 4) or document.layers (used
by NN 4).  For help with that issue, see the following URL:

The flyer is recycled from last year (when mozilla.org experienced an
abrupt leadership change).  Its style suggests a cross between a video
tape box for Jurassic Park and a Chineese version of Socialist Realism
poster art.  Since the Red Guard would very likely have banished the
party's band (and probably many of the party goers) to a "re-education
camp", people would normally not take such tie-ins with the flyer art
seriously at all.

This thread has the appearance of being recycled, too.  I will point out
as I did last year that the "Lone Star" is also the symbol of the State
of Texas and of a beer brewed therein. .... And Texans often raise their
arms in victory, for better or worse.

Take a look at the Mac nightlies of M15.  You should see the Mozilla
browser using the MRJ and JavaScript being able to directly reference
the Java classes in the MRJ too.  Awesome.

exe after unzipping to my C:\Temp folder thinking it would install.  Then I
read directions and realized I should have downloaded the Win32 installer.
I then deleted the bin folder in the temp folder and then downloaded the
installer.  Now it won't run.  It gives a BSOD.

I then deleted and tried NS6.01 which I know is a version of Mozilla.  It
will install but when the splash screen pops up and then the Java console
loads and then freeze!

Any Ideas?

I have win98se, IE 5.5, on an Ahtlone 700 (classic slot) with 256 MB of ram
and an ATI All-in-wonder 128 Pro Video card with 32 MB of Ram.

OK.

I have wanted to have this for about 4 years now.  I think the technology is
finally starting to come around... thanks to Mozilla :)

Basically what I want is to be able to save a WHOLE web site structure into a
file and then have that file portable so that I can hand whole sets of
documentation and cool websites to friends or e-mail.  This also helps out with
application distribution as you can package all your XSLT, javascript, XHTML,
gifs, jpgs, Java, etc in one file and give that out to clients as one single
download.

In Neal Stevensons "Snow Crash" they talked about a "Hyper Card" which seemed
like a business card but actually had ~'huge stores of information' attached to
the card.  I thought that a HyperCard was a perfect name for this but now I
think it should be called a HTML Archive or Content Archive (car).  (WAR is
already used in Java circles as a Web Archive for the Servlet API).  HyperCard
is also a copyrighted name of Apple Computer and can't be used :(

Basically the jar: protocol in Mozilla solves this.  you should be able to
create a jar file and then enter a URL like:

jar:resource:///home/burton/test.har!/index.html

The only problem is that when I do this Mozilla just says:

> Document jar:resource:///home/burton/test.har!/index.html loaded successfully

But I don't get any HTML in the browser. ( I should see a Hello World message)

It might be possible to write a javascript and then use protozilla to come up
with a car:// URI which will be smart enough to display index.html from the
CAR.  

This isn't theoretical.  I need this for our Reptile project
(http://www.openprivacy.org/projects/reptile.shtml) because we depend heavily on
smart clients.  The goal is to hand over a reptile.car file to the client which
would contain java, xml, css and javascript so that the whole application can
function within a P2P environment *without* the server.

Anyway.  Just figured I would post here and see if anyone has any good
comments...

Actually several proposals of this nature are being discussed in the UI
newsgroup.  There are also several open bugs on this I noticed.  Time will
tell as to the solution.

But if you had a "remember this decition" option on the dialog box like the
new cookie boxes do, then even this is now a non-issue.

Actually, just go to the mozilla\dist\WIN32_O.OBJ\bin and run mozilla.exe.
(the path may be slightly different if you built a debug version.

The daily builds on the FTP site and the builds you compile yourself do not
have an installer (to my knowledge).

The Mozilla engineers usually put together their milestone builds into an
installer package available for download at their FTP site.  However, instead
of using thaty they prefere you run the Talkback enabled version because it
reports crashes back to the engineers for debuging.  I believe the installer
really just uncompresses the files to the Program Files\Netscape\SeaMonkey
directory and migrates your bookmarks and settings from Netscape 4.x.  It does
not have an uninstall yet.  I don't believe the application is registered with
the Windows Registry yet.  That will probably not come till Beta 2 or sometime
later even.  Not really sure what the plans are there.

Now that we are in the last few weeks of pre-beta 1 work, should us
non-coders that have the time go through the mozilla bugs and flag all
bugs that must be resolved in order for mozilla to be consider HTML
4.01, CSS 1, and DOM 1 compliant as BETA2 items?

I know tremendous effort has gone into making the new layout engine
standards compliant.  I don't think we want to hit beta 2 without
resolving any know issues that our primary competators, not to mention
the webstandards project and other standards advocates (like myself)
could toss at us to claim we did not quite make it.

I don't think we should focus on any CSS 2 issues unless that partial
support causes problems like in bug 14983.  I know that at least a year
ago the decision was not to fully support CSS 2 in the first release of
Mozilla due to the prioritizaion vs. resources.  I think we should
accept that decision in favor of shipping a product.  We can always add
full CSS2 support in Mozilla 6.  Now that the codebase is modular,
adding features should be quite a bit simpler.  I really can't wait for
the year when we get two major release of Netscape a year like we did a
few years ago:)

Anyhow, this is food for thought if nothing else.

I had the same problems on WinNT after an update to service pack 4.  After
some time I wiped my hard drives clean to fix a different problem.
Reinstalled NT with service pack 6a, with all the updates to Internet
Explorer and the other Microsoft garbage( "technical jargon"), THEN
installed Netscape 4.7.

Drastic actions for sure, but I have not had any problems since.

You can get the sidebar completely off the screen by unchecking an
option in the View menu.  I believe it's actually implemented as an
external Java applet, so disabling that option should remove all the
associated overhead.

I think the only other things in your list that can easily be
removed from the main browser right now are mail and news.  If
you're willing to get the source and compile it yourself, you just
need to put "--disable-mailnews" on the commandline to the configure
program before you run make.

OTOH, Unix builds come with the tiny demo-program "simplebrowser"
that takes what you're asking for to the extreme:  no menus,
toolbars, bookmarks, etc.--just a window with a widget at the top to
enter URLs.  It's actually far too bare-bones to be of much use, but
it's an interesting proof-of-concept.  (I haven't tried any version
since early in M-14, so they might have added some features).  I
believe gtk ports exist for Win32, so it might be possible to build
it there also.

>also is some way to disable the pop up windows asking

Go to Edit->Preferences->Advanced->Forms_and_Passwords, and uncheck
"Enable Password Manager".

Have you installed PSM?
(http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/psm/psm-mozilla/index.html)

It does work, at least with yesterday's build.

This might be the old lack of space in %TEMP% problem that Windows
InstallShield installers have trouble with. Dump everything in there
older than the last reboot, if no luck see http://www.ufaq.org/ section

In addition, posting this to auxiliary groups may actually have the
_opposite_ effect of what is intended - that is, it may clue in people
who didn't know of the Mozilla groups and result in even more off-topic
posts, even though it is written as a warning against just that.

Umm, why? The GUI isn't done, there are skins you won't see in that
beta, and the beta is just that - an early beta. Mozilla M14 has been
far better than 4.0 beta 1 ever was ...

Yes, but this is a purposefully feature-incomplete beta 1 we're talking
about, not a final release. Those arguments are valid against a final
release, but Mozilla isn't there yet.

In the previous incarnation of netlib, there was a "gzip" encoding
capability so that the browser could read gzipped html files, and
"decode" (un-gzip) them before building a stream to send to the HTML
parser.  I need to do something very similar, but with a different
encoding of the file.

I can't find this capability anywhere in the new "netwerk" code.  Could
someone please point me in the right direction?  Where would I insert a
"decoder" into the data flow after  reading the file and before passing
the data to the HTML parser. (Heck, I can't even find where the browser
actually *reads* a file!  Sure, there is PR_Open, but where does that
get called when you give a file URL?)  I've spent several fruitless
hours trying to mine through lxr.mozilla.org. And documentation? HAH!
I've sure tried to find some useful docs.  If I've missed anything,
someone please clue me in.

TIA,
-Kurt

I am assuming you are talking about Netscape 4, in which case you didn't read any of the previous messages - something you should always do before posting to a newsgroup. If you HAD done so you would have noticed that this newsgroup is for the development of Netscape 5, NOT support for Netscape 4.

In addition you asked for a reply via email. The motto for newsgroupd is "ask in newsgroup, reply in newsgroup".

Oh, and for help with your problem please visit the Netscape Unofficial FAQ at http://www.ufaq.org/ or

It should appear once per page. It needs to be repeated each time you visit the page or the developer may think they have fixed the problem when they haven't really.

Try http://www.mozilla.org/projects/seamonkey/release-notes/index.html and download M14.
It is a bit more than a screen shot :-)

To uninstall any version of Mozilla delete the directory you unzipped it too, including the Users50 directory (usually within the directory you unzipped to).

Then remove mozregistry.dat and mozver.dat from the windows directory. I think they are called .mozilla on unix, you should know where to find them.

If you grab on of the debug builds (where can you get these?) it comes with a DOS-style 'console' window saying what Seamonkey is doing. That may or may not be enough. There may also be a way to time-log what is happening (at the very least you can use Lotus Screencam or it's equivilents).

Any other ideas people?

Wrong. A well designed application will actually eat up _less_ memory if it is bundled. Take, say, messenger, as an example. For the preview panel it uses Navigator. That is already one thing which doesn't need to be loaded. Then there is the newsgroups, with many of the functions being shared the memory load is less.

You can. At least with Nav 4.5 and Outlook Express. When you click a mailto: link in navigator it will open up your default mail client, which for most people is messenger. You can't expect them to put Eudora on the quick launch bar though.

True, but, at least in the mail reader case, I believe the benefits out weight the disadvantages.

The same as above really.

You should neven need to appologise if you have valid points.

You can run navigator without the mail, but for the mail you need navigator to read HTML email and composer to write HTML email. The same would be true for any email client.

There will be a navigator-only version of Seamonkey, and I would expect Netscape too.

Could the text file be in the form

url[0] = "<INSERT URL HERE>";
url[1] = "<INSERT URL HERE>";

If so, then it would be quite easy to do something like this with JavaScript (which would work in any browser).
If not then I don't know how you would do it. I don't think JavaScript supports reading line-by-line, so I would imagine anything would have to be done in C++.

If you went to the news alt.racing.formula1 and asked what a light bulb was would you expect to get a response? What about if people kept asking questions like that?

The fact is this is a newsgroup about _Mozilla_, not Netscape 3, or indeed, lightbulbs. While it is a very simple question (and yours wasn't) it is totally unrelated to the newsgroup. It is not abnormal to get fedup answering questions unrelated to what we are here for, so most people don't. Many people here use IE as their browser anyway, so you wouldn't expect them to know.

No, I'm sure that some builds are still compiled with the console window in them. Not from that URL though, that is the normal builds. Maybe the also contain the benchmarking code.

What about disk space. I know at least WinZip needs enough space in C:\windows\temp to do all the work, which is then copied over to the correct location. Could this be the problem?

I have a differant problem with 4.7. The Netscape crashes, the talkback thing loads then crashes straight away. No idea why, I think it did that over a windows reinstall too.

I tried doing this when I was working on my IE skin ( http://www.lemnet.com/ieskin ) but it creates some problems.

Either you move the current grippy up to the top of the seperator bar and make it (and the whole seperator bar wider), or you move it into the sidebar header, in which case it doesn't hide properly. All the grippies are 'inteligent' as to what they hide, they just don't always get it right.

Fidn a bug in bugzilla that you feel you are capable of, post a message to the bug and do a bit of digging in the source. When you find the problem post a patch to that bug and hopefully it should get included.

Remember just testing build and reporting bugs is still very important.

I think all XUL (and any code coming from Mozilla) is automatically under the NPL, you should probably check that for full details.

So? When people install an aqua skin they are trying to emulate the Mac. Every time they (or someone else) uses their computer they are reminded about Apple. In that way it has a positive effect for the company.

Personally I think the whole Aqua case was just to get a bit more publicity for Apple.

Yes.

I think nokia or someone are going to be using Mozilla in a set-top box, under some form of linux. There was another company that was writing its interface in XUL.

I agree. We use netscape 4.7 here at uni, and as soon as it hits a page
with Java, it crashes. Javascript doesn't seem to be so much of a
problem though

If I start Mozilla in a xterm in the background i can see the messages
I get message that says..

Error Loading https:\\(URL) 8007000e

I installed the latest build i think.  Build ID 2000122717 and istalled
 PSM as root user but it wont let me get into sites that require SSL. 
 Any help would be much appreciated.  

I can go to SSL sites with Netscape but I like the feel of Mozilla 
much better.


Thank you in advance

I saw the message below in deja.com, but my ISP's news
server doesn't have alt.netscape, so I have to reply here.

Netscape V4.7 ate my bookmark file this early morning,
just as happened to the person below. Does Netscape
keep a backup copy somewhere? (Oh Please!) (I know,
I should have been doing that myself...)

(Has this product been going steadily downhill? Was
AOL buying Netscape a favor to Microsoft?)

I answered my own quesion. There was a .TMP file in my
\windows\temp subdirectory that was a day-old version
of my bookmark file! Thank goodness! (I found it by 
searching for text I knew was in the bookmark file.)

PS: I sure hope this new Netscape version (6?) will go
back to being the better browser. V4.7 actually has me
thinking it's time to go to IE, which I've never liked.
In 4.7, for every improvement there's at least one 
devolutionary change...disappointing in the extreme.

There could be a way for his friend to make something...

Instead of using it as the spash screen, it could be used for the Help->About
screen.

That way all [ok, maybe most] of the required components would already be
loaded.

Just a thought.

It still uses the same rendering engine.  And the fact that it's even
remotely responsive when it's asked to render the entire UI is a
testament to just how much Gecko kicks ass.

Really, there is no "old rendering".  Viewer.exe is close to what you
mean, but from the beginning of the rewrite of Mozilla (the decision
that led to the scrapping of MozClassic) Gecko has been pegged to render
the thing.  If that decision hadn't been made, Netscape would not be
supporting Mac or Linux itself, and it's almost certain neither platform
would be getting any reasonable amount of attention.  Besides, native
interfaces are so 1990's. :)

Nah.  That's Jazilla.  100% platform agnostic. :)  (And yes, as a helper

It's highly unlikely that XUL would be used in a cell-phone scenario. 
Most likely, a cell phone would use an UI something like viewer.exe;
quick and minimalist.

And, of course, optimization is the last piece in any puzzle.  Once all
the features are in, then you can optimize for every little piece of
speed you need. :)

The processor time is not the significant issue.

The issue is that the DLL that handles Shockwave is loaded last of all
components, as a plugin.  The splash screen wouldn't even appear until
AFTER everything already loaded.

Same deal for GIFs, but it would be somewhere in the middle of the
loading.

Only .bmp loading (which comes from the OS) is available right away at
the beginning of the load time.

If they made it compatible with ANY version of Java, it would be more

There's actually an experimental plugin for using MRJ in Communicator
4.x somewhere on mozilla.org.  The Mac weenies at Netscape want the MRJ
to work in Mozilla. :)

Even if if is desirable for the HTML email to be displayed is the standard

There are 2 setup.exe files, they both give errors:

The setup.exe gives:

Well, I can't tell you how, but take a look at the Composer JavaScript
in one of the builds.
Enter some text and make it bold or something.  Select that text and go
to the insert menu.  If you say insert HTML a dialog will come up with
the currently selected html in text form.

> In general, is there a reference for Mozilla JavaScript

I've only found 2 places to look for Javascript unfortunatly.  One of
them is the w3c.org which is really hard to read.  A cool site (Although
not complete yet) is http://dhtmlfiend.cjb.net/ (Make sure to view it in
mozilla... it looks better)  That lists off the DOM (The commands like
document.getElementById used in Javascript) and it even has some normal
text descriptions.

Not any more.  That was disabled a couple of weeks ago.  You need to
actually compile the code with the consol turned on in order to do that.

> Any other ideas people?
Well, there is already benchmarking code which the people writing
Mozilla use.  It slows down the browser a lot when its enabled... so you
need to compile the code with that turned on in order to see the
results.

There are also benchmarking products out there.  Take a look around, I'm
sure you'll be able to find one (Not sure if it would be free though).  
I believe Rational Visual Test (For visual studio) can record macro's
and then return the time it took but I'm not 100% sure.  That software
runs on the final executable as well so you would be able to benchmark
both browsers.

With mozilla I've had 33 open before it crashed.  If you rappidly press
ctrl-n it crashes after about 6.
Well, I just hit 26 Mozilla windows with Nav4 Messenger open plus the
toolbar programs and I ran out of ram :(  I was going to take a
screenshot but there isn't enough ram to (Only have 128)  The start bar
won't popup so I can't check how much memory its using.  The open
windows popup looks cool.  It has all of the windows listed (Same with
the tasks menu) :)

BTW I have a lot of the windows open to mozilla.org but in some of them
I'm browsing... so I can use it.  Images just stopped displaying and the
toolbar buttons now have gray areas where they should be transparent but
that is to be expected when you don't have any ram left :)

I think this might be a good example of how to make the UI better.  This
user was unable to find the view->sidebar option, maybe it should also
be available in the right click menu.  I know on the start bar in
windows (With IE4+ installed) if you right click it allows you to
disable/enable different toolbars similar to what this user was trying.

Maybe we should add a similar option.

A few things.  One of the ones that stumped me was the way Mozilla
handles float vs the way IE handles it.  Mozilla thinks that float is
floating on top of everything, so relative divs go underneath it and the
text flows around the edges.

IE thinks that float is just like relative.  So a relative div gets
placed beside it.

For my page, I wound up having to create a browser sniffer and attaching
different style sheets to the page because the left in Mozilla was not
the same as the left in IE.

Mozilla          Same code - IE
1 Float layer
1 Relative layer

I don't think it does anything at the moment.  Its a string needed (not
100% sure) for xml but moz. doesn't use it.  If you pronounce XUL as
zool then it becomes a line from Ghostbusters the movie.

I seem to remember a virus on disk 2 which stopped my floppy version
from working.  The virus didn't mix well with the 1.6Mb format of the
disks and neither program (Win95 Beta and the virus) operated
correctly.  :|

IMHO its a little too early code wise, for the netscape beta to be
coming out, but I can see why they are doing it.  The people at my work
ask me every day, "Is it out yet?"  "Can we use it yet?"  "We want that
activeX control, you'll be sure to remind us when its going, right?" 
ARGH.  Every day I download the nightly zip and hope to see npmozctl.dll
again.  hehe

Also, they keep telling me "No ones going to switch, its been too
long".  They don't consider 4-4.7 an upgrade at all.  They want a new
Major number.  Looks like Netscape will be giving them an increase of 2
:)

I don't really understand why they are always antsy though.  Its only
really been in development a year more than most programs.  Take unreal
for example... how many years were they programming that beast?  People
still tried it out after all that time.  I must say I trashed it after
seeing it chug when I pressed fire, but I tried it though... I fear
users doing the same with Netscape.  They will try it, and then say, but
it doesn't have option X and trash it.

If the install bombs out on you, file a bug and download the zip file. 
The zips work almost every day (Today's is flaky though.  Crashed after
clicking on a few buttons - which didn't depress)

It isn't the size of the monitor which matters.  Its the resolution.  I
operate at 1600x1200 on my 21" at home, and I operate at 1600x1200 on
the 16" (I think thats the size... could be wrong) at work.  The
monitors are different sizes, but the amount of information displayed is
the exact same on both.

Are you running at 640x480?  800x600?  1024x768?  1152x864?

There are no java applets being used in Mozilla at the moment.  The side
bar is all RDF and JavaScript code.  Most of the panels in the side bar
are remote sites, so the only place they take up space is in the cache.

Best way to get a reaction/decision to that is to file a bug report on
bugzilla.mozilla.org as a missing dom level 0 feature.
I think backwards compatibility is important though javascript entities
never gained much importance as IE/MS ignored them and thus you can't
apply them on cross browser pages.

On my WIN98 NS4.7 there is edit/preferences/appearance/colors which by
default sets the background to gray but also has a "windows colors"
checkbox.

I have a problem, too. Mine is that I have "unvisited links" set to light
blue on bot my desktop and my laptop. I do not have "Always use my
colors..." checked on either machine. When I go to anywho.com, the side
panel has a dark blue background. The links appear white and legible on my
laptop, but blue and illegible on my desktop.

Same trouble @ work on Sol. 2.7 & Navi 4.72.

I bet I've forgotten something.

Thanks for the attn.

I'll take a stab at fixing the Find and Find Again accelerators, if
someone will tell me what files I need to look in; I've tried looking
through the source tree myself, and got completely lost.  Is there
anyone in particular I should mail?

Does Mozilla seem to be really slow with bookmarks?  Has your 
bookmarks file mysteriously become huge and bloated?  The following 
Perl script might help; I used it to shrink my bookmarks file from 
17,000 lines to 700 lines.  Backup your bookmarks file before trying 
this; command line usage is "script.pl infile outfile".

Is there any way for me, the user, to specify my own keybindings for

the user's profile chrome directory, but I have no idea of how to do

Does anyone have any speculation on when Mozilla will become Navigator 5,
available to the public?  Netscape 4's very poor CSS support is causing me a
ton of headaches.  Specifically in referencing .css files.  If I have a
division with ID="LAYER_MAIN" and a .css file with

#LAYER_MAIN
{
    background-color: #000000;
}

It doesn't change the background color to black.  In fact, anything that's
referencing through the div tag doesn't work at all.

Anyone have any suggestions?

Matt

The sidebar sucks, how do I get rid of it?  I can't find any options in
preferences and right clicking does nothing.  I know I can resize it to move
to the side of the screen, but all I want is a straight forward browser
window.

What's been giving you problems with IE?  The only thing I've noticed is how
objects will inherit the properties.

I agree.  I RARELY use the View menu in any program.  Either I right click
to see the source, or hit some of the shortcut keys.  The Preferences area
let's the user customize some of the views, but not all; such as that stupid
bar.

Good CSS support, but a terrible interface.  It makes me feel like the
program can crash at any time.

I'm working on a web page design and in order to keep it static, I'm using a
table with table-layout: fixed.

So I designed the table and the images to make everything look smooth.  In
IE and Netscape, the table looks fine, but in Mozilla, some things like
valign=bottom don't work and it's giving some cells my <body> background
color.  Here's my table code:

<table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 style="table-layout: fixed;"
width=700 bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<tr><td width=10 bgcolor="black">&nbsp;</td><td width=200
bgcolor="black">&nbsp;</td><td width=10 bgcolor="black">&nbsp;</td><td
width=10 bgcolor="black">&nbsp;</td><td width=460
bgcolor="black">&nbsp;</td><td width=10 bgcolor="black">&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan=3 rowspan=3 bgcolor="black">&nbsp;</td><td colspan=3
bgcolor="#000000">&nbsp;</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=top align=left><img src="images/corner_1.jpg" height="10"
width="10"></td><td rowspan=2>&nbsp;</td><td valign=top align=right><img
src="images/corner_4.jpg" height="10" width="10"></td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr>

<tr><td colspan=2 bgcolor="black">&nbsp;</td><td valign=bottom align=left

Proxy servers have been working since the M13 milestone
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22405>, over a month ago
now. the UI for specifying them has been working in nightly builds
<ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/nightly/latest/> since shortly after that.

Those proxies which require authentication have been having a bit of
trouble in the past few days, because the feature which remembers the
authentication over a session has regressed
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=24329>. But this should be
fixed in the next couple of days.

Open mouth, insert foot, sir.

Unfortunately not. You can search Bugzilla
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/> for what you're interested in, but it's
rather difficult to do effective searches without learning quite a bit
about how Bugzilla keeps track of bugs. (Unimplemented features, and
suggestions for improvement, count as `bugs' in Bugzilla.)

Yes and no.  There is a feature for site-by-site cookies and
Javascript.  The cookie one has a front-end and the Javascript one does
not yet.  I believe they have been written independently and as such
don't share much functionality, which will be a problem eventually.

See http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7380 for the blue sky.

Why not base it on the number of voters instead of the number of votes? 
As a matter of fact, why not allow both metrics as Bugzilla columns?

what is the latest version of Mosaic?
I last used it at 3.0, which was about as good as Netscape or IE 2.0

don't know why that is, but I thought I should post this observation.

I have a table in which there is an image. I have set the table attributes
to stretch the image to fit the table cell. The table cell itself stretches
to match the size of the browser window.

All pretty standard stuff.

However, in Netscape, when viewing the table, if Netscape has to strech the
graphic, it doesn't show the graphic, but a stretched box instead with the
customary image symbol and my alternative text.

I can 'show' the image in another netscape window from here with a righ
click etc etc, but the image will only appear on the original page once I
have reduced the size of the window so that the image does not have to be
stretched. Strange.

Naturally, this effect works perfectly in IE.

How can I get Netscape to work as I want?

Example code follows:

<table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
        <td align="center" width="100%"
        background="images2/toplarge.gif"><table border="0"
        cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
            <tr>
                <td nowrap><img src="images2/pushleft.gif"
                alt="What all the fuss was about!" width="65%"
                height="150"><img src="images2/pushmusic.gif"
                alt="The music of course!" width="35%"
                height="150"></td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        </td>
        <td valign="top" width="60"><img
        src="images2/toprightlarge.gif" width="60" height="150"></td>
    </tr>
</table>

He must either 1) be an extraordinarily patient man or 2) have nothing
better to do. I didn't even know the performance of Mozilla was
*supposed* to be acceptable at this stage of its development until I
read this thread. I'm on a Celeron 433 with 96MB of RAM and the speed
of the current build is way, way far from acceptable. Not even in
sight of the speed of the current Netscape. Even with debug disabled.

I tested Moz out on a c366/64MB RAM running Win98, and it feels so sluggish
compared to my c400/64MB RAM/NT4 :(

This is the wrong Newsgroup for your problem. Perhaps one of the following

netscape.communicator.mac
netscape.macintosh

There apperas no error message or something during sending the mail with

Now I use the lates nightly-built version and the problem isn't away.

What shall I do?

Everyone, 

Time for a little celebratory cheer...Moz on Win32 is F-A-S-T. That in my
book makes it quite usable, that and the countless patches and long hard
work put in by the code-fiends. Good job! It's really starting to feel
like a beta, and man, that has the juices flowing here. 

Anyhow, I'm also working on a web site, and one of the browsers I've been
using has been Moz. Since it's a more strict about standards, it makes a
great testing tool, as well.

Any other designers out there testing their stuff with Moz?

It would, if I was on NT. :) I'm using Win98, and the nightly build I got
simply kills. It takes longer to load the prog than NN4.7, but it  renders
them faster. I can't compare it to IE 5, but I'd say it's a trifle faster
than IE 4.01. I'm sure this won't be true for every single page out there,
but from what I'v eseen so far, I'm impressed. 

My system is 400 Mhz K6-2, 128 Mb RAM, nothing spectacular in the video
department. Maybe it's the RAM?

Don't you think about:mozilla should maybe showcase as many features as
possible?

Maybe that's a bad idea

but - about:mozilla is a fairly simple page, what about an about:demo or
:features? Think advertising - for a 'storefront' - show off all your coolness
here for the few who want to see it. (This way you're not inundating the use
with stuff for about: and about:mozilla keeps it's classic verse & rhyme, but
you can also see what's new in living color (with Alpha! :)

Just a-musing.

I'm extremely happy with mozilla!

I'm finding that it's loading in about 6 seconds and displaying moz.org about 2s
after that! (Athlon500, Nortel 1 Meg Modem)

Now, if only i could have it on my Palm Vx........ (go n.p.m.smalldevices!!!!)

Netscape -
8s to load full win
buffy.com (yes this is my brother's machine -I've got the k7 :) is a good 16
seconds later (and since it's his startup - I'm assuming most of it's cached.).

My Machine: k7/500, 128 SD, UDMA66: (and I'm running seti@home full time)
Mozilla
.5s to splash
5.5s to full window
<1s to moz.org (not cached)
3s for buffy.com (not cached)

timed with a stop watch, not accurate....

Layout time is amazing, but load time still hurts on old machines....

(Side note: after I put mozilla on his machine, he was an instant convert!)

What would be nice is a "stay on top" mode for the JS console because that way with maximized
windows (and leaving DualHead on my G400 off) you can see the errors in (near)realtime.

to achieve .. you do not need it loaded ... its just one of those things

Thanks Stephen

Unless OSA is "Office Start Up", it is not in my Start up folder - there are
only three things there - Microsoft Find Fast (presumably number 3 in my
list);
Office Start Up, and HP Picture Link (presumably part of my scanner
software).
What 5 of the other 7 programs running are, who knows?  There should be some
way
of looking at a part of a file to find out what its function is and what
application it is attached to.

By the way, the crashes I am getting are of two types:
1. Freezes - requires pressing reset button.
2. A blue DOS-type screen with a message like this:
"An exception 0E has occurred at 0028: C002 AFD6 in VxD IFSMGR(01) + 0000
38D2.
This was called from 0028:C104 CB0E in VxD VTDI(01) + 0000 00BA.  It may be
possible to continue normally."
(It never is, and sometimes I get one like this:)
"A fatal exception 0E has occurred at 0028: C002 AFD6 in VxD IFSMGR(01) +
0000
38D2.  The current application will be terminated."
Once this has happened, Communicator can usually be restarted but is always
very
unstable, and to get it working at all, you need to re-boot.  After a crash
like
this, I tried shutting down FindFast and OSA using Control-Alt-Del, then
restarting Communicator, but it was still unstable.

PS Goofy - I Tried your suggestion:  prefs.js is not read only on my
system -
"Archive" was selected.!

Thank you for your help. I'm getting nowhere with this. I've created the
bat file like you suggested, and set the env vars to the best of my
knowledge. I ran the bat file.

Now it's time to:

namke \f client.mak build_all

but wait! No nmake on my system! Why? Oh well, I may very well give up
within a day.

I've used them for a year now, and their software works with all
browsers I've tried except Mozilla. The actual "viewbar" uses IE 5 to
display the ads, but you can use any browser you like to surf.

Colin -

Popping up an alert on JavaScript errors seems to interact with an unrelated
bug, which I believe was introduced on March 2 or 3.  Bringing up any kind
of alert at all (e.g. by executing alert("Hi, I'm an alert!") from
JavaScript) brings up a number of beeps and asserts on the console, on debug
builds.  Could it be that bug that's causing your crashes?  Could you try
running Mozilla on a page with alert() calls to see if that has the same
behavior?

I'm working on tracking down the checkin that introduced this behavior, but
it could take a while...

I have used Netscape for years, and am used to Communicator 4.08. 
I have begun to suspect it for crashes, so am considering 
options, including Navigator 4.08 as a web browser. 
I presently use W95B and will shortly go to W98SE on a home 
machine. I have 98 MB EDO RAM with my P166MMX. 

Just as a web browser, using a Mozilla with 
a classic skin, what advantages are there to Mozilla over 
Navigator 4.08?

The website say Mozilla needs a 233 machine, and I see comments 
on slow loading. Will it run  on my 166 machine?  

If so, will it be slower than I'm used to in Netscape 4.08?

TIA

My problem was finally solved by people on Bugzilla.
It is a known issue: bug reports 41057 and 42184, for
instance, refer to the same.

I always did the installation of mozilla binaries as a
root, because that required write access to dirs in
/usr/local. After that, when I did the attempt to run it,
I did so as a non-privileged user. The idea to start a
browser as a root is not very appealing. However, apparently
mozilla requires the very first run to be done by a user
that has write access to the dir tree of the installation.
I have no idea why it is so.

Here is part of the answers which my bug report got:

Suddenly, I am no longer able to send email (windows 98, netscape v 4.7)

When I click on send, the following message pops up:

"This operation requires authentication. please enter user name and
password".

Nothing, no settings, were changed, that I know of anyway.  Can someone
give me a hand in solving this so I can send email again please?

I believe the procedure is to find the associated correct bug (or create one
if none exists) put:    beta1      in the keyword  area after logging into
bugzilla.  You can also add a comment on why you think its PDT+ worthy for
beta1.  This will alert the PDT team when they do a database search, and
will then review the bug for PDT+ inclusion worthiness.

n/m  ....   must have been due to the morning horkage ... seems to be
working just fine now .... in fact ... with the afternoon nightly
2000030913 I think i'm going to start using moz on a semi-regular basis
since its now stabalized and fairly inclusive in the browser area.  Can't
wait for beta1 and beyond to see how good a browser it can be :-)

Only thing its missing is the suport my Alladvantage.com viewbar has for
detecting an IE window for "surfing" time ... hmmm, guess thats up to
alladvantage to plug into moz in the future :-)

Cheers,
Mike

Prior to updating to Communicator 4.7,  my homepage always
opened in full screen.  Now it opens in minimumized screen
(tiny).  I know there is a proceedure to set the size of the
opening screen.  However, following hours of frustration,  I
have determined that I am slowly getting dumber and dumber.
Can't remember how it works - nor can I find any information
in "help" files that mentions my problem.

I am now at the mercy of the wonderful brains of the
newsgroups.   H-E-L-P  !!!

Believe this is a problem of the specific site - and not your software.  In
other words, the site has not kept their various certificates updated.  This is
quite common.  Your software likely gives you details regarding the slight
mismatch of the "signature" and says it may not be a serious breach.  I get
this same thing Michelle.

Does Mozilla currently support unicode?

I can't view hebrew pages correctly  i.e:   http://www.maariv.co.il

The fonts should appear left to right but instead they render like western 
alphabet

IE5.x does the job right.



thanks in advance,

Opera now includes a mouse gesture system (Draw a simple image and the

http://www.operasoftware.com/windows/mouse.html

Anyone feel like programming this into mozilla?  If you've ever used it
in Black and White by Lionhead, Maya by Alias|Wavefront (I think it's
there, not 100% sure though), or 3ds max by Descreet, it can be pretty
useful.  You get instant access to a command, without having to move the
mouse to click an icon, nor do you have to read a pulldown menu.  You
move the mouse, and the computer knows what you want to do.

Does anyone else have a problem where opening a link in a new window
stops responding (I'm using Ctrl-Left click in win2k)?

It's happened to me 2 times so far, I'm just wondering if it's my net
connection or mozilla.


The closest thing I can find is
I'm trying to reproduce it
first.http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66032
Bug 66032 - Browser lockup

I don't think this is the exact same thing I'm seeing though, so I'm
thinking of filing a new one... once I can reproduce it.

Does anyone else have a problem where opening a link in a new window
stops responding (I'm using Ctrl-Left click in win2k)?

It's happened to me 2 times so far, I'm just wondering if it's my net
connection or mozilla.


The closest thing I can find is
I'm trying to reproduce it
first.http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=66032
Bug 66032 - Browser lockup

I don't think this is the exact same thing I'm seeing though, so I'm
thinking of filing a new one... once I can reproduce it.

I was attempting to reply to a post cross-posted to four
newsgroups on Usenet and obtained a message from Mozilla
saying I could only post to one newsgroup at a time.  I
noticed in the ground rules at

http://www.mozilla.org/community.html

that one should only post to one newsgroup at a time and
expect that this ground rule has been coded into Mozilla.

So I replied to the cross-posted message in my usual
newsgroup and have received no response from the prior
poster who very likely should have responded if he had
seen my post.  It is likely he is looking at a newsgroup
different than mine in the cross-post list.  And so the
result is that people from two different newsgroups are
not having a useful discussion that would otherwise take
place without this restriction.  My impression is that
this restriction for Usenet newsgroups is excessive.

Regards,

Neil Nelson

Other useful ideas:

-- Close Netscape, and remove all files in the .netscape/cache directory,
or perhaps write a script to do just that.

-- Try Opera.  I believe they just released a beta version for Linux.

Mozilla Milestone 14 (and previous builds) crash upon startup. I found
that removing ZoneAlarm, a firewall, from the system solved the problem.

With the sole exception of demon.net, not a single non-US site AFAICT,
and nothing which would warrant "international" features such as
non-ASCII charsets...

Just an observation.

Ok, you wanna hear something pathetic?  Try using Mozilla on a P75 system=
 with 24
megs or RAM.  I wait a bout 10- 15 seconds for Netscape 4.5 to start up..=
 but then
it moves along quit good.

I wait probably 2 minutes for Mozilla to load up and then still get to lo=
ok
forward to long delays in moderately simple window changes (like resizing=
 or even
typing in a URL!).

If the the finished product isn't faster then this...  this computer is n=
ever
going to see Mozilla (final) on it.  When I tried the Gecko layout engine=
 when it
first came out, it was a little slower then my normal netscape, but ever =
since
it's just been gettin slower and slower.  If I understand correctly, thes=
e slow
down's have been from the use of the XPTool kit thingy that renders the m=
enus and
UI.  I wonder if we would get the same ol performance we had when Gecko f=
irst came
out, if we had a way to convert all this XP stuff to plain ol' (whatever =
it's
called) Windows UI crap (like the current navigator uses)?

I understand that the good factor about this is the ease of use for trans=
lating
for UNIX and Mac and all the other OS's out there...  but from a Windows =
(95) user
stand point, I don't care.  I want a good browser that won't hog up my ha=
rd drive,
and won't make me go to sleep using it.  It this means using Eudora for m=
y e-mail,
and the old Gecko engine ....  I just might!   haha

I'm just thinkin about making this catch on in the real world.  Yeah..  b=
ecause of
it's inter-polarity.. it might catch on really good for the users of Linu=
x or ppl
who are serving a web site or something....  high demand.  But for the ma=
jority of
the ppl out there on the net...  this isn't going to benefit them at all.=


I'm not tryin to gripe about mozilla being too slow...  heck, my PC is th=
e slow
one.  But, just remember there are still ppl out there using old computer=
s and it
might be a good idea to make a version that wouldn't be so slow on them.

Just some ideas.

That's crazy!  I run Windows perfectly fine.  I can usually run  a couple=
 Netscape
windows, a couple notepad windows, and a couple explorer windows all at t=
he same time,
while running ICQ, AIM, and other *background* applications.  I never run=
 into the kind of
trouble when I close everything (except explorer and systray) and try moz=
illa.exe.

I have everything enabled in netscape, including java, 7680 k of disk cac=
he and 1024 k of
mem cache, as for my "internet experience" I am gettin 95% of it (my gues=
s). I use this
beast to do my web browsing, e-mail, web page building .. everything.  So=
 I don't see why
I want to get a new computer ...  or upgrade it..   just for mozilla.

Yeah.. what makes me really mad is that if I go and look in the newspaper adds today..
I could get a 450 MHz K6-II or something for the same price as I got mine... but that
will always be that way.

If mozilla.org doesn't change the rendering over to the old style....  Netscape/AOL is
gonna have to .. of they might not be able to say it's the "fastest browser" like MS did
with IE5.  (And I bet they will wanna use that.. considering one key feature of the
rendering engine is..  ahh... speed.

I hope.

This performance thing has to be fixed.  Mozilla would be great (on the
performance scale) if it still used the same ol' rendering.  I understand
why (on a broad scale) it isn't using it...   I just hope Netscape/AOL
(or someone else...*branded*) will make a version with the same features
except with the old rendering.

You wanna see the animation?  Get a dial-up account like the majority of the net

I am using the scrip below to refresh a page without a frame at the 
bottom.  This isn't working in Netscape 6.  Is there a script I could 
use that would work, or a way to fix this one so that it will?   I need 
it to work on Explorer too (this script does). 

Thanks a million!

  <SCRIPT LANGUAGE=JAVASCRIPT TYPE="TEXT/JAVASCRIPT">
      <!-- Hide script from old browsers

      if (top.location != self.location) {
          top.location = self.location
      }
      // End hiding script from old browsers -->
  </SCRIPT>

What files should I be looking at repairing?

Hello !

I have a PowerCenter 150 (MacOS), Communicator 4.5 french version,
bookmarks to import from Microsoft Exchange  (PC).

Is there a tool to convert Microsoft Exchange adressbook into Netscape ?
The import function of my Communicator doesn't work.

Thanks

just installed mozilla-i686-pc-linux-gnu-sea-M18.tar.gz...

I am impressed
- it works just fine
- it's better than netscape
- congratulations to all developpers

PS

I'd use it instead of netscape if it was faster
- eg.: startup on K6 350MHZ - 60MB RAM
- mozilla M18: 6s
- netscape 4.75: 3s

Hi all,

Mozilla is in good shape now.  It's fast, and it's great!! Good job
guys!

Ok, enough of ranting....

I would just like to point out though, Mozilla running on a Win32
machine (current I am on a NT box) consume quite an amount of memory. (I
am using the daily installer build) Here are some stats:

I have two Mozilla windows opened.  The mem usage is this: 24856K and VM
size is 26040K (All are optained from WinNT's Task Manager.  It's on the
first by sorting in "MemUsage".

On the other hand I ran Netscape 4.72 as well, with 5 windows opened
with extra stuff like the newsgroup and composer view that I am
currently using.  The total mem usage is:
    MemUsage: 23432K  VM Size: 19464K
before I open the newsgroup window and composer window, it's about
19xxxK for MemUsage... but it's ranked second anyway.

Did anyone have talked about this before?  Is it because all of the DLL
modules are loaded? I am kind of surprised to see Mozilla is the largest
consumer on my system (right now I mean) consider the binary code is
only about 9-10MB.

Regards,
Patrick

Just tried to restart Mozilla and it's mem usage is 15MB... oh my...(maybe
there are memory leaks already in startup) but anyway, good work.... hope the
lizard become smaller when it comes out in the stable release.

Simplest is to re-install netscape.

How about the basics

a) What condition is the pilotchute in?
b) Is the right size?
c) Is the kill-line correct?
d) Is the bridal min. required length?

There are a number of reasons to change, enough people have made various
mods.
They have work fine and been very happy with them.

Pin-pull jumpers with shoulder injuries, have put the pad and pin on top of
the pilotchute to avoid snatch.

Why not reverse the idea on throwaway.  Although you may have to be careful
with the initial throw as the pilotchute is already catching air and may go
out through the front of your arm, if you are lazy deploying it.

I think that there are a bunch of leaks in mozilla.  One especially big one
is that pages with animated gifs can leak up 1 meg per minute.

See bug 30385:
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30385

It was marked fixed on 15 March, so in the newest nightly builds it should
leak less.  Mozilla is still a ways from shipping, so leaks are to be
expected :-)

Hope this helps,
Pete Doyle

e.g. 
"4.15 pm Thursday" 

I need them to say e.g.

"16/03/2000" or similar

I've tried the edit preferences, view header, view message, date in

DOES ANYONE HAVE KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERIENCE PLEASE.

It is very similar to a recent mozilla build, but has Java, flash, AOL
messenger on it. Also the animated logo (in top right) is very cool.

Hi, has anyone got a build (win32 or linux for that matter) of mozilla
based on the oct 31 1998 code ?
I was curios to know how different is is from M14 and other recent
builds.
The screenshots on mozillazine have wet my apetite.
Was the code originally released called Netscape Classic?

Peter (who collects browsers)

Apologies if this lot is in an faq, if so can someone post it's url?

It seems that Mozilla now contains code that copies each url you visit
into a OS readable textfile that can then be read by anyone on the
internet (particulary Media Matrix). This seems to mean that anyone
could know exactly which sites you are visiting. If this doesn't scare
you, i don't know what will. It scares the crap out of me.

Allthough many OS's are easy to spy on, that is no excuse for making it
even easier by putting spyware into Mozilla.

If you agree, please visit the bug that is trying to get the spy code
out of Mozilla and into the Nestscape tree (aparently Netscape/AO-HELL
doesn't care about people spying on us, but i intend to always use
Mozilla anyways).

OK, I filed a bug about needing the ability to cross post.

This is just an unecessary hindrance to the occasional need to cross 
post. See bug:

Mozilla sould NOT prohibit Cross-Posting

If people are asking this all the time, that pretty much answers your second
question.  This is probably why MS put an 'X' close button on theirs.

I doubt that users looking to get rid of it are likely to try customizing it.
Then again, they seem to tolerate Start>Shutdown...

Calm down. Of course Mozilla does DHTML. What Mozilla doesn't do is 
support non-standard document object models such as document.all or
document.layers[]. DHTML is basically simply the action of changing
CSS rules on the fly using some type of scripting language.

> Mozilla /Netscape are supposed to be putting out an IE killer.

"Supposed"? Where in the Mozilla mission statement does it say anything
about killing IE or Microsoft?.

It does however say that:
"Mozilla is an open-source web browser, designed for standards-compliance,
performance and portability"

That's what's going on. Nobody is killing IE here so holster that gun.

Does anyone here know how cookies work in Netscape. If I was writing an
app to download a web page and I needed to send a cookie (for login) how
would I go about doing that? I can get the page alright, but Im having a
lot of trouble trying to find information on sending cookie data. Thanks

MOzilla *doesn't* do DHTML ?!!!!!

What do you mean it doesn't. 

It had better before it get's on the Market!

I belong to an Electronics Service Industry Association (NESDA).

I can tell you many of the Electronics Groups Tech Support Sites are going
to DHTML as quick as they can.

Mozilla /Netscape are supposed to be putting out an IE killer. Something
Once it comes out will cause everyone including MicroSoft to Switch to Netscape.

I give this notice on this newsgroup as well.
Apple macintosh OS 9 is incompatible with any form of Talkback Full Circle.
any Machine with OS 9 will crash hard with a -119 system error.

There is even a explaination of why the -119 error. They've changed the file
tracking system to keep track of more open files and folders.

So don't waste your time installing Talkback unless the code has been
changed since OS 9's coming on the market.

Actually, since the rollout of Communicator 4.7 you can do the same with POP
mail as well as Imap.

Edit > Preferences > Mail & newsgroups > Mail Server. Click on name of Mail
Server then click on Edit. When edit window opens click tab that says POP.
You can set "Leave messages on Server" and "Delete on server when deleted
locally". Uhh Huh, Uhh Huh!

I don't need any buggy software. I thought with this "open source deal" we
were supposed to have enough programers all over the world working on Moz to
kill "all" bugs.

A bug they couldn't correct in Netscape Communicator 4.0.x to 4.x.x.
versions killed "Bookmarks sorting" that was available in 3.x.x versions. 

Fixing some bugs in 4.7 in 4.7. 2 created the bug that emptying trash no
longer compacts folders. Previously in version back to 1.x if you deleted
files in any folders (inbox, templates, sent, Trash etc.) it would
automatically compact those folders to purge the deleted info. No more - now
you have to compact all folders individually one by one! Fun Fun Fun!

So any bugs other than to cosmetics had better be gone!

I don't see why Netscape didn't do like IE did. Just remove all traces of a
propriatery Java engine and code, and rewrite so that it simply uses APPLE
MRJ Engine 100% Compatible for Mac, Suns MJR for Unix, and MS Java Engine
for PC. WE could have had Netscape 5 or 6 out two years ago. (In fact we
might even be up to Netscape 10 by now).

According to Head Honchos at Netscape That was a Bug. They inadvertently
left out the Code to do it then couldn't figure out how to put it back in
without breaking other stuff.

I have used 3.01.a on up. This was infact a "major feature at least from
that point up.

Once again a Head Honcho at Netscape said the feature was "accidentally
broke" in the Mac version because They didn't have enough Mac resources
(programmers and Machines) to catch the Mistake. Now they unsure whether
they can reinsert the code to make it work. Duh! If I didn't hate Microsoft
so much and Love Netscape so much I'd switch.

That sound good to me.  Make it so that it maintains 100% compatibility
automatically as changes occur using just one engine. You've got millions of
Programers working looks like someone could come up with something.

I'm not talking about fixing Netscape problems in the Mozilla Group. what I
am talking about is allowing buggy  (major Bugs) go out in a shipping
program I am using Netscape Bugs as a reference why not.

THat would suit Me. By the way Apple MRJ is 100% with Sun JDK 1.1.8 (not
just a subset) so using the Apple Java engine is basically using the SUN
Java Engine now. And will contue to be as Sun makes changes.

That's the problem. Sites using awt calls don't work in Netscape. It does in
the Darkside.
and the experimental Plugin to make compatible only accepts ebbed tags only.
Darkside allows (because it uses the Apple MRJ engine) accepts anything.
Since Apple MRJ 2.2 is basically SUN SDK 1.1.8 in Apple's clothing.

This actually a Mozilla Project List.

Moz Nightly Mac 15 Nightly March 29 Problems.

I still can't Close preferences with the okay button. You can click on Okay
button a zillion times and it just sits there. the only way to dismiss the
preferences panel is to click cancel.

This Is Not The Way Its Supposed To Work!

Next the "save as" Command shows that its been activated. It has not.

Also, once again I use a 15" Monitor (don't have physical Room for anything
larger) I still have to Manually move the preference window up enough to get
to Cancel and Okay Controls. PLeaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!!!!!!!!!!! I'm begging
you fix it. (Stop using hard numbers for width and Height and use
percentages - if that's the problem.) About 85% of use web surfers use a 15"
monitor despite most programers feeling everyone is using 27" monitors. I've
begged and pleaded about this once before evidently it fell on deaf years.

Come on Fellows let's get on the stick.

If you haven't been subscribed to the Group. Subscribe Allow all headers
to be downloaded, Subscribe then Do a Find on GNKSA 2 you find several
threads on the subject. Some of the Folks claim to even be part of the
committee or at least contributors.

Garth your Right. the people posting on USENET are wrong. 

I did a research on GNKSA 2. I went to GINKSA 2 website.

The limit is 80 characters and 4 Lines in Length.

The GNKSA 1.2 document you quoted doesn't determine a line length for
Signatures. According GNKSA 2.0 an 80 character length. (Although it
doesn't specifiy whether it includes spaces as caharacters).

If you want to examine GNKSA 2.0 go to<http://www.xs4all.nl/~js/gnksa/index.html>

 Read:<http://www.xs4all.nl/~js/gnksa/gnksa.txt>

Browser, Proxy-Servers & Firewalls add arbitrary Headers if you
use them. So, I heard that the Mac-Version of the Internet Explorer
also transmits the CPU-Type.

Since it's impossible for me to check Web-Requests for any type of
Browser, Proxy-Server & Firewall I've made a CGI-Program which
will save all arbitrary HTTP-Headers. Please go to

http://www.in.tum.de/cgi-bin/ucgi/pircher/set.cgi

to support my investigations. There your Browser-Environment will
be saved and you will also see what your Combination of Browser,
Proxy-Server & Firewall will transmit to any Target-Server.

I would also be glad, if anyone can provide me a list or more
information which (additional) Headers are transmitted at HTTP-
Requests!

Thank you very much,
 Alex

Paul Harvey Poem and Riddle

Here is a pretty neat little thing from Paul Harvey.  See if you can gues=
s the riddle at the end. =


Paul Harvey Writes:  We tried so hard to make things better for our kids =
that we made them worse.  For my grandchildren, I'd like better.  I'd rea=
lly like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cre=
am and leftover meat loaf sandwiches, I really would.  I hope you learn h=
umility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being cheated.=
  I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car=
=2E  And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixt=
een. =


It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your ol=
d dog put to sleep.  I hope you get a black eye fighting for something yo=
u believe in, I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brothe=
r.  And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the =
room,  but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's =
scared,  I hope you let him.  When you want to see a movie and your littl=
e brother wants to tag along,  I hope you'll let him.  I hope you have to=
 walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town wher=
e you can do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I ho=
pe you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be =
seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom.  If you want a slingshot,=
 I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying one.  I ho=
pe you learn to dig in the dirt and read books.  When you learn to use co=
mputers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head.  I hope =
you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a girl, =
and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory soap tast=
es like.  May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a=
 stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if you t=
ry a beer once, but I hope you don't like it.  And if a friend offers you=
 dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.  I sure hope =
you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go fishing with you=
r Uncle.  May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.  =
I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your ne=

Paul Harvey Poem and Riddle

Here is a pretty neat little thing from Paul Harvey.  See if you can gues=
s the riddle at the end. =


Paul Harvey Writes:  We tried so hard to make things better for our kids =
that we made them worse.  For my grandchildren, I'd like better.  I'd rea=
lly like for them to know about hand me down clothes and homemade ice cre=
am and leftover meat loaf sandwiches, I really would.  I hope you learn h=
umility by being humiliated, and that you learn honesty by being cheated.=
  I hope you learn to make your own bed and mow the lawn and wash the car=
=2E  And I really hope nobody gives you a brand new car when you are sixt=
een. =


It will be good if at least one time you can see puppies born and your ol=
d dog put to sleep.  I hope you get a black eye fighting for something yo=
u believe in, I hope you have to share a bedroom with your younger brothe=
r.  And it's all right if you have to draw a line down the middle of the =
room,  but when he wants to crawl under the covers with you because he's =
scared,  I hope you let him.  When you want to see a movie and your littl=
e brother wants to tag along,  I hope you'll let him.  I hope you have to=
 walk uphill to school with your friends and that you live in a town wher=
e you can do it safely. On rainy days when you have to catch a ride, I ho=
pe you don't ask your driver to drop you two blocks away so you won't be =
seen riding with someone as uncool as your Mom.  If you want a slingshot,=
 I hope your Dad teaches you how to make one instead of buying one.  I ho=
pe you learn to dig in the dirt and read books.  When you learn to use co=
mputers, I hope you also learn to add and subtract in your head.  I hope =
you get teased by your friends when you have your first crush on a girl, =
and when you talk back to your mother that you learn what ivory soap tast=
es like.  May you skin your knee climbing a mountain, burn your hand on a=
 stove and stick your tongue on a frozen flagpole.  I don't care if you t=
ry a beer once, but I hope you don't like it.  And if a friend offers you=
 dope or a joint, I hope you realize he is not your friend.  I sure hope =
you make time to sit on a porch with your Grandpa and go fishing with you=
r Uncle.  May you feel sorrow at a funeral and joy during the holidays.  =
I hope your mother punishes you when you throw a baseball through your ne=
ighbor's window and that she hugs you and kisses you at Christmas time wh=
en you give her a plaster mold of your hand.  These things I wish for you=

 Is there a newsgroup or website for the Mozilla Editor component?

I've just started playing with it and it seems like it has a lot of
potential but is currently half-functional. I'm using the one out of
CVS.

It could be that I am just missing something key, however.  I was able
to start making simple web pages, but I was unable to edit any
preexisting page that I loaded in.  It could be because all the pages I
tried to load use CSS1...

I'd like to find out where all the people using & working on the Editor
component hang out.

thanks
Preston

Hi,

        For our research project,  I need to build a tool based on
Mozilla.    We want the mozilla to read from a text file that is a list
of URLs and load all the URLs one after another instead of waiting for
user events.    Is this task doable?
I will try to build it on RedHat Linux 6.1.
        I am new to Mozilla and I just took a brief look at Mozilla
source code.    It seems to me that the Main program is within
xpfe/Main/main.cpp    and seems that the xpfe would be the module I
should work with to accomplish the task.   Is this right?  Does anyone
have any suggestions on how to do it?    Or is there any way to do it
other than modifying the mozilla source code?
        From the binary executable I run on Windows 98,  I find a nice
feature that Netscape does not have.  The status bar of Mozilla will
show the response time took for a URL to load.    I am interested in
keeping a time log for all my URLs.   Does anyone know where to look for
the response time in the source code?

       Thank you very much for any help.

As Mozilla approaches beta, XMLterm finally approaches alpha.
Check out the new screenshots at http://xmlterm.org.
On Linux/Solaris, XMLterm can now be compiled simply by setting
the configure option --with-extensions=xmlterm.
XMLterm can also be used as a powerful Javascript console (see
http://xmlterm.org/shots/js.html).

If you are a Linux mozilla user who also uses xterms in some form,
please try out the M14-compatible version of the XMLterm binaries,
which may be downloaded from http://xmlterm.org/install.html.
Remember this is pre-alpha software; so don't delete your xterm
binaries just yet! There are still many bugs and unimplemented
features, but any feedback on the "feel" of XMLterm will be
appreciated.

I presume you are using the nightly build dated  20000303, not the "stock" M14
release version from the "releases/m14" mozilla FTP directory. The error message
suggests that the interface nsServiceManager has changed since the M14 branch was
cut. Since mozilla is under active development, interfaces keep changing all the
time and any older dynamically linked library will fail to link. In the future, the
XMLterm extension may be enabled in the nightly builds, so this won't be a problem.
At the moment, I don't see any option other than to use the "stock" M14 release
build, or compile XMLterm yourself.

If you have problems linking to the M14 release build, do let me know.

Saravanan

PS. When I run the command
nm -D libxpcom.so | grep GetService
in the mozilla/dist/bin/directory, one of the output lines is
[1522]  |    555860|      68|FUNC |GLOB |0
|116|GetService__16nsServiceManagerRC4nsIDRC4nsIDPP11nsISupportsP19nsIShutdownListener

Apparently the symbol is present in my version of libxmlterm.so but not in yours.

Hi,

How do I update Mozilla with the latest build? I mean, now, if I want to get
the latest version (nightly), I just download the entire package from
ftp.mozilla.org. However, the setup file is pretty big (around 7-8 MB) and I
also have to reinstall all the plugins... (PSM, Flash etc.). So, is there a
way to get only the parts that changed. I don't want to compile the source
code or something, I just want to update my Mozilla more easily.

Sorry if this is off-topic...

I want to use linux/netscape/imap mail and leave the messages on the

Can Netscape be told to leave the messages on the server when using

Dear All:

This may not be the right group to post to, but, have tried 4 other
NS Groups without solution, so, please forgive my hoping someone here
can help:

This problem beats all, as the title bar menu in NS 3.04gold has been
altered by programming from a Japanese search engine:

"Kaixi Search Engine" http://www2d.biglobe.ne.jp/~kinryou/cgi/index.html

Starting with title bar heading "Bookmarks" the menu reads down,
including that in the following order:

Bookmarks
Add Bookmark CTRL+D
Go to Bookmarks CTRL+B
Kaixi Search Engine (which takes me to the URL noted above)

How it got on my menu beats me, except I may have accessed this Japanese
language only site in error and some how it infected my menu. 

How to get it off my menu also beats me. I have searched high and low in
the base program Netscape.exe for "Kaixi" to no avail. If the 
programming is in Japanese I would not recognize.

I have also searched my -C- drive and Windows Registry for any of the
"terms" Kaixi/Search/www2D, to no avail.

Any suggestions would be appreciated.

Thanks,

Gordon

I assumed it was not "normal" but your response proves at least you are
abnormal. You must read EMails before you expose further a very narrow
mind.

If someone can't figure out Version 3 we face real deep do-do with
Version 5, which, I understand, will actually  be version 6 to keep up
with MS IE versions, cascading style sheets etc.

Between AOL sucks and NS Mozilla elitists, I guess a direct EMail to
Mark Andreesen would no doubt engender a solution, but if not, at least
a nicer reply.

I place no expectations on the knowledge of others. Some of the most
seemingly ignorant people are genius and helpful in many circumstances,
and nicer, of course.

Says something about NS diehards giving in to reality, it seems. I have
MSIE 5 and it is the total pits compared to NS 3 and especially to 
NS 4 and above.

Robert:

Though the site is not in English, I will try to find some way, even
a blind to Postmaster/Webmaster or whatever and see what happens.

With the help of 2 now, plus a nice message from a prior NS owner I
feel some progress toward a solution is being made.

Thanks for your kind and very nice reply; it is appreciated and very
helpful knowledge-wise re version code variances.

I'm not a website designer, I just browse, and this surprised me, since I'm on
Win32 and one of my major gripes with Moz is the horrific time it takes to
load compared to Netscape 4.7 and IE5. Guess it's something wrong with my
system ....

	May well be -- I have 64 MB RAM, 400 Mhz PII, and am running way too many
little background programs. And I'm not using the nightly builds ... maybe I
should. Will see, I guess =)

Hello!

would anyone know how to transfer the contents of private address books
from one user profile to another?

(currently migrating from Compuserve which gave very poor service
lately, to another provider.

Thanks in advance.

Is anybody interested in a prog. that completely maximizes a Navigator

Sometimes it's handy.  I'm more or less just practicing posting.
If so, please advise where to up it...

See http://www.mozilla.org/newlayout/bugathon.html#layerbugs

You send feedback to the webmaster, mark the bug INVALID, and put 
[LAYER] in the whiteboard.  CC ekrock@netscape.com for good measure.

Note that just because there are LAYERS or document.layers or 
document.all doesn't mean that there is no bug on the page.  Always try 
to view the page with javascript off (if it's a document.layers) problem 
or save to disk and edit out all the LAYER tags, to see if there's not 
another problem.

Plenty of pages, e.g., use standard JS functions to provide mouseover 
effects using document.layers.  These should really work in Mozilla as 
without the mouseover effect.  Just yesterday I looked at 
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30014 : full of 
document.layer and document.all, but there was actually another problem.

Well, make one ;) and then put in the testcase keyword.

Jan Leger once sent me a list of those, but I lost it.  It would be nice 
if it were linked from http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describekeywords.cgi

In terms of layout bugs, I haven't seen any where it was possible to 
confirm there was a bug AND diagnose it enough to assign it to the 
correct component without diagnosing it sufficiently to provide a 
simplified testcase.  I'd say if you can't add enough information to the 
bug report to make it clear what the problem is (so that engineers can 
decide who owns it, whether it's a duplicate, etc.) then leave it 
UNCONFIRMED, so that others can see immedaitely that it needs attention.

Why don't you use a standards-compliant browser, such as Mozilla, to use 
the feedback page? ;-)   Seriously, just send yourself some feedback 
mails and you know what should be in the emails, or I'll send them to you.

Mozilla/Netscape 6  <http://www.mozilla.org/> will have the date format 
like you want it.  Beta available soon.

It's a planned feature.  See
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=15865

Right now, IMAP mails are not kept locally, just the headers.  Same for
news.

There are two bugs filed on this:
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31873
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=32094

I don't think there is another way to conditionally load
style sheets short of doing it server-side. Have a look at Eric Krock's 
pages at

http://developer.netscape.com/viewsource/krock_v5.html

This confuses me.  I did import my address book from 4.7, using File | 
Import from an LDIF file into which I had previously exported my address 
book.  Was that turned off? Or are you just talking about importing 
abook data directly (not using LDIF export first) and in the profile 
migration?

I use a copy that I compiled on Jul 16 1999 as my everyday browser. This was

Chatzilla is not working in M14 :(

I created a bugzilla bugreport #31765 about this and it turns out
that Chatzilla doesn't start up in current builds due to bug #29053.

We have a similar problem (Netscape Navigator 4.04).

We have a form, with select fields, radio buttons and hidden fields. We use
javascript to write the value of the select field (or any field) to the
corresponding hidden field for later validation. If you resize the browser
window, the value of the hidden field is "lost" i.e. set to null.

Can anyone throw any light on this please?

Thank you.

I do build all of my sites to display with Mozilla correctly, then
looking if they are viewable on IE5 and Nav4.7 - and I must admit that
I'll love the day when I can close out Nav4.7 from testing. That'll make
life much more easy...

And look for dupes... I think a lot of the RFE/not yet implemented are included in
existing RFE (or other) bugs....

That's probably the best (shortest) description I ever read of what a bug needs to
be comfirmed.

You can get some tips by going over to http://lxr.mozilla.org/seamonkey/ and doing
a Text search for some important word which could be in the affected code. The
filenames you'll get (and their paths) could be a great help to guess the
component...

> <snip>

A general opinion (of me): We'll get more and more UNCONFIRMED bugs after raeching
beta status and thus increasing download rates. So we should tell people somewhere
how to confirm them (without using votes). And we should tell people who want to
go through them how to (more or less easily) find the right components and
possible dupes....

Just my 2 cents...

Only a small point but I'm following that bug almost since it was created...
"position: " seems to be in, for example - but "position: fixed" seems to be a
real problem (though it is implemented...) --> see bug #4209.

That's how a small part of a bigger point can cause major problems - if it stays
implemented this way... (UI crap inside a HTML page looks like a major problem
for me - what if the small image at the bottom right of
http://www.unet.univie.ac.at/~a9805220/links/links.html was filling the page?)

The "votehelp" page does need an update. Some time ago, you could use up to
5 votes per bug for every product but due to some changes browser and
mailnews products now allow only one vote per bug. Webtools still allow to
use up to 5 votes per bug.

They needed to do that due to some other changes (the "unconfirmed" state -
which gets "new" if there are enough bugs).

I'm cross-posting that to the webtools NG 'cause BugZilla is part of
webtools...

Terry (am I right bugzilla is your thing?), I think there should be an
update to http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/votehelp.html including new voting
rules and the influence of votes to the "unconfirmed" state...

On one hand Mozilla/Netscape 6.0 code is very different from 3.x or 4.x
code as it hasn't kept _any_ code line from there, everything was
rewritten from scratch....

On the other hand, that's a very strange thing which has been happening
to you... I've never seen/read of something like that before. If you
don't fnd someone to respond in Netscape newsgroups (I don't think
anyone in this ng will answer you), then you'll stay with the only
chance to mail that search engine admin - perhaps they will be patient
enough to tell you....

As you're in a Mozilla newsgroup here and Mozilla will be the base for
Netscape 6 (beta is coming in the next weeks!), you'll see it's not "going
steadily downhill".
OTOH, Netscape 4 code won't get better with any "new" 4.xx coming out as
Mozilla was rewritten from scratch and everyone@netscape puts all his
efforts in Mozilla, not in any 4.x code AFAIK...

Hey, if you need a cross-platform, good-working browser - you'll get it!

But all good needs time... so this one, MOZILLA 5.0 (which will be the
base of Netscape 6.0), is a open source cross-platformstandards
compliant skinnable (...) browser (or web machine) software - but it's
"only" getting to beta 1 in the next weeks.
Neverthelles, current trial versions at www.mozilla.org are getting
better and better, it's worth a try...

Just one word: Asa Dotzler won his "Methodical Man" Award at MozillaZine
("for his great work organizing Bug Day, maintaining Brower general
bugs, and helping novice bug reporters become experienced Bugzilla
users.") using a P100/16 MB RAM/600 MB HDD!!!
You see, it's not only that you can _run_ Mozilla a such a machine, you
also can use it to an extent that you can survive being QA contact for
Browser-General bugs, help reporting/maintaining/solving bugs and win an
award for that.
And all that with a product which still eats up a lot of resources being
not-even-beta and not optimized...

What about MOZILLA (www.mozilla.org) ???

It IS cross-platform (at least 97% of the code are...) and so NETSCAPE 6.0
(there will be no 5.0) will be XP, too....

admit that the original poster (and perhaps others) of this thread either
don't know what product this group is about or they want to tell us we are

The skins, the whole UI, IS currently in "text" files - or better XUL
files, the skins being stored in CSS sheets (and, of course, the graphic
files connected to that CSS). And all that is placed in the chrome
directory.
And: nobody is kidding. There _will_ be at least one tool (if not more)
to visually edit those TEXT (meaning CSS/XUL/perhaps even JS) files !!!
Nobody will have to use that tool, everything will stay in those files
(though they may get packed into .jar archives). But you will be able to
use the tool to visually edit skins....

Java2 Runtime Environment 1.3 Release Candidate 1 (directly form Sun!)
is included in the full Netscape 6 beta1 download, from what I've heard.

As Mozilla / Netscape 6 do not include an own Java VM, you can plug-in
every JVM which supports the "Open Java Interface" (OJI -
http://www.mozilla.org/oji), and Sun's does support it. ;-)
You will be able to use the most recent Java releases as soon as they
are available... Isn't that good news?

No, it does still work.

If you have "cat" on your system, you can also run
"mozilla | cat" and the output will show up in your window.

I suggest reading as much documentation on Mozilla.org as you can stand.
Then play around with Mozilla a bit and think about what you would like to
do. And only THEN go to http://lxr.mozilla.org and poke around for the
code related to what you're interested in. (Post here or email me if you
have trouble finding what you want.) Just browsing around can be fun but
it's rarely very productive.

It is there. It does have bugs, but I've managed to make it work in some
cases.

It's not clear-cut. Switch statements are often actually compiled into a
sequence of if's when there are only a few options. On modern machines, a
sequence of if's can actually be faster because the branch predictor is
more likely to speculate through the right code.

You should use a switch if that makes the code look better, or ifs if they
make the code look better, and don't worry about tweaking them unless and
until you determine, through profiling, that these statements have a
significant performance impact.

See above. Worry first about desigining efficient algorithms and getting
the code correct, then profile to find out where it's worth doing stuff
like this. Doing these things in the wrong order usually leads to lots of
unnecessary pain. It is very hard to debug cleverly-optimized code.

It's a convenient fiction that helps the rich and comfortable to sleep a

There are a lot of memory leaks in Mozilla at the moment. In other words,
it will keep growing over time until you quit. If you just start it up and
then immediately check its memory usage, it should not look too bad.

A PIM-type application for Mozilla is definitely a good idea.

However, if you want to start one, this is not the way to do it. Projects
that start by getting a lot of people together for "planning" and swapping
titles (e.g. "co-owner"), invariably fail to go anywhere.

Success is far, far more likely if you keep things to yourself until you
have working code in which people can see both your vision, and how they
can contribute. It also establishes your credibility, which otherwise
starts at zero just like that of any other Random Net Person.

This would be nice to provide.

It would be good for Novell for this to happen ... someone should ask them

Are scrollbars going to look like platform scrollbars, or neither fish nor 
fowl, like M14 for the Mac ? I can understand the technical reasons for 
using cross-platform widgets in controls in HTML content itself (not unlike 
Swing), but the current "chrome" just looks out of place.

Not to NS, but to downloading the upcoming builds- have today downloaded
mozilla-win32-installer.exe
Sounds dumb, but what you I do now? I would assume double click the exe
file and run it, but I also know about assume. I have no other mozilla
build on the machine - just C 4.7 which I plan to keep in a different
directory.
And lastly, how to get the next build and install it.
I Did get PowerStart running again with Kevin's help, so am not a total
loss.
TIA and we'll see what happening tonite.

Hi; That's the latest one that I can find, or connect to and I know Jay
Garcia has 909 as it's in his signature.

I have mozilla-win32-installer.exe which I downloaded today and it has
newsgroups greyed out.  Also Gerv said:"
If, when you first run it, you run "mozilla -installer", it will import
all your NS 4.x settings (without damaging them in NS, of course)."
When I ran mozilla-win32-installer.exe it didn't import anything. I ran
a normal install on C:, my 4.7 is on D:
I'm lurking and trying to catch up- forgive me for being so far
behind....

Can someone tell  me how to delete a 'User Profile' when first opening
Netscape Navigator 4.08 so that the browser will just automatically
open when double clicked rather than me having to choose a user?

My apologies, in advance, if this is the wrong newsgroup to ask this
question in.

is there some sort of compatbility checklist?

1. I think I understand the aims of open source  but does this mean that say
any UIs designed using XUL would not subject to copyright.

2.  Apple lost its look and feel case - so is it pointless to develop a
distinct UI based on Mozilla

3. Are there any/many companies building derivate commercial products from
the Mozilla .

4. If so what types of products would be commercially viable?

Hi
I am working on a project involving preference locking for
Communicator/mozilla.  I have the following questions and am hoping that
someone out there is able to provide some answers:

1) what files are read on start up of the browser for preference
handling?

2) how does the browser use netscape.cfg exactly?

3) is there a readable copy of netscape.cfg available? if not-- is there
some utility available to convert it to .js or some other readable
format?

4) what should a configuration editor load into it's GUI to read all the
default preferences?


thanks-
sabine

This is NOT a normal Netscape newsgroup.  This is for Mozilla, the open
source alpha for Netscape 5.0.

I am trying to import my Netscape portfolio, without avail.  It worked
fine in M13, but I don't feel like going back.  On the mozilla.org web
page, it says to use the command line, but that also seems to be gone in
M14.  Does anyone know how to manage profiles in Mozilla?  Thanx.

I think that would be a great idea.  I am NOT interested in skins (at
the moment), but I am interested in some of the more functional parts of
the UI.  It would be nice to channel the two completely different ideas
into two separate newsgroups.

There may be, however most of them probably don't impose a noticable
performance hit.  The best way to proceed would be to run some profiling
metrics to find out where in the code such optimizations would garner the
most gain, and change them there.

I'd say that cloning IE's method of putting a small 'x' in the upper right
corner to hide the sidebar panel would eliminate all of these issues.

IE has some good UI techniques...we shouldn't be shy about taking
the ones we like.

I think (or at least I /hope/) that that's the MPL, not the NPL, except
where necessary.

The Big String Story:

This is a `heads up' to some immanent changes. As some of you probably
know, Rick Gessner, I, Chris Waterson, and a few others have been
building some new scaffolding around our old familiar friends
|nsString| and |nsCString|.  Profiling and experiments have shown
opportunities for specialized string implementations that could really
help performance (see questions analysis and recommendations in
<http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=28221>).  To that end, we
have factored the current |ns[C]String| interface into three layers.

  - At the very top, an abstract interface providing much of what you
    could do with a |const ns[C]String&|.  It is called
    |nsAReadable[C]String| and is defined in "nsAReadableString.h".
    The 'A' is for 'abstract', as opposed to the 'I' for interface in
    [XP]COM interface classes.

    An |nsAReadable[C]String| gives you much of the interface you
    know and love: |Length|, |IsEmpty|, |CharAt|, |operator[]|,
    |First|, |Last|, |CountChar|, |Left|, |Mid|, |Right|, |Compare|,
    |Equals|, the comparison operators, and |+|.  What it lacks is any
    of the automatic conversion between character encodings.


  - In the middle is an abstract interface providing most of the
    mutating interface from |ns[C]String|.  This interface is called
    |nsAWritable[C]String| and is defined in "nsAWritableString.h".
    It inherits from |nsAReadable[C]String|.

    Writables give you, e.g., |SetCapacity|, |SetLength|, |Assign|,
    |Append|, |Insert|, |Cut|, |+=|, and |=|.


  - The concrete class in this tree remains |ns[C]String|.  In
    addition to inheriting from |nsAWritable[C]String|, it provides
    all the extra functionality that didn't get factored.  If you
    need to get directly to the buffer with |GetBuffer| or
    |GetUnicode|, or if you exploit implicit encoding conversions,
    then you will find those powers here.

Providing distinct abstract readable and writable interfaces lets us
plug new implementations in, after we get these new interface
deployed.  We already have several specialized implementations
working:

  - |nsShared[C]String|: a reference-counted, single allocation,
    heap-allocated, immutable string, good for implementing things
    like atoms

  - |nsLiteral[C]String|: a stack-based wrapper for immutable string
    literals that allows you to use them as Readables without doing
    any copying, i.e., a replacement for many uses of |nsAutoString|.

  - the result of the |Substring| function is a specialized string
    that references the original source without copying it

  - the result of |operator+| applied to Readables is a specialized
    multi-fragment string that references the original sources without
    copying

And in the not too distant future, there will be

  - a multi-fragment implementation that makes large strings that
    happen to be subject a lot of editing, significantly cheaper

  - a version of |nsXPIDL[C]String| that fits into the string tree


Where are we now?

The new interfaces are checked in, but disabled.  They are controlled
by the |#define| |NEW_STRING_APIS|.  They build and run on Mac,
Windows, and Linux, but not yet on Solaris.  There are probably one or
more bugs.  Some things are not yet implemented (e.g., smart-pointers
for shared string and logic for handling self assignment of `promised'
strings).  The unit and performance tests run on Mac and Linux, but
not yet on Windows.  You can find these tests in
xpcom/tests/StringFactoringTests/.

Some effects of the changes are that operators like |+|, |=|, |+=|,
and the comparison operators no longer provide the implicit character
encoding conversions they once did.  In the future, you will have to
use |Append|, |Assign|, |Equals|, and |Compare| to perform these
operations with mixed encodings.  I have already swept through the
tree and fixed all current cases.  In fact, I even want to rename the
mixed encoding functions (more about this below).

Some operations are faster than they once were.  A few operations are
slightly slower than they once were.  Some new interfaces are
available, e.g., though you are now denied direct access to any
underlying buffer through a Readable, it does provide iterators (in
the form of |nsReadingIterator|s).  Here are some sample timings from
the performance tests:
                              raw       factored     ratio
                           --------     --------     -----
  f(s1+s2+s3+s1+s2+s3)      3739799        80959     0.022
  f( s1 + s2 )              1024208        19739     0.019
  s4 = s1+s2+s3+s1+s2+s3    3923804      1437349     0.366
  s4 = s1 + s2              1098484       375384     0.342
  s1 > s2                    263047       285225     1.084
  s1 == s1                   267528        10229     0.038
  s1.CountChar('e')          273329       273993     1.002
  s3.Append(s1);...          975341       977270     1.002
  repeated Appends         24729347     25047779     1.013
  repeated s1.Append('e')  44149849     44176311     1.001
  s2.Insert(s1, 3)          1109978      1087894     0.980


What do we do next?

Chris Waterson and I are getting this stuff to work on Solaris.  Mike
Judge and Pavlov are helping get the unit and performance tests
running on all platforms.  Rick is working on performance improvements
for our core string implementation, and a multi-fragment
implementation.  I'm writing more tests and looking for bugs.  As soon
as we build and run on Solaris, it will be time to turn this stuff on
for everyone.  Then we can start making opportunities for performance
improvements by finding where we can use the abstract interfaces
instead of concrete uses of |ns[C]String|, where a different
implementation could help.  Hopefully, everybody will be helping with
this part.

The factored interfaces are very much just a re-casting of the
|ns[C]String| APIs we already had.  Iterators were added mainly to
allow us to factor the implementations, not necessarily as a
recommended tool for clients.  I expect that as we try to exploit new
implementations, these APIs will have to bend and grow a little.

When we throw the switch, I will post another message with specific
recommendations of code patterns to avoid and to exploit.  I will
include timings on the different platforms.


Further changes that Rick and I want to make are:

  - Rick has a cleaner core implementation for |ns[C]String| that
    includes Copy-On-Write semantics for improved performance

  - I want to make all encoding conversions explicit, and eventually
    move them out of string and back into i18n where they belong.  I
    want to start by renaming the offending routines, e.g.,
    |AppendWithConversion|, |AssignWithConversion|, |EqualsWith...|,
    etc.  In my investigations through the code, it looked like most
    conversions were actually accidental.

  - We want to make |PRUnichar| mean the same thing as |wchar_t|, if
    possible.  That will allow us to directly specify wide string
    literals with, e.g., L"these are two-byte characters".

  - Further factoring, e.g., we haven't gotten around to moving the
    family of |Find| methods up from |ns[C]String| into Readables.

  - Tuning and optimizing

Hope this helps,

Believe it or not, try Mosaic.  On UNIX it is very stable.  And the latest
versions have most of the same features as Mozilla, though not many of the
plugins.

Not sure if this should go into n.p.m.general or n.p.m.builds so please 
advise... anyhow:

1) URLs typed in without the "http://" prefix don't work.  It doesn't 
matter if you type them into the main location field, or pop up the Go To 
Location dialog (CTRL-L). 

2) I am often loosing cursor/highlight in the location field.  Testing 
suggests that the cursor is still doing what I wanted to (positioning, 
selecting, etc), but it's just not visible.  Otherwise it appears to 
behave correctly.

I just want to toss out a huge THANK YOU to everyone involved in getting 
the crypto build of M14 out.  I just got it going and it's been working 
BEAUTIFULLY so far.  I can now do 100% of my daily browsing in Mozilla, 
only kicking up Communicator 4.72 and IE5 when I need to compare output 
for the sake of bug-hunting.  

The installation of the crypto PSM was painless and smooth.  I was VERY 
impressed.

You guys kick ass... keep up the good work!!!

I would think that because the Netscape-branded beta would be released as 
a binary and not source, it could already be packaged up and ready to go 
with crypto.  Dan was talking about the Mozilla beta, which would be a 
different packaged product.  And my interpretation of what he said was 
that it wouldn't become part of the NIGHTLIES until after the beta, but 
that doesn't stop them from plugging it into milestone releases like they 
did for M14.  The first beta would be at a milestone point.

Is there a known memory leak in M14?  On my WinNT box, I notice the 
memory usage of mozilla.exe steadily climb until performance is so awful 
I have to close it and restart it.  I've watched it get as big as 90MB of 
RAM before I caught it and closed it.  This doesn't seem to happen to me 
at home on my Win95 system though.  

Any thoughts?

Just checking in... do any of the nightlies contain crypto yet?  This

If I remember correctly, one of the whole goals of Mozilla was to come 
out with a clean, lean, and mean browser that was SMALLER, required LESS 
RAM and HARD DRIVE SPACE, and was FASTER.  Wouldn't this then imply 
BETTER performance on older systems than Communicator 4.x?  

But this is not the case.  I run Mozilla on a Celeron 300 with 128MB of 
RAM, and the rendering and UI is WAY doggy when compared to Communicator 
4.x or IE5.  Not that I'd ever use IE5, but I have it for testing.

And the fact remains... Mozilla wants the Gecko engine to be used in all 
sorts of internet-enabled devices like cell-phones and so on.  I'm sorry, 
but if Mozilla doesn't kick ass on a Pentium 75, then it's not going to 
be a pleasant experience running it on the processor that'd be inside of 
a cell phone.

Not to be a pessimist... I continue to use Mozilla and advocate it 
heavily.  But I'm discouraged by the lack of focus on performance.

Not working with today's or yesterday's nightly.  :(  I'd rather not go 
back to M14.  Of course, the nightlies don't have Talkback either... so 
all my (many) crashes aren't accomplishing much...

Sure... but the UI isn't the only thing that needs performance tweaks.  
The rendering engine lags too, and this would be the same.

Oh certainly... I realize this.  I just worry when people complain about 
performance problems, instead of seeing responses like "Yeah, we'll start 
tweaking performance after M?? once we've ________" I see responses like, 
"What the hell are you doing running Mozilla on that Pentium 200???  Get 
a new computer!!!"  Feedback like that suggests that performance won't be 
a big priority.  I just want to make sure it's held in its proper spot in 
the list of priorities, despite the comments on here received by people 
who mention performance problems.

Hmm.  Last one I tried it with was 2000032205.  I will download the 
latest nightly and try it again.  Incidentally, I've been using the .ZIP 
version and not the installer, so that I had more control over the 
installation process (at least I know what files are going where).  Do I 
need to use the installer version of the nightlies for this to work?  Do 
I have to copy the psm/ directory from a working M14 install, like you 
have?  And if it is indeed necessary to use the installer version, can 
you tell me what things the installer does differently so I can be aware?  
Additional files placed where, registry changes, etc.  All I have to deal 
with with the ZIPed version is the mozregistry.dat file.

Thanks!

I regularly use the nightly builds of mozilla and update every week or 
so. I've tried to install 2 builds out of the last weeks and both of 
those crashed on startup with the following error:

/home/scott/mozilla/run-mozilla.sh: line 72: 21289

or similar.

However if I rename my .mozilla dir and try it, it works fine.

I'm not sure if this bug has been reported, it could be a dupe of 65314.

It may be that something in my profile has been corrupted.

Has anyone else come across this behaviour? is there a way to 'repair' 
my profile?

Any help would be much appreciated.

	Ok, it's not Mozilla 1.4, it's Milestone 14, meaning this is pre-release software, it hasn't been optimised yet, so it's still slow and buggy. Beta 1 is coming in the near future, but not here yet and there will be significant improvements then I'm sure.

	As for scanning your firewall, I believe Mozilla will have automatic proxy detection like IE when all is said and done.I bet that is what happened. Now for the important question, did it work? Did it find your proxy w/o user intervention?

Could be; I remember having problems when I wrote a mailto: link as
'mailto://user@host' instead of 'mailto:user@host' as it should have
been. The habitual insertion of '//' after the protocol was the
problem.

I had a look at www.winther.net and the pages look exactly the same on
4.72 and latest Mozilla build. Which page do you exactly mean?

Quick fix is to run "mozilla > debug.txt" and have a look at debug.txt
afterwards. There has been a thread about this somewhere with more
proposals but I forgot where.

I experienced this as well (03/04). I have an external JS file which
doesn't contain more than:

function last_changed () {document.write(document.lastModified)}

Loading my site, it complained with a popup about "f" not being defined
(I never call a function f!) and then about "last_changed" not being
defined. It didn't apply the external CSS file which belongs to the page
as well.

I repaired this behaviour by writing:
function last_changed () {document.write(document.lastModified);}

Notice the _;_ at the only instruction of the function.
I didn't get any popups then and the CSS was applied to the page.
Does the last statement in a function have to have a ; ??? Why did it
complain about a function f not being defined when there is never a "f"
called?
Why does it break an external CSS? Any known bugs about this?

Greetings
Sebastian

P.S. I was talking about the page http://www.sspaeth.de . Remove the ;
in the common.js file and see the pop ups as well.

Try starting Mozilla.exe with -console, and WYSIWYW (What you see is

It would be nice to hear if there are other useful features hidden
behind unknown options...
Anybdy knows some? Is there a listing of them somewhere around?

I really wonder why people are asking this all the time? I personally
think is not so difficult to find and View->Sidebar(checked/unchecked)
is pretty intuitive, isn't it?

Maybe in customize sidebar there should be an additional
hide_sidebar_completely button which does the same as unchecking
view->Sidebar.

Will Chatzilla be back in the nights? When?

That would be my doing.  The old way was not modular and if you wanted to
add a new command line switch, you had to
hack nsAppRunner.cpp

I re-wrote it to use XPCOM categories and the nsICmdLineHander interface.

Yes.

Yes.  All you have to do is implement the nsICmdLineHandler interface and
register with the category manager.

The good news, is this is easy to do from C++.

The CMDLINEHANDLER_IMPL macro that I wrote makes implementing the
nsICmdLineHandler interface a one line job.
(see nsICmdLineHandler.idl)  You basically pass it some arguments and it
does all the work.

To register with the category manager, you add
CMDLINEHANDLER_REGISTERPROC_DECLS to your class
declaration.  The CMDLINEHANDLER_IMPL  macro also implements the
RegisterProc()  and UnregisterProc() methods which
register / unregister the progid for your class with the category manager
under "command-line-argument-handlers"

to get "-edit" to work, look at:
nsEditorService.h (for CMDLINEHANDLER_REGISTERPROC_DECLS usage)
nsEditorService.cpp (for CMDLINEHANDLER_IMPL usage)
nsEditorRegistration.cpp (because editor uses a generic module, it is real
easy.  search for nsEditorService::RegisterProc and
nsEditorService::UnregisterProc in that file.)

I guess what I really need to do is write up proper documentation on the
nsICmdLineHandler interface, how to use the macros, and how nsAppRunner.cpp
works.

I've skipped over how "general.startup.*" prefs get registered, and how all
this relates to "-help", and why some command line arguments (the profile
ones, like -CreateProfile, -ProfileManager, etc) don't use this scheme
(yet).

It is also possible to implement all this in JS.  I plan on doing that for
-chat (to launch chatzilla).

I'll put all that (and more) in the documentation  I am writing.

The current version of the doc lives at
http://www.mozilla.org/docs/command-line-args.html

What's wrong (and has already been pointed out) is that it defeates the
purpose of the splash screen - which is to show something while the app is
being loaded up. It should have fast loadup time.

The other option is to have another (plain and fast-loading) mini-spash
while the fancy spash screen is loading :-)

Do you have MS Visual C++ installed? nmake comes packaged with that product.
Also with MSVC comes a file vcvars32.bat which you should run. It will add
the directory containing nmake (and some other exes) to your path. Then you
will be able to run nmake.

If you have don't have much experience in compiling C++ code, it might not
be a good idea to try to build mozilla.

You might like to try the built executables that mozilla.org makes
available. If you download that you don't need to compile anything. You can
straightaway run the program. There are links on http://www.mozilla.org.
You could download the latest nightly or the most recent milestone.

I need to loop through all available user profiles to display them in a dialog
box; hence, I need a way of being able to tell how many profiles there are, 
and what each is called.

I've noted that when I create a new profile, a registry entry is added, called
HKCU\Software\Netscape\Netscape Nav.\biff\users\NewUserName, as well as a 
similar one under HKEY_USERS.

Also, a subdirectory is created where various profile files reside.

I've noted when I delete a user, and if I choose the delete option to leave
the profile files intact, neither the registry entry nor the subdirectory for 
the profile are changed in any way, yet Netscape is aware that the user no 
longer exists.

By what mechanism does Netscape know what profiles exist, and what their 
names are?

Thanks!

Mozilla needs an Easter Egg. I recommend that if you hold click and left
click on the Mozilla animation in the upper right corner of the browser and
then drag it to the web address text box, MOZ will appear in the box. If you
then drag the icon in that text box to the Mozilla animation, ILLA will
apear in the box. Then if you press enter in the box, the easter egg will
start. It will first show a short movie of godzilla attacking tokyo then it
will show the credits of every person who worked on the Mozilla project and
what component they worked on (only coders and people who designed graphics,
etc...). If instead of hitting enter, you typed :MSPONG so the text bar said
MOZILLA:MSPONG, you would play the old fashion pong from the 70's. There
would only be one difference - instead of the pong ball, there would be Bill
Gates's head. Anyway, every good program needs a pong Easter Egg heh heh :)

-Just typing in MOZILLA wouldn't cut it. You would have to follow the steps
outlined.

My impression is that mozilla.org is trying to do more the "right thing",
so they won't call it beta until it's feature complete.  Netscape, in fact,
is technically not calling this a "beta", it's a "Preview Release".

You should take a look at the Calendar Mozilla project, Netscape's own
product line, which includes a server side Calendar/Schedule Server, as well
as the Eudora Planner.  Outlook's advantage to Corporate IT is that it is a
shell application as well as a fairly reasonable scheduler and average email
client.  It enables those with the patience to generate forms based/schedule
based applications not just simple individual and resource scheduling.

This isn't to put you off though.

Subject: *Preliminary Hydra* Update - Please CC any replies to me if you
want an immediate response

BTW - a hydra is a small sea faring creature that has long, stinging
tenticles that grab prey and feed it into the mouth. (It is related to the
polyp stage of a jellyfish). It is also a greek monster that had (surprise!)
huge tenticles and devoured helpless humans whole (I wonder where they got
the inspiration?). Anyway, I thought the tenticles of the hydra would be
analogous to the Hydra module grabbing data and organizing it. Anyway, that
is where I got the name from. Hopefully, this module won't  devour people.
It was visioned a couple of days ago. The reason over it is anger over the
fact that other communications software (such as Outlook) have small
organizers and there is nothing of that sort for Mozilla. I think between
this and Mail/news there will be no reason to use outlook anymore. Other
organizers could also be passed in functionality and stability since Mozilla
has something that makes code developed fast yet be very good- a huge base
of programmers!

If I said this is going to be better than lotus then excuse me. I mean
lotus's organizer (which is pretty difficult to use for the first time, and
has a pretty lame calendar). This organizer will have nice dividers and a
quick launch tab in the My Toolbar (to launch components). Any of this
information could possibly be changed as planning goes forward. (I guarantee
some will). It will use Mozilla's profile management for protection of data.

Some preliminary info:

The module will be an organizer that will eventually be fusable with
Mozilla. It will contain the following components:

A task list - IE what to do on certain days you can assign a range of days -
or make it long-term with no set date. You can also set a time. It will have
alarms, etc.

A calendar - Each day will contain a notes section, a view of tasks for
today (from the task list), and an appointment schedule. There will also be
a long-term notes section. It will also have the ability to keep track of
special dates, such as your anniversary - so your wife doesn't kill you (if
your married), your friend's birthday, and the all important selection
sunday for NCAA :) Possibly, it might conform to standards of group
scheduling over the internet - if not, it will be a standalone calendar.

General notes section - contains just general notes.

*ALL NOTES WILL BE HTML COMPATIBLE LIKE MAIL MESSAGES*

A scientific calculator - there comes a time when a calculator comes in
handy that's easily excessible. Maybe in the future it can be a graphing
calculator (Just kidding).

Other parts. Any ideas?

It will work with mail/news project contacts (address book).

Much like the rest of Mozilla, javascript on web pages would have access to
the objects within this project, but of course nothing could be sent to or
from the page without the user's OK and the user would know exactly what the
page wanted to do (there would be a nice summary). That would rule out
malicous code and would give pages that announced events (like computer
shows in your area) the ability to make a link that adds the event to your
calendar, add notes, etc.

The project is currently in the speculation phase and needs more people to
move into the planning phase. A project page would be given if some useful
planning/history of project/etc. documents could be developed. CVS access
would be given once the code is in such a state that it can be added to the
tree. BTW - this project is here to stay. Even if I leave the scene (which I
doubt) I will find someone else to take it over for me. It is earmarked for
Release 2 of Mozilla 5 (Mozilla 5.1?) so there is plenty of time to work on
it. Is there anyone who would like to get in on the ground floor? I have
already replied to a few emails that show interest in the project. This will
be a large component of Mozilla (especially if web scheduling standards are
followed) and requires many devoted people to get anywhere. If you're free
then we need you.

This project marks another step to make Mozilla have more features (and
still be less buggy).

BTW - I never have written any Mozilla code though I've looked at the
source. For the time being, I will just be the one that organizes, replies,
and holds this project together. I promise that I will read all the
information about hacking Mozilla - I'm a quick learner. Please rub any
knowledge you have off on me :)

No one can stop you doing it, and once you've done it you can offer it to
the module owner, if its acceptable then its accepted.  At a guess though I
think you should talk to the module owner, who that is I'm not sure.  You
need to go through the Modules Owner page on mozilla.org and make your best
guess.

Although this feels sort of elitist, there could be a second layer
authentication of proof of seriousness, i.e. those already allowed to check
in, those actively in mozilla.org whether contributing or not, and beta
users.

The Netscape beta will not mention bugzilla. The Help menu will have links
that take people to Netscape support pages which will have feedback links
and links to newsgroups on Netscape's servers.

Some Netscape customers will no doubt find bugzilla anyway, either from
wandering around mozilla.org (after being linked there from the license
page) or from press articles ("Look, Ma -- write your own bugs!"). We're
trying to find ways to deal with it (example: the new "unconfirmed" bug
status).

The command SET creates environment variables.  In this case they are used
by the makefiles to locate the source and build the correct version for your
platform.
The easiest way to get these SET commands done is in a batch file.

Here is an example from my own build

Okay,

I've downloaded the overwhelming amount of source code, set up a

I go to mozilla.org and look at the build instructions. Very vague. I
can't get past the first thing ;-) namely, this part:

Man, the documentation on this project is not what I would have
expected. There are terabytes of info about the organization, etc, but
nothing specific on how to build and develop.

Ummm I think, and I can easily be wrong, that if its initiated from the UI
(i.e the user clicked on File open), that you'll find that it gets initially
called in netscape.js

Subject: How can I

In the previous incarnation of netlib, there was a "gzip" encoding
capability so that the browser could read gzipped html files, and
"decode" (un-gzip) them before building a stream to send to the HTML
parser.  I need to do something very similar, but with a different
encoding of the file.

I can't find this capability anywhere in the new "netwerk" code.  Could
someone please point me in the right direction?  Where would I insert a
"decoder" into the data flow after  reading the file and before passing
the data to the HTML parser. (Heck, I can't even find where the browser
actually *reads* a file!  Sure, there is PR_Open, but where does that
get called when you give a file URL?)  I've spent several fruitless
hours trying to mine through lxr.mozilla.org. And documentation? HAH!
I've sure tried to find some useful docs.  If I've missed anything,
someone please clue me in.

TIA,
-Kurt

If you're really into collecting browsers I have the original pristine

Hi, has anyone got a build (win32 or linux for that matter) of mozilla
based on the oct 31 1998 code ?
I was curios to know how different is is from M14 and other recent
builds.
The screenshots on mozillazine have wet my apetite.
Was the code originally released called Netscape Classic?

Apologies if this lot is in an faq, if so can someone post it's url?

True Worksforme can be the most irritating response.  I've managed to 
install Flash in both Beonex and pure Mozilla (which are very nearly 
identical), on Win2K, I admit I haven't tried them on Win9x.   When you get 
a new version of Mozilla, NS6 or similar you should always clear out your 
Profile or create a new one.

I don't think there is a bug raised on it, you can try searching Bugzilla 
but my searches haven't come up with a problem with the Flash xpi.  On one 
installation I had a problem where Mozilla crashed after the Flash 
installation on navigating to the Flash home page.  After restarting the 
machine (some time later when I could be bothered), the browser and Flash 
worked happily.

For Windows the clicking on the .xpi should put up a dialog asking whether 
you want to install it.  After its finished you should get two files 
NPSWF32.dll and ShockwavePlugin.Class in the Plugin directory underneath 
your Mozilla installation.

No they should work off the relative directory and the services available.

Well .xpi is platform independant to the extent that its a cross platform 
interface.  The actual plugins tend to be processor and application specific.

If fairness had anything to do with software then Digital Research Inc 
would still exist and Gates would be paying it royalties.  :-)

If you ask Beonex on Beonex's user list then I'm sure you'd get a 
reply.  Of course one of those replies could be, 'can you do it yourself?' 
given that its a fairly mechanical process you just need the software to 
build the application and the distribution with the install.  Bear in mind 
that no one is going to make any revenue simply out of building a 
distribution and making it available so any costs have to be in contributed 
time.

That sounds like me :-) its something I've said on a few occasions.  The 
startup costs would be between 3 and 4 thousand pounds for me, let alone 
the time taken to understand the Mac sufficiently to get it to build and 
implement changes.  That when there is no appreciable market to get a 
return back on that investment just doesn't make it economic for me.  You 
need someone who already has at their disposal both the hardware and the 
software as well as the inclination and over the past three years Mac 
developers have been conspicuous only by their absence.

Scare up a willing developer or find someone interested in investing 
development capital and you will get somewhere, berating distributors and 
developers who don't have the wherewithal to meet your particular needs 
though won't get you anywhere at all.

Are you kidding? I've been using various "milestones" of Mozilla and
at it's current state it is unusable. I think it shouldn't be 
recommended to somebody already fed up with Netscape crashing. Mozilla
crashes about every 15 minutes, when Netscape crashes "only" once or
twice a day. I wish all good luck for Mozilla developers, but I see 
no way it would be considerable browser in near future.

No, I haven't. The problem is that there isn't any clear situation when
Mozilla crashes. I see no point on reporting a bug, when I don't have
any idea what activated it or how it could be reproduced. 

I perhaps came on too negative on Mozilla. I do have high hopes for it,
but currently it's quite unstable, at least on Linux. Unfortunetely I 
don't have chance to try it out on Windows. 

Of course Mozilla doesn't have to be stable when being some kind of
pre-beta release, but it shouldn't either be recommended to somebody
who already is annoyed with Netscape crashing. I think that won't bring
any good publicity.

handshake for each TCP connection being set up for getting the HTML as 
well as the embedded gifs etc

Though HTTP 1.1 provides some respite as it supports persistent connections 
and pipelining. We would still like it to take bit further and figure
out a solution which is more bandwidth effective and provides faster access.

We would appreciate if anybody can provide more information or pointers 
in this direction....

It looks like ::DebugBreak() is meant to throw you into the debugger
rather than terminate the app on things like assertions (see prlog.c)
rather than call abort(). Where might this be implemented (or is it dead
code)? Thanks.

Im administering a network of 15 O2's, they are set-up almost
identically, but..

I have a webpage with educational material for my students
http://hal9000.ots.dk/animation/
it is using a stylesheet I made wich is referring fonts in absolute
pixel sizes.

This pages renders fine on all but one of the O2's, this one machine
renders the content of the table extremely/unreadably small.
I have tried running netscape with remote display to another station and
also another stations netscape displaying on the problem station, and it
is clear that it is not a Netscape problem but rather a X/Wm problem
since it is only when displaying the content on that machine that things
go wrong.

I have tried pretty much reinstalling all system components, and copied
all files that would seem to be related from a working station, but
still .. it renders the text small.

Do anyone have an idea where to look?

Hi folks,

I am a dialuppie, and it's sunday. This means that I can *NOT* download
more than a few k's in a row.

I use news.mozilla.org to address this newsgroup, but actually they seem
to be behaving like an archive or something. The first messages that I
was able to look at dated from 1998 - about the start of the Mozilla
project. This particular newsgroup currently contains 16164 messages
(and I haven't been able to check their age).

My complaint is that I can't use news.mozilla.org at all because I first
have to download all the old and obsolete messages -- and I can not do
that. It's just too much, my browser fails or keeps trying in vain.

Now all you backbone-trippin' hardcore folks point to me and laugh at
the dialuppie >:-D -- OK, ready? The fact is, that I am not the only
dialuppie (noO0? no!) and that news.mozilla.org is unusable for me this
way (besides it takes extra disk space and bandwith for everyone).

So I wondered if someone could do something about that, or whatever.

Greets,

Stefan

P.S.: Don't hesitate to get personal and send your replies to my very
own email address -- I doubt if I can read it in the newsgroups (even on
a non-sunday :-).

Nop still only the second alpha version out there. But they say it will come

I have a mystic problem within the messenger.
The following problem occured within several versions of netscape 4.7x
on Win95 or WinNT 4.

When i click on "Answer", the "New message"-Window opens correctly WITH
the quoted original-text (most times).

With SOME incoming mails, that doesn't work - If I answer one of these
messages, no quote is viewed. But the function "Forward as quote" workes
correctly !!!
This original-mails (which are not quoteable by "Answer"-function) are
send by a html-formula (I am able to change this formula, if neccessary)
... perhaps the effect is caused by one of the head-lines ?

What can I do ? PLEASE HELP !

Here is an example of the headlines:

Hi All
Not wanting to double post but in the seamonkey news group, this server,
got told to go to AOL, but would like to know if anyone here can answer the
question below.

Does anyone know when or if the Netcenter Apps will be added back
into the customize menu in My Sidebar?

In the official M 13 alpha (Build 2000012520) release it was there and
seemed to work correctly, in M 14(build 2000022808) it was also there but by clicking
on Check Mail got you only to the My Netcenter start page and not to the login for post.
Bug #29817 and #28069
Using build 2000031008 at the moment and no sign of Netcenter Apps.

Hi
I confirm that Mozilla seems to have problems with frames. On some pages that
I have there are the same false displays. As an example simply go to www.netradio.com,
click on a channel for music, then click on listen in RealAudio, don't pick the Windows
Media Player, Mozilla will crash everytime. Take a look at the controls ect and do the same
in either NS 4X or IE 5X and compare and oh one more thing in either of the two browsers
it's okay to click on the media player if you like.

Anyone here been keeping up with Novell's DigitalMe site 
(www.digitalme.com)? I want to bounce this idea off you, just to get a 
feel for whether this is a possible project:

Background:
For those of you that aware of DigitalMe, the idea of the DM is to 
provide a secure online repository for your passwords and bookmarks. It 
also allows you to give a pointer to your directory information to other 
users (placing you in their address book). The idea is that when you 
update your contact information, the changes are visible to everyone 
that has access to your directory entry. Potentially, you could choose 
to share your directory information with e-commerce firms, so that you 
wouldn't have to fill in all those forms when you want to buy something.

Proposal:
What if the Mozilla address book and password store was redirected into 
Digitalme? That way, you would have an integrated always-up-to-date 
address book, and your passwords would be available on every Mozilla 
browser configured like this. (Probably most popular in school 
'net-cafe' type situations).

Why do this:
Honestly, I think Mozilla will be a great browser - the browser of 
choice on non-Microsoft machines. But it's going to need something extra 
to make a breakthrough into the Windows PC market.  As for Novell, their 
new ecommerce initative (the biz to user side) is reliant on DM, which 
hasn't yet become very popular. They need something to increase interest 
so that they can provide a real alternative to MS's Passport program. 
Creating this alternative through Mozilla would allow AOL to be 
involved, giving it a greater chance at success. And AOL and Novell 
already have official relations regarding DM, though the Instant 
Messenger program, so recieving 'official approval' doesn't seem that 
difficult.

I know we need to get a stable browser shipped first - I try to help by 
chasing bugs, but I'd like to hear your opinions about this.  If there's 
sufficient interest, I may try to do a proof-of-concept implementation, 
based solely on redirectors. (Can't afford VC right now to do it 
/right/, so I'm doing everything in Borland, which I haven't been able 
to get to complile Moz). If there's no interest, tell me so I won't 
waste my time.  If you think it's a cool idea, let me know too, so I can 
pursue this further.

Best regards,
-Steve Bishop

In Netscape 4.x, they handled it with some locally stored JavaScript, 
accessible through some bookmarks. In IE, they did it with three DLLs 
and a 'browser bar'.

Transactions between your PC and DM are handled through https (you must 
authenicate to DM before using it...this is done with one of the 
bookmarks), the information 'vault' encrypts key information (like 
passwords), other data just gets access control via Directory Services.

Have you tried this in mozilla? It should work, though I'm not sure
if there are any bugs in it.

  End-users of Netscape products should continue to use the current Netscape
support channels (help.netscape.com and the communicator newsgroups). If Netscape
wants to create new newsgroups for netscape 6, then, great.
  Mozilla developers should continue using these groups. The netscape.public.dev.*
heirarchy should be used for developers wanting to build off of the web
standards that happen to be supported by mozilla/Netscape 6. The 
  I don't see how this should change any charters. It may make the offtopic
problem slightly worse, though.

Are you looking to build mozilla yourself? If so go to Download/Build 
on this page:
http://www.mozilla.org/source.html

If you are looking to use pre-built binaries:
http://www.mozilla.org/binaries.html
tar zxvf blah.tar.gz;
cd blah; ./mozilla;

How the heck do you load Mozilla from an icon in KDE? I got the latest
beta, but I can only seem to do it from teh command prompt. . . and that
is only after I type:

cd /usr/local/bin/mozilla/package/
./mozilla

I can't seem to do it from ALT-F2 either. Anyone ever figure out how to
do this? I am relatively knew to KDE (but learning more everyday, it is
my primary operating system now).

Any help would be appreciated.

I am trying to view a website that needs Shockwave. I find that the
website works if I run netscape as root. When I try to run as steveo
it fails. I even renamed my ~/.netscape out of the way and let
netscape create a whole new one from scratch.

When I run Help -> About Plugins I get the following display:

                            Shockwave Flash

    File name: /usr/lib/netscape/plugins/npflash.so

               Shockwave Flash      swf                  No

When I run as root, all the yes's are lit right up.

I checked all the permissions on all the files and there is no
problem. I even ran netscape from strace to see if there were any
system calls that failed because of inadequate file permission
problems. No dice. 

I also experimented with a contrib version of flash vs. the static
version that comes from the NS download. The static version learly
worked better.

If anyone is interested, the site I'm try to view (as steveo) is
http://www.e-kong.com/

I'm really intruiged at getting this thing working. If anyone has any
advise to try, I'd be grateful. Please email as news is much harder
for me right now than it will be in about a month.

Many many TIA.

When I load my mrtg page the graphics look really bad compared to NS

I'm using the latest nightly build, but it's been like this for a while.

I'm no programmer so I can't give any constructive feedback, but I hope
this'll be fixed sometime ;)

Thanks.

The "weird", if I could call that, thing is that output from Webalizer
(www.mrunix.net/webalizer/) looks ok. It too uses png.

Whatever happened to the ultra cool scrollbar ??
All I see now is a GTK scrollbar and it's...well...kind of...boring ;)

Well... anyway.. thanks for the good work !

On that sort of a note -- what actually *are* the criteria for beta1
bugs at this point? Is "a clear bug with a very easy resolution that is
pretty certain not to break anything, and causes problems on some sites"
enough to make a bug beta1, even if there aren't many such sites?

For example, one bug that affects a page I visit frequently is
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=25330 (The summary of this
bug is misleading; read the comments for the real bug). I wouldn't say
that this bug is particularly serious, in that it only seems to affect a
small minority of pages, but it also seems to be very easy to fix (in
fact, I believe the code was already there but over-enthusiastically
removed in order to fix
http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=23376). It also is likely to
be very frustrating to users and developers who do happen to encounter
it, just because it does seem to be so easy to get right.

So my question is... should I submit this for consideration for beta1?
For beta2? What criteria should I apply to determine whether something
should be considered for beta?

Thanks,
Stuart.

I would still suggest making a change to the wording. How about
something like:

----
"This may indicate that the site does not comply with W3C industry
standards and therefore  may not work perfectly with Mozilla."
----
or maybe something more detailed and brutal like:
----
"This may indicate that the site is written to work only with specific
browsers, and should be updated to support Mozilla (or better yet to
support the W3C industry standards which will work with other browsers
too)."
----

I agree with the original poster that implying that pages need to be
"updated for mozilla" positions mozilla as if it were intentionally
breaking everyone's pages, when in fact the exact opposite is true - the
pages are intentionally breaking non NS4/IE browsers.

Presumably just changing the text of the message would be legal even
under stringent checkin rules.

I like the idea of using a popup for javascript errors; with the
existing NS4 implementation they are too easy to miss.

Any thoughts?
Stuart.

I hope I'm getting the wrong impression here... but are you saying that
Netscape will be shipping Netscape 5.0 beta 1 with no support for SSL?

Actually I *believe* there's actually a startup option in mozilla (at
least the debug builds, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's in all of
them) called *something like* -f, which will load a list of urls in the
format:
http://first.url.here/
http://second.url.here/

And browse to each of them. It's used for testing and QA so that it's
possible to set off an automated test suite.

Try running "mozilla -f myfile.txt" (sorry, don't have a mozilla around
atm to test this).

If you need a delay between visiting the sites, you may have to add that
code yourself.

HTH,
Stuart.

I love the fact that the NPL license header is in the source of this :)
Will that be there when you view source on about:mozilla?

OTOH, the actual html in that file is kinda sucky... would a patch to
update it to xhtml 1.0 be accepted? ;)

I just downloaded the tarball and installed it in the /usr/lib/mozilla
directory created by my Debian mozilla installation. I blew away
~/.mozilla/component.reg as requested (this is what corresponds to the
package/component.reg file in a "standard" moz install) and ran mozilla
-chrome chrome://xmlterm/default/xmlterm.xul (The "xmlterm" binary
wouldn't work for various other reasons).

I got the following messages on startup (the error is, of course, at the
end...)

I am running Debian Woody (up to date as of this morning) and my mozilla
package is version M14-1 (Build ID: 2000030321).

Is there any fix for this other than downloading a "stock" mozilla? (I
like the debian packages because they take care of what should be in
~/.mozilla and what should be in /usr/lib/mozilla for me... but I'd
really, really like to get xmlterm to work. It looks SO cool.)

Thanks in advance for any help. Followups set to .general because that's
where I read.

Stuart.

See http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=30822 and its associated
test-case page. Linking to a data: stylesheet url works, but the image
does not show up.

AFAIK, this bug has everything that anyone knows about this issue.

Subject: show toolbars as icons only in userChrome.css?

I can probably figure this out for myself if I investigate hard enough
but I'm posting first because I'm sure that somebody has done this
before me and can just tell me the way to do it.

I assume there is something you can put in your userChrome.css file that
will set display:none on the text labels underneath all the toolbar
buttons in the classic theme (thereby providing the equivalent of 4.x's
"show toolbars as icons only" pref item). Does anyone happen to know
what this magic line is?

Thanks,
Stuart.

Hi everyone,
    Here is my simple question: what is the time zone of the "modified date"
of files in the Mozilla ftp site (ftp.mozilla.org), particularly those
located in the /pub/mozilla/nightly/latest/ folder (I'm really interested in
the mozilla-win32-installer.exe)? I need to know in order to configure my
scheduled download properly. I doubt a lot whether the dates I see via
CuteFTP Pro are already translated to my time zone. I just want to be able
to get the latest builds as soon as they are made.

Kal, the Mozilla addict

Hello,
I was wondering if it is possible to script things like accepting
cookies, urls, highlighting certain text in mailer, news groups, etc.

Basically I would like to have control to what sites are accessible from
the browser, etc.

I would really appreciate your help.

Ravi

I have installed M14 per  the instructions but upon starting mozilla
(./mozilla) it eventually hangs @  "WEBSHELL+ =1".  It won't proceed any
further and I have to kill off the term window.  I was able to run M13
just fine.  Don't understand what the hangup is.  I have tried deleting
the registry and even deleting the /.mozilla directory but to no avail.
Any suggestions would be appreciated. [FYI I am using an updated RH6.0
w/glibc2.x]  TIA

No not exactly but thank you for the suggestion. I think I may just wait for
the N6 beta release.  BTW I noticed that the Mozilla splash screen wasn't
loading either..................wonder why.

Is the intent to have good Java support in either of the first
'real' releases for these products?  What about on the Linux
platform?

I understand that Java 2 will be bundled on forthcoming AOL CDs,
will Mozilla/Communicator be there as well, even if not the as
the default browser?

Thanks,

Terry

Because then I would get whining of "gee, I'm using up all my votes on
this bug, and it's not having any different effect than it would if I
had used only one!"

I can't win.

Probably not a bad idea, though implementing it is kind of a pain. 
(Well, to be more specific, implementing the current column was a pain
and a hack, and I'd have to double the pain to get the other column.)

Yes, this is all true.  I have submitted a bug against myself to this
effect:

    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=31180

I will happily take a look at any text that anyone wants to submit for
this!

Howdy, all.  I was using M14 and went to today's daily build, to find
that the look of the sidebar had changed.  Instead of the blue bars,
it's now a set of folder tabs.  Maybe it'll look better once color's
been added, but the blue-bar look (the one m14 used) for the sidebar
looks, well, classier. It's simple and elegant.  Just my 2 cents.

Howdy, all.
I was previously using M13 and M14, then decided to try out the nightly
builds.  Grabbed todays (3/31), and noticed that the sidebar had
changed.  Instead of the blue bars, it now has black& white folder
tabs.  Maybe color will change it, but IMHO the blue bars looked
classier, more elegant, simpler.  Just my 2 cents.

I'm using the 3/27 build and tried to install the personal
security manager (PSM) pointed to at the Mozilla site.  But
the installation seems to fail after the downloading completes:
XPInstall Results
PSM: Error encountered -- -235

When I look at the psm.exe that got installed, Windows tells me
that it's not a valid Windows application.  Does anyone have a
clue?

Thanks,

Thanks Hallie!  Removing the folder/retrying did the trick...
Now if Mozilla were able to handle the HTML www.datek.com
uses for its login, I could start making it my daily browser :-)

For about a month now, I've been downloading nightlies
hoping that the problems would go away, but it hasn't.
So before I file a bug report, I figure I'll ask here
whether anyone else has these two problems:

- whenever I first bring up the mail/news window, the
left pane is unusably narrow.  I always have to resize
it!

- After resizing the pane, the various folders and
newsgroups don't get painted - I have to "shrink" and
then "expand" again via the folder arrow.

Has anyone else observed this and, if so, is there already
a bug report for it?

Thanks,
Tom

My environment: The message/newsgroup window uses the
second layout (i.e. two panes on top, the message pane on
the bottom); I'm using the "Modern" skin (although I have
observed this with "Classic" as well.)  The latest nightly
that I have tried is the 10/24 one.
I'm running Windows NT 4.0 on 256MB Dell with an NVIDIA
GeForce 256 w/32 MB VRAM.

Hello everyone,

first of all: I've noticed the progress Mozilla has made the last few weeks.
MTBF has greatly improved, congratulations for that!
But still... 
Most of you will have machines with quite quick processors such als
Celerons 400 up to Athlons and PIIIs.
I´m one of the not so few (I guess) which have older, slower processor
speed, a pentium 133 in my case with W95 OSR2.
On this machine with 98 meg RAM mozilla is MUCH slower than 4.7.
Slower in a way that makes it close to being unusable.
UI responsiveness and window startup and change time are quite bad.

Sorry, but you should be aware that there are still a lot of slower
machines out there. What is the benefit from a small footprint if
Mozilla is soooo slow...

Dan,

it´s good to know that you folks are aware of the problem.

For me, als long as the menus don´t feel nearly as quick as
native menus, working with mozilla requires SOME patience
and good will. The other posts are correct, it´s not 
rendering that is the problem but creating new windows
and the menus. I guess that is mainly because you don´t
use native widgets for the menus but XUL but I can´t 
figure out why startup times (app and new items) are so
big.
>From my perspective rendering speed is a good marketing
argument but users will only be converted when responsiveness
improves significantly.
Again: I know we´re only advancing beta and it´s too early to
complain, but things should be noted.

Anyway, you do a very good job, keep up with that!

Thorsten

Hi,

one thing that disturbs me about Mozilla: While the document is being
loaded, you can't click reload - you always have to click "stop" and
then reload.

For example, if I notice during loading that the document that's
currently being loaded is old (from proxy), I simply used to click on
"reload" with Communicator. Now, I have to hit two buttons to reach the
same goal.

Of course this is not a bug report, that's just a suggestion for an
improvement :)

Related build: Linux M14 2000022916

bye,
 Tillmann

After downloading and installing the binaries for Mozilla on my Linux 
Mandrake 7.2 box, I tried running the program in a shell only to get after 
the registering of plugins the following line;


/usr/local/mozilla/run-mozilla.sh: line 72: 31237 Illegal instruction  
$prog ${1+"$@"}

All the above is one line. Then it quits back to the prompt. Anybody seen 
this before? I have Netscape 6 installed and it works fine, as well as 
Opera and my system is pretty much stock with no hacking done to it on my 
part. Any suggestions would be appreciated!

Thanks

Just a question, but does anyone have any idea what the size would be if 
all of a sudden someone decided Mozilla was ready for release tomorrow. 
  Take out everything that's there for test purposes and how big is it 
actually.  I'm just wondering because download time makes a big 
difference in if someone on a 56k will download the product or not.

If you look at the Winamp skins.  It's just a picture that goes over a 
default space.  It's also just 3 windows.  Doing that works fine if all 
you have is 3 windows.  3 small windows can be morphed into whatever you 
want with 20 or so jpegs and gifs, but if you go through Mozilla there's 
much more than just 3 windows.  It would be crazy to do skins that way. 
  Mozilla has to do it in a way that just a few little graphics can be 
spread everywhere in the app and have it still work fine.

Could someone explain to me how to post to the secure server for 
netscape using M14. The server I have set up is secnews.netscape.com 
with the SSL option checked. The news group is netscape.communicator. 
This is the same set up I run in Communicator 4.72. When I try to read 
the newsgroup it gives me the error message:

A News (NNTP) error occurred:No such group.

Thanks for your help.

Tim

Thanks for the link. Still no go. I first deleted all the prior M14 
milestone files I had. I then downloaded the program 
http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla/releases/m14/mozilla-win32-M14-Crypto-talkback.zip 
and unzipped it. I ran mozilla.exe. On the bottom right hand corner it 
says build ID 2000030317 and there is an open lock symbol which wasn't 
there before. I went back to the site and clicked on the bar at the 
bottom of the page that says "Install Netscape PSM for Windows". A 
download window opened and after awhile I got a message saying it 
installed. I do not remember the exact message. XPinstall successful or 
something like that. I exited Mozilla and rebooted the system. No luck 
here so I guess it doesn't work for me. Oh well. Netscape still works. :)

5 seconds from clicking Reply to being able to compose the message using
the latest nightly (downloaded this morning) on a Pentium 233 w/ 128MB
Ram. The nightly I downloaded on December 21 had a similar response
time. Is this something that will improve or is my machine just too slow
to run Moz/Netscape6?

I'm trying to download mail folders for offline storage.  When
using a pop server, this doesn't seem to be a problem - there's
an ascii file corresponding to the mail folder.  However, when
using imap (and the system in question does not support pop), I'm unable
to figure out where the relevant ascii files for folders downloaded
for offline viewing are located.  Can someone help?

Thanks!

Hello all,

I just built M14  and I'm finding that when I resize the window the page
that is being displayed is not resized along with it. Did I do something
wrong when I built it? Any help would be greatly appreciated?


Thanks,

Hi,
When you don't have the "Send email address as anonymous FTP password"
box checked in Preferences/Advanced, what gets sent as the userid and
password? Is the word "anonymous" sent as both?
Thanks,

Why should it need to show HTML?? It's prolly just some idiot at m$ who thought
it would be cool to send HTML pages to his buddies and see them. It's just waist
of time to load them and how f**king fun is it  to get cockies on a server which
only purpors is to put you on junkmaillists (it's damn sad you can't tell which
server never has the right to use cockies in NS/M). How damn fun is it when you
are offline rading your mails and the "callup" window popups when you are gona
to delete that advertisment you in first place didn't want to get down from your
pop3 server in the first place.

If I had an extra monitor I prolly would have used YAM as mailer and AWeb as my
browser as they seems to have those small things which people miss in pc
mailers/browsers.

I am new to this Mozilla stuff and, in fact, had my first look at
Mozilla.org only about a couple of days back. I've gone ahead and downloaded
ActivePerl, the GNU tools, etc. that are needed for building the lizard.....

Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be too much of source code
documentation and, since I am only used to the VC++ compiler, I am having
trouble navigating the source code (no Class View, File View, etc.) I
haven't decided in which area I'll contribute to the project. Thought I had
better have a look at the stuff before I figure out where my skills lie and
what I can do.....

Could someone give me pointers on how to start navigating the source code?

I hope I am in the right newsgroup.

I am using
Netscape 6 Preview Release 3
Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Win98; en-US; m18) Gecko/20000929 Netscape6/6.0b3 

Everytime I start a Netscape session, the bookmarks import the IE
favorites folder. I dont want that; right now I manually delete the
folder.

Can anyone tell me how to stop Netscape from loading the Favourites folder?
Thanks!!

This sounds like a bug, and as I didn't see it existing already, I just
filed it.

::DebugBreak is a standard Win32 function.  See its
documentation on Microsoft's developer site:

Hi,

According to RFC2109,  Set-Cookie header has a cookie-av named Max-Age.
I have found that both IE and Netscape don't support it by looking at 
the prompt for cookie for IE and
cookie manager for Netscape.  Instead, both of them supports the 
Netscape's original proposal 'Expires' cookie-av instead.  Does anybody 
know why and when will they support this?
or they already do?  

Best regards,
Warut

Yes, but it is a totally different CPU with a completely different instruction
set.  Alpha and intel executables are not even remotely compatible.  That's
what the "platform" means.  Alpha is a different platform from intel. 

You cannot possibly install a software package on alpha unless: 1) alpha
executables are included in the package, or b) the FX binary
emulator/translator can convert the executables from intel to alpha.

I don't run NT on alpha any more (or nt at all, for that matter), but it was
always my experience that FX was very limited in what it would translate. 
Almost every package I tried to install contained some type of custom device
driver, and FX does not even attempt to translate those.


That said, I seem to recall that FX had its own setup program.  You might try
that instead of the setup that comes with the software package.  It's somewhere
in the fx directory tree.

I read their technical FAQ, but I still haven't figured out:

how they can do single-sign-on with no browser modifications
whether they store my passwords on their server
whether DigitalMe is at least as secure as the exisiting Web
infrastructure (I certainly wouldn't want to use it if it's less secure)

Hi all!

I put together a batch script that will:

- Download the Win32 (ZIP) Mozilla build automatically
- Remove the current Mozilla build
- Install the newly downloaded Mozilla

It's available at:   http://dormcam.webhop.net/mozupd.zip


A few notes:
This script is pretty simple, and makes some assumptions:
The script is installed in:   C:\MOZUPD
Mozillia is installed in:      C:\PROGRAM FILES\NETSCAPE\SEAMONKEY
You'll want to probably double check the .BAT and .SCR file to make sure it'll 
work on your system properly    (if you use directory locations other than the 
above)

Using the Windows System Agent, I set up this script to run early every 
morning, so every day when I use my computer, I have the latest Mozilla build 
already installed and ready to go!

Happy Testing!!
-WD

Hello,

    I am wondering if anyone knows how to force ie5 and Netscape 4.72 to
display excel files in another window instead of within the same window as
they currently do!  I have created a window with 5 frames within it.  One of
the windows has a link in it that goes to a tab delimited file on the sever
that is named myFile.xls, for example.  In the older versions of Netscape,
if you clicked on the link, Netscape would spawn excel as a totally
different process in it's own excel window.  With ie5 and Netscape 4.72
however, excel always opens in the frame that had the link within it.  It
however has none of the controls such as reformat the cells, autofit the
cells, etc.  The browser window that contains the frames does not have any
buttons on it either whatsoever such as back, forward, etc. because we need
to control what the user does in order to keep them from getting the
application into an inconsistent state.  I have complete control of the web
server, so I can change the mime type associations, etc. if I need to, but I
need a solution that works whether the client is using win95, 98, or nt4.0.
The web server is Apache 1.3.4 and IIs and is running on NT4.0.  Any help
would be greatly appreciated.

                                Sincerely,
                                  Leroy

	Is the actual Mozilla CVS repository, not just the tip files, available
directly?  In other words, can I get access to the ,v files somehow?  Is
their a CVSup server available?  Thanks for your help!

does mozilla support external js files? (i.e. <script

after crashing 2000030508 with a more complicated js file (using
document.write inside a .js. i think the document.write("<script
SRC='xyz.js'></script>") caused the crash, not sure though) i created a
simple case with
<a href="JavaScript:doIt()" onMouseOver="statusMessage('test');return
true" onMouseOut="statusMessage('')"> (function test() and function
statusMessage(message) are in the js) showed JavaScript:doIt() in the
status bar and onClick nothing happend at all.

what are the limitations when using js files?
are these problems going to be solved or is this a 'not working because
it's not W3C compliant' situation?
(or is my javascript messed up? these are my first tests in javascript
and only because it works in NN and IE doesn't neceserally mean it's
good javascript)

thanks for your feedback

Please note: cross posted to xpfe, ui & general

There's a lot of traffic on ui & xpfe about skins

as we approach beta and then every tom dick and larry decides they want
to make skins
for mozilla the signal to noise ratio will climb in these group as has
already been mentioned.

what do people think.?
