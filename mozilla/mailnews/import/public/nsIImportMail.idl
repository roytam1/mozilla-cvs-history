/*

  Interface for importing mail - ui provided by the import module.  If
  you wish to provide your own UI then implement the nsIImportGeneric
  interface.

*/

/*
	If you support this interface then the standard mailbox import UI
	can be used to drive your import of mailboxes, which means you don't have
	to worry about anything other than implementing this interface 
	(and nsIImportModule) to import mailboxes.
*/

/*
	The general process is:
	1) Do you know where the mail is located
	2) Do you want the user to "verify" this location and have
	the option of specifying a different mail directory?
	3) Given a directory (either specified in 1 or 2) build a list
	of all of the mailboxes to be imported.
	4) Import each mail box to the destination provided!
	5) Update the portion of the mailbox imported so far.  This should
	always be less than the mailbox size until you are done.  This
	is used for progress bar updating and MAY BE CALLED FROM ANOTHER
	THREAD!
