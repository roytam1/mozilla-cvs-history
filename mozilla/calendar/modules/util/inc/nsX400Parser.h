/**
 * This class was needed for logging into the CS&T calendar server. 
 * It manages a string in the following form:
 *
 *    /S=Steve/G=Mansour/Nd=10000/
 *
 * It breaks up the string into its property name and value pairs
 * and allows easy access to individual properties.
 * My assumption here is that there won't be too many properties.
 * The class is initialized to deal with 50. That should be more than
 * adequate. It can deal with more automatically if it must.
 *
 * This code probably exists somewhere else.
