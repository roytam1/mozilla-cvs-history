<p><b>The Goal:</b> 
The Mozilla Calendar project is meant to create an open source, standards based calendar solution.  The initial codebase is being donated by <a href="http://www.oeone.com">OEone Corporation</a> and should be thought of only as a demonstration of what can be accomplished using XUL, JS, CSS and XPCOM.
<p>
The first thing that we would like to accomplish is to define a set of requirements.  What do you want the calendar to do? The place to voice your opinion is in the <a href="news://news.mozilla.org/netscape.public.mozilla.calendar">Calendar Newsgroup</a>. Once all the requirements have been established, we will go about designing the calendar.
<p>
The sample code from OEone is available online, as well as instructions on how to build it. Here's a screenshot for you.  Presently the code only runs under Linux, with plans in the works to quickly convert the code to run uner Windows and Mac.
<p>
<b>How You Can Help:</b>
<ul>
    <li>Get Involved / Share Ideas:  The people in the calendar project hand out on #calendar on irc.mozilla.org. We also read the newsgroup regularly. 
    <li>Write Code: We need people who know how to program in XUL, CSS, JavaScript or C++. If you've never tried XUL, you'll find out how easy it is by reading the programmers guide here at Mozilla.org, or by reading the tutorial at XulPlanet.com.
</ul>
