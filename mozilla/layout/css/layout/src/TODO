todo for AOL August 1st deadline:
---------------------------------

o bug17-3.html: when dealing with incremental frame-appended reflow we
  need to know how the last clean line was ended (e.g. break, clear=all, etc.)
  otherwise we won't adjust the y coordinate properly. We can save the
  break status into the line or adjust the line height and make it tall.
  
o entities in attributes (e.g. alt text at disney.com)

o tuning ideas:
  o DidReflow N^2 [current disabled because of nested view x,y problem]
  o FindTextRuns N^2
  o LineData allocations/frees

o click on gif, jpg, txt

o http://www.aol.com/netfind
  o fix the size of the iframe
  o look into the parsing bug's

o http://www.magicbit.com/links/travel.htm; why is the SMART-NET image
  at the bottom instead of at the baseline?

o http://www.altavista.com looks wrong. why?
  why does it go into an infinite loop during a -f run?

o bug2.html

o UMR bug because of painting during reflow


o fast scroll to #ref for a link targeted at the same document as is
  currently showing

o force-refresh needs to get the nsIScrollableView and update that view,
  not the root view

o f:/html/bug8.html (descent bug in vertically align children)

o Viewer:
  o make the print-preview menu item work
  o select-all and copy menu items
  o fix link-over status

o fix floating tables
  x current-line floaters need to go in previous line's bcl list; if first line
    then they go in the block-frame's pending floater list
  x <block><floater>... we need a place to hang current-line floaters!!!
  x http://www.news.com
  x http://www.usatoday.com/ 
  o http://www.mrshowbiz.com/
  x file:/f:/html/floating-images.html
	"tucked between the woofers" isn't
  o file:/f:/html/floating-tables-inline.html
	overwrite errors
  o file:/f:/html/br-clear.html
	3rd test case is not compatible with navigator; I think navigator
	has a bug IMHO.

o block-frame: DidReflow and content-appended can be smarter; right now
  we did-reflow the whole caboodle whereas we could keep a bit in the
  line that indicates where the dirty lines were so that when the
  block's parent comes along and does a did-reflow it can propogate it
  down to only the affected lines.

o fix blocks inside of inlines; need to find the block's inline-layout
  state and see where the block child is with respect to the left edge
  of the line.

o mark/insert-at-mark for parser???

o www.cnn.com: crash

o performance:
  o people.netscape.com

o slide show resize bug

o fix assertion on LCIC in nscssblockframe::content-inserted when
  running rotate.html/js test

o docloader needs to disconnect itself as an observer when it's done

----------------------------------------------------------------------
After august 10th
----------------------------------------------------------------------

o why is nsInlineLayout different from nsInlineReflowState (mott@nc.com)

BASE TAG SUPPORT:
o revise the way that base tags work (somehow); either make the
  content sink aware of all tags that can have url's in them, or better
  yet, add in base tag api's to the nsHTMLDocument and make the content
  set-attribute methods deal with it; or add in a method to
  nsIHTMLContent called SetBaseURL and SetTarget (which is defined to be
  ignored except for those tags that care)

  o implement base tag support:
    o frame, iframe, frameset
    o layer
    o Body (background), TABLE, TR, TD (background), etc.
    o Image, Anchor; look at html4.0 spec for attributes that are URI's

  o TEST base tag support:
    o script src=
    o style src=

o NS_FRAME_FIRST_REFLOW needs to go; block code is the only consumer
  instead keep a list of new frames and when we hit one, trigger the
  initial reflow

o Query-Interface day: go through and change all the QueryInterface
  implementations to put the cast into a temp variable and then cast the
  temp variable to void*

o crash in: http://www-dsed.llnl.gov/documents/a_document.html
  the problem stems from a OL marked display:inline that contains LI's;
  the LI's aren't doing the right thing to find the container that
  has next ordinal number (which in this case is none!)

o implement hspace, vspace; test for navigator compatability
  check for all other unimplemented tag attributes
  verify that DumpContent works; write a oneof.html test that has every
  tag with every attribute in every combination in it.

o max-element-size and floaters:
  the correct value is dependent on which table pass we are in;
  for pass1 we really only need the max(floaters, child-max-element-size)
  for pass2 we need a per-line max-element-size and then we need to
  compute the sum(floaters, line-max-element-size); this is still not
  quite right; the sum should be the sum of the floaters and the line's
  first-element-size.

o ebina margin bugs:
  BR tags
  line-height adjustment (sometimes; see test0.html and the large font)
  P's in LI's
  f:/html/bug3.html (yikes!)
  f:/html/bug6.html 
  www.infoseek.com; see steve's mail (date july 21st)
  www.w3.org
  f:/html/image-hspace.html

o rework how BR's work:
  f:/html/image-vspace.html; notice the top two lines stuck together in nav
  make clear-line a real style-const property and use it to mean "give me
  a fresh line". Then make br's zero height. Have the block code handle the
  fresh line concept directly...work this in with keeping track of pending
  vertical whitespace for table shrink wrapping.

o ebina's engine provides automatic margins around floating images that
  are PROPORTIONAL to the size of the image's border (find the code
  luke)

o tinderbox: add selftest to our makefile so that it will run whatever
  we want and verify the results of a build

o XXX code in block frame code

o rethink list-item handling again
  o f:/html/list-padding.html: bullet turns into a box
  o f:/html/list-style-image.html: bullets don't trigger a reflow properly
    when the image size finally arrives

o have michael fix up the scrolling-view code so that if a document is
  scrolled and grown the relative scroll position is maintained so that
  the view doesn't jump around. Then re-enable the html content sink
  scroll-to-ref code in the incremental reflow cases.
  o scroll to #ref needs to be able to update the scrollbars when it
    finds the target frame has been reflowed.

pseudo-frame whackage

factories for html etc. so that viewer no longer links against the dll

async style sheet loading
async script src= loading
  need blocking model in content sink and parser

o Get rid of XXX::NewFrame methods
o ListTag(nsString& aResult) instead of FILE*
o style attributes of BODY tag
o style attributes of HTML tag
o turn noisy code in nsContainerFrame into NS_FRAME_TRACE calls

o implement the LINK tag including base attributes for style sheets
  and other linked objects

o LINK rel=stylesheet href=... type=text/css

Underlines across font/style changes look like cr*p. We should draw a
single underline that's the same size.

www.excite.com; crash

people.netscape.com/paquin/temple.html; crash

people.netscape.com/kipp - Hickman breaking bug

block-margins.html: margin after block & before text is lost

Content objects for: FORM, /FORM, MAP, AREA, SCRIPT, STYLE

width/height sizing stuff into body/block/inline code

image-map.html: top border is black; why?

css2 cursors into raptor

1 pass build on windows

o write a combinatoric test case of the all the different variations on
  url parsing and compare with navigator; get nsURL.cpp to agree with it.

security dialog support code using raptor

nspr log module list online
