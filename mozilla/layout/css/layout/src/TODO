todo for AOL August 1st deadline:
---------------------------------

o click on gif, jpg, txt

o http://www.aol.com/netfind
  o fix the size of the iframe
  o look into the parsing bug's

o http://www.magicbit.com/links/travel.htm; why is the SMART-NET image
  at the bottom instead of at the baseline?

o http://www.altavista.com looks wrong. why?
  why does it go into an infinite loop during a -f run?

o bug2.html

o UMR bug because of painting during reflow

o implement base tag support:
  o frame, iframe, frameset
  o layer
  o body background, table background, etc.

o TEST base tag support:
  o script src=
  o style src=

o missing space after ampersand on http://home.netscape.com

o fast scroll to #ref for a link targeted at the same document as is
  currently showing

o force-refresh needs to get the nsIScrollableView and update that view,
  not the root view

o f:/html/bug8.html (descent bug in vertically align children)

o Viewer:
  o make the print-preview menu item work
  o select-all and copy menu items
  o fix link-over status

o fix floating tables
  o current-line floaters need to go in previous line's bcl list; if first line
    then they go in the block-frame's pending floater list
  o <block><floater>... we need a place to hang current-line floaters!!!
  x http://www.news.com
  x http://www.usatoday.com/ 
  o http://www.mrshowbiz.com/
  o file:/f:/html/floating-images.html
	"tucked between the woofers" isn't
  o file:/f:/html/floating-tables-inline.html
	overwrite errors
  o file:/f:/html/br-clear.html
	3rd test case is not compatible with navigator; I think navigator
	has a bug IMHO.

o block-frame: DidReflow and content-appended can be smarter; right now
  we did-reflow the whole caboodle whereas we could keep a bit in the
  line that indicates where the dirty lines were so that when the
  block's parent comes along and does a did-reflow it can propogate it
  down to only the affected lines.

o fix blocks inside of inlines; need to find the block's inline-layout
  state and see where the block child is with respect to the left edge
  of the line.

o iframe on infoseek

x table tag is closing paragraphs

o mark/insert-at-mark for parser???

o www.cnn.com: crash

o performance:
  o people.netscape.com

o initial black reflow bug

o slide show resize bug

o fix assertion on LCIC in nscssblockframe::content-inserted when
  running rotate.html/js test

o docloader needs to disconnect itself as an observer when it's done

o fix limited stack depth in content sink

----------------------------------------------------------------------

o crash in: http://www-dsed.llnl.gov/documents/a_document.html
  the problem stems from a OL marked display:inline that contains LI's;
  the LI's aren't doing the right thing to find the container that
  has next ordinal number (which in this case is none!)

ebina margin bugs:
  BR tags
  line-height adjustment (sometimes; see test0.html and the large font)
  P's in LI's
  f:/html/bug3.html (yikes!)
  f:/html/bug6.html 
  www.infoseek.com; see steve's mail (date july 21st)
  www.w3.org

o rework how BR's work:
  f:/html/image-vspace.html; notice the top two lines stuck together in nav
  make clear-line a real style-const property and use it to mean "give me
  a fresh line". Then make br's zero height. Have the block code handle the
  fresh line concept directly...work this in with keeping track of pending
  vertical whitespace for table shrink wrapping.

o ebina's engine provides automatic margins around floating images that
  are PROPORTIONAL to the size of the image's border (find the code
  luke)

tinderbox: add selftest to our makefile so that it will run whatever
we want and verify the results of a build

o XXX code in block frame code

o rethink list-item handling again
  o f:/html/list-padding.html: bullet turns into a box
  o f:/html/list-style-image.html: bullets don't trigger a reflow properly
    when the image size finally arrives

o have michael fix up the scrolling-view code so that if a document is
  scrolled and grown the relative scroll position is maintained so that
  the view doesn't jump around. Then re-enable the html content sink
  scroll-to-ref code in the incremental reflow cases.
  o scroll to #ref needs to be able to update the scrollbars when it
    finds the target frame has been reflowed.

parser calls WillInterrupt at the *wrong time*

pseudo-frame whackage

factories for html etc. so that viewer no longer links against the dll

async style sheet loading
async script src= loading
  need blocking model in content sink and parser

o Get rid of XXX::NewFrame methods
o ListTag(nsString& aResult) instead of FILE*
o style attributes of BODY tag
o style attributes of HTML tag
o turn noisy code in nsContainerFrame into NS_FRAME_TRACE calls

o implement the LINK tag including base attributes for style sheets
  and other linked objects

o LINK rel=stylesheet href=... type=text/css

----------------------------------------

Underlines across font/style changes look like cr*p. We should draw a
single underline that's the same size.

----------------------------------------

www.excite.com; crash
people.netscape.com/paquin/temple.html; crash
people.netscape.com/kipp - Hickman breaking bug
block-margins.html: margin after block & before text is lost

----------------------------------------

Content objects for: FORM, /FORM, MAP, AREA, SCRIPT, STYLE

width/height sizing stuff into body/block/inline code

image-map.html: top border is black; why?

css2 cursors into raptor

load UA style sheet ONCE

1 pass build on windows

----------------------------------------

async dns slow mode

o write a combinatoric test case of the all the different variations on
  url parsing and compare with navigator; get nsURL.cpp to agree with it.

security dialog support code using raptor

nspr log module list online

----------------------------------------

css parser keeping comments
