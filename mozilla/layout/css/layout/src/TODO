todo for AOL August 1st deadline:
---------------------------------

x scroll to #ref

o fast scroll to #ref for a link targeted at the same document as is
currently showing

force-refresh needs to get the nsIScrollableView and update that view,
not the root view

Viewer:
  make the print-preview menu item work
  select-all and copy menu items
  fix link-over status

fix floating tables
  x need to update floating-frames lists on LineData's as the placeholders move
  o current-line floaters need to go in previous line's bcl list; if first line
    then they go in the block-frame's pending floater list
  o <block><floater>... we need a place to hang current-line floaters!!!
  o http://www.news.com
  o http://www.usatoday.com/ 

o block-frame: DidReflow and content-appended can be smarter; right now
  we did-reflow the whole caboodle whereas we could keep a bit in the
  line that indicates where the dirty lines were so that when the
  block's parent comes along and does a did-reflow it can propogate it
  down to only the affected lines.

o fix blocks inside of inlines; need to find the block's inline-layout
  state and see where the block child is with respect to the left edge
  of the line.

fix assertion on LCIC in nscssblockframe::content-inserted when
running rotate.html/js test

----------------------------------------------------------------------

have michael fix up the scrolling-view code so that if a document is
scrolled and grown the relative scroll position is maintained so that
the view doesn't jump around. Then re-enable the html content sink
scroll-to-ref code in the incremental reflow cases.

parser calls WillInterrupt at the *wrong time*

pseudo-frame whackage

factories for html etc. so that viewer no longer links against the dll

async style sheet loading
async script src= loading
  need blocking model in content sink and parser

o Get rid of XXX::NewFrame methods
o ListTag(nsString& aResult) instead of FILE*
o style attributes of BODY tag
o style attributes of HTML tag
o turn noisy code in nsContainerFrame into NS_FRAME_TRACE calls

----------------------------------------

Underlines across font/style changes look like cr*p. We should draw a
single underline that's the same size.
