todo for AOL August 1st deadline:
---------------------------------

o implement base tag support:
  o frame, iframe, frameset
  o layer

o TEST base tag support:
  x images
  x links
  x image maps (area tags)
  o script src=
  o style src=

o missing space after ampersand on http://home.netscape.com

o fast scroll to #ref for a link targeted at the same document as is
currently showing

force-refresh needs to get the nsIScrollableView and update that view,
not the root view

o f:/html/bug8.html (descent bug in vertically align children)

Viewer:
  make the print-preview menu item work
  select-all and copy menu items
  fix link-over status

fix floating tables
  x need to update floating-frames lists on LineData's as the placeholders move
  o current-line floaters need to go in previous line's bcl list; if first line
    then they go in the block-frame's pending floater list
  o <block><floater>... we need a place to hang current-line floaters!!!
  o http://www.news.com
  o http://www.usatoday.com/ 

o block-frame: DidReflow and content-appended can be smarter; right now
  we did-reflow the whole caboodle whereas we could keep a bit in the
  line that indicates where the dirty lines were so that when the
  block's parent comes along and does a did-reflow it can propogate it
  down to only the affected lines.

o fix blocks inside of inlines; need to find the block's inline-layout
  state and see where the block child is with respect to the left edge
  of the line.

iframe on infoseek

x table tag is closing paragraphs

mark/insert-at-mark for parser???

----------------------------------------------------------------------

ebina margin bugs:
  BR tags
  line-height adjustment (sometimes; see test0.html and the large font)
  P's in LI's
  f:/html/bug3.html (yikes!)
  f:/html/bug6.html 

tinderbox: add selftest to our makefile so that it will run whatever
we want and verify the results of a build

o have michael fix up the scrolling-view code so that if a document is
  scrolled and grown the relative scroll position is maintained so that
  the view doesn't jump around. Then re-enable the html content sink
  scroll-to-ref code in the incremental reflow cases.
  o scroll to #ref needs to be able to update the scrollbars when it
    finds the target frame has been reflowed.

parser calls WillInterrupt at the *wrong time*

pseudo-frame whackage

factories for html etc. so that viewer no longer links against the dll

async style sheet loading
async script src= loading
  need blocking model in content sink and parser

o Get rid of XXX::NewFrame methods
o ListTag(nsString& aResult) instead of FILE*
o style attributes of BODY tag
o style attributes of HTML tag
o turn noisy code in nsContainerFrame into NS_FRAME_TRACE calls

o implement the LINK tag including base attributes for style sheets
  and other linked objects

Underlines across font/style changes look like cr*p. We should draw a
single underline that's the same size.
