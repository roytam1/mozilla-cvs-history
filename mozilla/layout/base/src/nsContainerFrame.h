/**
 * Implementation of a container frame. Supports being used a pseudo-
 * frame (a frame that maps the same content as its parent).
 *
 * Container frame iterates its child content and for each content object creates
 * one or more child frames. There are three member variables (class invariants)
 * used to manage this mapping:
 * <dl>
 * <dt>mFirstContentOffset
 *   <dd>the content offset of the first piece of content mapped by this container.
 * <dt>mLastContentOffset
 *   <dd>the content offset of the last piece of content mapped by this container
 * <dt>mLastContentIsComplete
 *   <dd>a boolean indicating whether the last piece of content mapped by this
 *       container is complete, or whether its frame needs to be continued.
 * </dl>
 *
 * Here are the rules governing the state of the class invariants. The debug member
 * functions PreReflowCheck() and PostReflowCheck() validate these rules. For the
 * purposes of this discussion an <i>empty</i> frame is defined as a container
 * frame with a null child-list, i.e. its mFirstChild is nsnull.
 *
 * <h3>Non-Empty Frames</h3>
 * For a container frame that is not an empty frame the following must be true:
 * <ul>
 * <li>if the first child frame is a pseudo-frame then mFirstContentOffset must be
 *     equal to the first child's mFirstContentOffset; otherwise, mFirstContentOffset
 *     must be equal to the first child frame's index in parent
 * <li>if the last child frame is a pseudo-frame then mLastContentOffset must be
 *     equal to the last child's mLastContentOffset; otherwise, mLastContentOffset
 *     must be equal to the last child frame's index in parent
 * <li>if the last child is a pseudo-frame then mLastContentIsComplete should be
 *     equal to that last child's mLastContentIsComplete; otherwise, if the last
 *     child frame has a next-in-flow then mLastContentIsComplete must be PR_TRUE
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Empty Frames</h3>
 * For an empty container frame the following must be true:
 * <ul>
 * <li>mFirstContentOffset must be equal to the NextContentOffset() of the first
 *     non-empty prev-in-flow
 * <li>mChildCount must be 0
 * </ul>
 *
 * The value of mLastContentOffset and mLastContentIsComplete are <i>undefined</i>
 * for an empty frame.
 *
 * <h3>Next-In-Flow List</h3>
 * The rule is that if a container frame is not complete then the mFirstContentOffset,
 * mLastContentOffset, and mLastContentIsComplete of its next-in-flow frames must
 * <b>always</b> correct. This means that whenever you push/pull child frames from a
 * next-in-flow you <b>must</b> update that next-in-flow's state so that it is
 * consistent with the aforementioned rules for empty and non-empty frames.
 *
 * <h3>Pulling-Up Frames</h3>
 * In the processing of pulling-up child frames from a next-in-flow it's possible
 * to pull-up all the child frames from a next-in-flow thereby leaving the next-in-flow
 * empty. There are two cases to consider:
 * <ol>
 * <li>All of the child frames from all of the next-in-flow have been pulled-up.
 *     This means that all the next-in-flow frames are empty, the container being
 *     reflowed is complete, and the next-in-flows will be deleted.
 *
 *     In this case the next-in-flows' mFirstContentOffset is also undefined.
 * <li>Not all the child frames from all the next-in-flows have been pulled-up.
 *     This means the next-in-flow consists of one or more empty frames followed
 *     by one or more non-empty frames. Note that all the empty frames must be
 *     consecutive. This means it is illegal to have an empty frame followed by
 *     a non-empty frame, followed by an empty frame, followed by a non-empty frame.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h3>Pseudo-Frames</h3>
 * As stated above, when pulling/pushing child frames from/to a next-in-flow the
 * state of the next-in-flow must be updated.
 *
 * If the next-in-flow is a pseudo-frame then not only does the next-in-flow's state
 * need to be updated, but the state of its geometric parent must be updated as well.
 * See member function PropagateContentOffsets() for details.
 *
 * This rule is applied recursively, so if the next-in-flow's geometric parent is
 * also a pseudo-frame then its geometric parent must be updated.
