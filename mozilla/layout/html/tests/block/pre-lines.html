 <BODY>
<PRE>
Blank lines within a PRE are being lost, replaced with simply a newline.  For 
example, there should be a blank line after this line:

This could be either in the behaviour of white-space: pre (more likely), or, 
for all I know (although it's unlikely), in font-family: monospace.  See bug 
582 for monospace stuff.
