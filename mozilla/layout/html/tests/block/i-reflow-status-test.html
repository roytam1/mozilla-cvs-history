    Test the block/inline handling of the various reflow status values returned
    from child frames. This lead in is a long line of text which will trigger
    the handling of "not-complete" reflow status. In addition, because the
    line ends in a BR tag this will also test the handling of the "break-after"
    reflow status.

    Same idea, but with the test wrapped in a B tag container:
    <BR>
    <B>
    Test the block/inline handling of the various reflow status values returned
    from child frames. This lead in is a long line of text which will trigger
    the handling of "not-complete" reflow status. In addition, because the
    line ends in a BR tag this will also test the handling of the "break-after"
    reflow status.
