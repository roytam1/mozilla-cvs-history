  This test demonstrates the "width" style property as applied to blocks:
  <DIV CLASS=w1>
   This block should be 100 pixels wide with zero margins which means
   that it should be attached to the left edge because the outer block
   has a direction of left-to-right.
  </DIV>
  <DIV CLASS=w2>
   This block should be half the width of its parent,
   with zero margins which means
   that it should be attached to the left edge because the outer block
   has a direction of left-to-right.
  </DIV>
  <DIV CLASS=w3>
   This block should be 100% the width of its parent,
   with zero margins which means
   that it should be attached to the left edge because the outer block
   has a direction of left-to-right.
  </DIV>
 </BODY>
