 <BODY>
  <DIV CLASS=in4>
   <DIV CLASS=in3>
    This text should be indented two inches because the parent element
    (the outer div) has a content-width of 4 inches and the text-indent for
    this element is set to 50%.
   </DIV>
  </DIV>
  <TABLE CLASS=in4 border=1>

    <TD>
     <DIV CLASS=in3>
      This text should be indented two inches because the parent element
      (the outer div) has a content-width of 4 inches and the text-indent for
      this element is set to 50%.
     </DIV>
    </TD>
   </TR>
  </TABLE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE CLASS=bq>
   This is text-indented by 50%. Because the blockquote has substantial
   margin values, the indent will place the text closer to the right edge
   of the blockquote (the blockquote is smaller than its parents because
   of its margin, but the text-indent is relative to the elements parent
   which is the BODY not the blockquote itself).
