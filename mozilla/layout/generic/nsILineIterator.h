// the bottom line.
//
// NOTE: while you can get this interface by doing a slezy hacky
// QueryInterface on block frames, it isn't like a normal com
// interface: its not reflexive (you can't query back to the block
// frame) and unlike other frames, it *IS* reference counted so don't
// forget to NS_RELEASE it when you are done with it!

// This bit is set when the line is wrapping up a block frame. When
// clear, it means that the line contains inline elements.

// This bit, when set, indicates that the line has had a trailing
// white-space compressed. The bit is only set on lines that contain
