/*================================================
¥¥¥IMPORTANT
This class should be COM'd and made XP somehow
Right now it is just a normal class as the first step of breaking
it out from the "client" code. It's goal is to be the point of contact between
client code (say, the viewer) and the embedded webshell for event dispatching. From
here, it goes to the appropriate window, however that may be done (and that still
needs to be figured out).
(pinkerton)

This class now has an added responsibility, which
is to maintain a list of raptor windows. This is
stored as an STL map, which maps from a WindowPtr
to a nsMacWindow *.
