# Library of atomic functions for UltraSparc systems

# implementation of the nspr atomic functions for UltraSparc systems) in addition
# to libnspr.so. (The actual name of the library is
# lib$(ULTRASPARC_LIBRARY)$(MOD_VERSION).so
#
# The actual name of the filter-library, recorded in libnspr.so, is set to the
# value of $(ULTRASPARC_FILTER_LIBRARY).
# For an application to use the assembly-language implementation, a link should be
# made so that opening ULTRASPARC_FILTER_LIBRARY results in opening
# ULTRASPARC_LIBRARY. This indirection requires the user to explicitly set up
# library for use on UltraSparc systems, thereby helping to avoid using it by
# accident on non-UltraSparc systems.
# The directory containing the ultrasparc libraries should be in LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
