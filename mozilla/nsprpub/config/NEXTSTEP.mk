# "Commons" are tentative definitions in a global scope, like this:

# The meaning of a common is ambiguous.  It may be a true definition:

# or it may be a declaration of a symbol defined in another file:
#     extern int x;
# Use the -fno-common option to force all commons to become true
# definitions so that the linker can catch multiply-defined symbols.
