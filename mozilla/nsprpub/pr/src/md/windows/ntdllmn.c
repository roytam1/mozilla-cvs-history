 * The DLL entry point (DllMain) for NSPR.
 *
 * The only reason we use DLLMain() now is to find out whether
 * the NSPR DLL is statically or dynamically loaded.  When
 * dynamically loaded, we cannot use static thread-local storage.
 * However, static TLS is faster than the TlsXXX() functions.
 * So we want to use static TLS whenever we can.  A global
 * variable _pr_use_static_tls is set in DllMain() during process
 * attachment to indicate whether it is safe to use static TLS
 * or not.
