/*
** RCCondition - C++ wrapper around NSPR's PRCondVar
**
** Conditions have a notion of timeouts. A thread that waits on a condition
** will resume execution when the condition is notified OR when a specified
** interval of time has expired.
**
** Most applications don't adjust the timeouts on conditions. The literature
** would argue that all threads waiting on a single condition must have the
** same semantics. But if an application wishes to modify the timeout with
** (perhaps) each wait call, that modification should be done consistantly
** and under protection of the condition's associated lock.
**
** The default timeout is infinity.
