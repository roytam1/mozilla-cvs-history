General
=======

Ever wanted to use html pages in your app?
Show your help-pages in a fancy way?

Now it's all possible. GtkMozilla is a widget that makes it easy
to embedd the layout engine from the Mozilla project in any Gtk+
program.

Note that Mozilla is a work in progress, and if you use a later
(or earlier) version of the Mozilla sources you might need to
do some small changes.

The tree i've been using is from cvs checked out May 18 1999.

Compilation
===========
To compile GtkMozilla you need a compiled version of the Mozilla
source tree. Then you just need to run configure and point it at
your mozilla directory.

Something like this:
./configure --with-mozilla=/dir/where/mozilla/is

This builds the basic GtkMozilla library and two examples.

Note:
If you use a later version than me you might need to update
the nsSetupRegistry.cpp file. It is just a copy of
mozilla/webshell/tests/viewer/nsSetupRegistry.cpp
in the Mozilla source tree.

Examples
========

When you compiled GtkMozilla two examples are built, simplebrowser
and helpbrowser. simplebrowser is a small app that can be used to
browse the web. helpbrowser is a small demo of how GtkMozilla could
be used to add help facilities to an app. It contains some demo
text taken from the gdb info pages.

To run the demos (or any program using GtkMozilla) you need to
set some enviroment variables. These help mozilla locating
libraries and datafiles it needs.

If you're running bash, just type something like this (replace the dir
 name):

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/dir/where/mozilla/is/dist/bin 
export MOZILLA_FIVE_HOME=/dir/where/mozilla/is/dist/bin

Then try out the examples:

examples/simplebrowser/simplebrowser

and

examples/helpbrowser/helpbrowser
