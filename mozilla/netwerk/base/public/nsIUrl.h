/**
 * The nsIURI class is an interface to the URI behaviour for parsing
 * portions out of a URI. This follows Tim Berners-Lee's URI spec at-
 * 
 *   http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URI/URI_Overview.html
 * 
 * For the purpose of this class, here is the most elaborate form of a URI
 * and its corresponding parts-
 * 
 *   ftp://username:password@hostname:portnumber/pathname
 *   \ /   \               / \      / \        /\       /
 *    -     ---------------   ------   --------  -------
 *    |            |             |        |         |
 *    |            |             |        |        Path
 *    |            |             |       Port         
 *    |            |            Host
 *    |         PreHost            
 *    Scheme
 * 
 * Note that this class does not assume knowledge of search/query portions 
 * embedded within the path portion of the URI.
 * 
 * This class pretty much "final" and there shouldn't be anything added.
 * If you do feel something belongs here, please do send me a mail. Thanks!
