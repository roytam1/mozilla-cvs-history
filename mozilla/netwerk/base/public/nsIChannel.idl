/**
 * The nsIChannel interface allows the user to construct I/O requests for
 * specific protocols, and manage them in a uniform way. Once a channel
 * is created (via nsIIOService::NewChannel), parameters for that request
 * may be set by using the channel attributes, or by QueryInterfacing to a
 * subclass of nsIChannel for protocol-specific parameters. Then the actual
 * request can be issued in one of several ways:
 *
 *      - AsyncRead and AsyncWrite allow for asynchronous requests, calling
 *        back the user's stream listener or observer,
 *      - OpenInputStream and OpenOutputStream allow for synchronous reads
 *        and writes on the underlying channel.
 *
 * After a request has been completed, the channel is still valid for
 * accessing protocol-specific results. For example, QueryInterfacing to 
 * nsIHTTPChannel allows response headers to be retrieved that result from
 * http transactions. 
 *
 * Note that a channel is really only valid for one request. Reusing a channel
 * after a request has completed for a subsequent request may have undefined
 * results, depending on the channel implementation.
 *
 * Also of note are a special kind of channel called "transports." Transports
 * also implement the nsIChannel interface, but operate at a lower level from
 * protocol channels. The socket and file transports are notable implementations
 * of transports and allow higher level channels to be implemented. The cache
 * may also behave as a transport, and possibly things like sound playing services
 * etc. Transports usually operate in a separate thread and often multiplex
 * multiple requests for the same kind of service or resources.
