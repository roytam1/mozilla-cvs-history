/* 
    The nsHTTPRequestObserver class is the request writer observer that 
    receives notifications of OnStartBinding and OnStopBinding as the
    request is being written out to the server. Each instance of this 
    class is tied to the corresponding transport that it writes the 
    request to. 
    
    The essential purpose of this class is to create the response listener 
    once it is done writing a request and also notify the handler when 
    this is done writing a request out. The latter could be used (later) 
    to do pipelining.

    This class is internal to the protocol handler implementation and 
    should theroetically not be used by the app or the core netlib.
