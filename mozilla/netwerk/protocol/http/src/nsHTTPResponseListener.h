/* 
    The nsHTTPResponseListener class is the response reader listener that 
    receives notifications of OnStartBinding, OnDataAvailable and 
    OnStopBinding as the data is received from the server. Each instance 
    of this class is tied to the corresponding transport that it reads the
    response data stream from. 

  
    The essential purpose of this class is to create the actual response 
    based on the data that is coming off the net. 

    This class is internal to the protocol handler implementation and 
    should theroetically not be used by the app or the core netlib.
