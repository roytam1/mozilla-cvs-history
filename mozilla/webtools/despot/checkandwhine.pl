You have a mozilla.org account, which is used to access various things at
mozilla.org.  Currently, your account has been disabled, and will stay 
disabled until you change your password.

To change your password, please visit
https://despot.mozilla.org/despot.cgi.
If you can't get that to work, send mail to sysadmins@mozilla.org.

Unless you take some action, you will probably get this very same email
every day.
