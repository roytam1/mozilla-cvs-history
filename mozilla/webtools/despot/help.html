<h1>Despot help</h1>

<a href="despot.cgi">Despot</a> is the system for administrating users
at mozilla.org.

<h3>Users</h3>

A username is someone with an e-mail address.  As far as Despot is
concerned, the e-mail address *is* the username.  We don't give away
new sets of ids, we just use the full e-mail address.

<p>

CVS account names are the full e-mail address, with the '@' replaced
by a '%'.

<p>

For each user, we also record:

<ul>
  <li> The full name.
  <li> An encrypted password.
  <li> Whether this user is a "despot" -- one of the elite few who can
       view anything, change anything.  A despot is an administrator,
       a superuser.
  <li> What group the user is in on each of our CVS repositories.  At
       the moment, the legal groups are:
       <ul>
	 <li> <b>None</b> -- not allowed to use this repository at
	      all.
	 <li> <b>cvsuser / webmonkey</b> -- normal usage.
	 <li> <b>cvsadm</b> -- can access the entire CVS repository,
	      including all the administrative stuff in CVSROOT.
       </ul>
  <li> Whether the users account is frozen until they change their
       password.
  <li> A numeric ID (used internally only).
</ul>



<a name="partition">
<h3>Partitions</h3>
</a>

A partition in Despot is a section of a CVS tree.  It defines a
branch and a set of files within that branch.  There should be a
partition for every module listed in the <a
href="http://www.mozilla.org/owners.html">module owners</a> document.
I could've used the word "module" here, but I hate it.  (Not that
"partition" is much better.)

<p>

Anyway, for each branch, every file may appear in at most one
partition.  Put another way, if a given file appears in more than
partition, then it must be on a different branch in each of those
partitions.

<p>

Each partition defines the following:

<a name="branch">
<h4>Branch</h4>
</a>
The branch for this partition.  HEAD means the trunk; no branch.

<a name="files">
<h4>Files</h4>
</a>
A list of files.  If the last characters are "/*", then it means
"anything in this directory, or in any subdirectory".  If the last
characters are "/%", then it means only files within this directory;
subdirectories are not included.

<a name="Owner">
<h4>Owners</h4>
</a>
This is a list of people who are considered to own this partition.
They are all-powerful, within the limits of their partition.

<a name="Peer">
<h4>Peers</h4>
</a>
This is a list of people that the owners have designated as primary
support people for this partition.  In theory, they have less powers
than the Owners, but at present they are treated identically.

<a name="Member">
<h4>Members</h4>
</a>
This is a list of people that are allowed to check into the partition
when the partition has been put into "restricted" mode.

<a name="state">
<h4>State</h4>
</a>
A partition is in one of these states:
<p>

<table>
<tr>
<th align=right valign=top>Open:</th>
<td>Anyone in the world may change any of the files in this partition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th align=right valign=top>Restricted:</th>
<td>Only Owners, Peers, and Members may change files in this partition.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th align=right valign=top>Closed:</th>
<td>Only Owners and Peers may change files in this partition.</td>
</tr>
</table>
