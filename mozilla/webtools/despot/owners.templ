    <h1>Module Owners</h1>

    <p>
      This page lists Module Owners and their Peers for Mozilla code modules.
    </p>

    <p>
      A <dfn>Code Module</dfn> is a collection of source files that form a
      coherent bundle. An <dfn>Owner</dfn> is the person in charge of a Module.
      A <dfn>Peer</dfn> is a person whom the Owner has designated to help
      maintain the Module. If a Module has an Owner, the Owner or a Peer should
      in general review all code changes that go into that module.
    </p>

    <p>
      A list of <a
      href="http://wiki.mozilla.org/Module_Owners_Activities_Modules">Module
      Owners for activities other than code management</a> is maintained
      separately.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <a href="https://despot.mozilla.org/despot.cgi">database</a> from
      which this document is generated sometimes gets out of date. In order to
      identify the people to talk to about a particular source tree directory,
      it may be better to consult <a
      href="http://bonsai.mozilla.org/cvsqueryform.cgi">Bonsai</a> to see who
      is regularly checking-in changes.

    <p>
      Questions about module ownership should be directed to the owner or
      peers of the <a
