This page lists mozilla.org Module Owners and their Peers.
<P>
A <I>Module</I> is a collection of source files that form a coherent bundle.
An <I>Owner</I> is the person in charge of a Module.
A <I>Peer</I> is a person whom the Owner has designated to help maintain the
Module.
If a Module has an Owner, the Owner or a Peer should in general review all
code changes that go into that module.
