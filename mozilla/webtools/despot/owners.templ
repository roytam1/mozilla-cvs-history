<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>module owners</H1><P>

An <I>Owner</I> is responsible for fielding bug reports, enhancement requests,
patch submissions, and so on.  The owner should facilitate good development,
as defined by the developer community.  Most of the owners below happen to work
for Netscape, but that's not a prerequisite.  For example, we'd be delighted to
find an owner from outside Netscape for the <A href='#Berkeley'>Berkeley-DB</A>
code (really, for a newer version of it that works on all our platforms).
<P>
A <I>Module</I> is a collection of source files that form a coherent bundle,
probably a library (whether DLL/DSO or static).  Some modules, notably the
Front Ends, link as executables.  We would like most modules to use
<A href='#XP-COM'>XP-COM</A>, but only a few have been converted and released
to mozilla.org so far.
<P>
A <I>Platform</I> is pragmatically defined by the kind of code you have to
port, which is mostly UI code in the <A href='#StubFE'>Front Ends</A>.
CPU architecture and OS dependencies are mostly abstracted by
<A href='#NSPR'>NSPR</A>.  If you're contemplating a port (e.g., to BeOS on one
or more hardware platforms), please mail <A href='mailto:brendan@netscape.com'>brendan</A>,
nominate some peers, and provide some documents.
<P>
(FE = Front End, BE = Back End, XP = Cross Platform)
