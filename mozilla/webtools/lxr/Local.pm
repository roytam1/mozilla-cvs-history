# dme: Create descriptions for a file in a directory listing
# If no description, return the string "\&nbsp\;" to keep the
# table looking pretty.
#
# In mozilla search the beginning of a source file for a short 
# description. Not all files have them and the ones that do use 
# many different formats. Try to find as many of these without
# printing gobbeldygook or something silly like a file name or a date.
#
# Read in the beginning of the file into a string. I chose 60 because the 
# Berkeley copyright notice is around 40 lines long so we need a bit more 
# than this.
#
# Its common for file descriptions to be delimited by the file name or
# the word "Description" which preceeds the description. Search the entire
# string for these. Sometimes they're put in odd places such as inside
# the copyright notice or after the code begins. The file name should be
# followed by a colon or some pattern of dashes. 
#
# If no such description is found then use the contents of the "first"
# comment as the description. First, strip off the copyright notice plus
# anything before it. Remove rcs comments. Search for the first bit of
# code (usually #include) and remove it plus anything after it. In what's
# left, find the contents of the first comment, and get the first paragraph.
# If that's too long, use only the first sentence up to a period. If that's 
# still too long then we probably have a list or something that will look 
# strange if we print it out so give up and return null.
#
# Yes, this is a lot of trouble to go through but its easier than getting
# people to use the same format and re-writing thousands of comments. Not
# everything printed will really be a summary of the file, but still the
# signal/noise ratio seems pretty high.
#
# Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of pattern
# matching, I shall fear no regex.
