<HR><H2>Motivation</H2>
The Linux Cross-Reference project is the testbed application of a
general hypertext cross-referencing tool.  (Or the other way around.)

<P>
The main goal of the project is to create a versatile
cross-referencing tool for relatively large code repositories.  The
project is based on stock web technology, so the codeview client may
be chosen from the full range of available web browsers.  On the
server side, any Unix-based web server with cgi-script capability
should do nicely.

<P>
The main feature of the indexer is of course the ability to jump
easily to the declaration of any global identifier.  Indeed, even all
<I>references</I> to global identifiers are indexed.  Quick access to
function declarations, data (type) definitions and preprocessor macros
makes code browsing just that tad more convenient.  At-a-glance
overview of e.g. which code areas that will be affected by changing a
function or type definition should also come in useful during
development and debugging.

<P>
Other bits of hypertextual sugar, such as e-mail and include file
links, are provided as well, but is on the whole, well, sugar.  Some
minimal visual markup is also done.  (Style sheets are considered as a
way to do this in the future.)


<HR><H2>Technicalities</H2>
The index generator is written in <A HREF="http://www.perl.org">Perl</A>
and relies heavily on Perl's regular expression facilities.  The
algorithm used is very brute force and extremely sloppy.  The
rationale behind the sloppiness is that too little information renders
the database useless, while too much information simply means the
users have to think and navigate at the same time.

<P>
The Linux source code, with which the project has initially been
linked, presents the indexer with some very tough obstacles.
Specifically, the heavy use of preprocessor macros makes the parsing a
virtual nightmare.  We want to index the information in the
preprocessor directives as well as the actual C code, so we have to
parse both at once, which leads to no end of trouble.  (Strict parsing
is right out.)  Still, we're pretty satisfied with what the indexer
manages to get out of it.

<P>
There's also the question of actually broken code.  We want to
reasonably index all code portions, even if some of it is not entirely
syntactically valid.  This is another reason for the sloppiness.

<P>
There are obviously disadvantages to this approach.  No scope checking
is done, and the most annoying effect of this is mistaking local
identifers for references to global ones with the same name.  This
particular problem (and others) can only be solved by doing (almost)
full parsing.  The feasibility of combining this with the fuzzy way
indexing is currently done is being looked into.

<P>
An identifier is a macro, typedef, struct, enum, union, function,
function prototype or variable. For the Linux source code between
50000 and 60000 identifiers are collected. The individual files of the
sourcecode are formatted on the fly and presented with clickable
identifiers.

<P>
It is possible to search among the identifiers and the entire
kernel source text. The freetext search is implemented using <A
HREF="http://glimpse.cs.arizona.edu">Glimpse</A>, so all the
capabilities of Glimpse are available. Especially the regular expression
search capabilities are useful. 

<HR><H2>Availability</H2>
The code for the indexer is released under the
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org">GNU</A>
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html">Copyleft</A>
license. Go to <A HREF="http://lxr.linux.no">LXR main site</A> to
get the latest version.


<HR><H2>Contacting the authors</H2>
We would very much like to receive feedback on this project. If you
find it useful or have suggestions on how to make improvements, feel
free to send us e-mail. We hope that this will be a useful tool, both
for experienced developers and beginners wanting to explore the Linux
sourcecode.
