# this file and installtypes.txt allow for the different installation types
# in this file, every file in the bugzilla dist is listed. If a file is not listed,
# it will not be copied into the the dist and will not work. Be sure to add all 
# new files here. Note that files inside directories listed here will be automatically
# copied. The | and code next to each filename indicates its type. installtypes.txt uses
# these types to determine where to install the files. 
# res: resources (images, html, js, etc)
# cgi: cgi files
# mod: modules
# scpt: .pl or other scripts without extention
# req: something that must be with the other cgi scripts for bugzilla to work
# null: not needed in the dist, discard
