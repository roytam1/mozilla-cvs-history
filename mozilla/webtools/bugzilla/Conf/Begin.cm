Welcome to Bugzilla!

I'm going to ask you a few questions about how you would like your 
new bugzilla installation to be setup. If you have configured Bugzilla 
before, I will load defaults from that installation, otherwise, 
I will display recomended values.

Thanks for using Bugzilla,

The Bugzilla Team
