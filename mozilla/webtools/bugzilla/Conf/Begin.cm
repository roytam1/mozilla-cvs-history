Welcome to Bugzilla!

I'm going to ask you a few questions about how you would like your 
new Bugzilla installation to be setup. If you have configured Bugzilla 
before, I will load defaults from that installation, otherwise, 
I will display recomended values for your system. 

You may see this message more than once if Configure needs to restart. 
This is normal. 

Press any key to continue.

Thanks for using Bugzilla,

The Bugzilla Team
