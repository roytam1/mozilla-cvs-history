<TITLE>Clue</TITLE>
<H1>A Clue</H1>
This form will allow you to call up a subset of the bug list.
You should be able to add the URL of the resulting list to
your bookmark file in order to preserve queries.
<p>
The way the query works, if you have nothing checked in a box,
then all values for that field are legal, for example if you checked nothing
in any of the boxes, you would get the entire bug list.
<p>
The default value of this form should correspond roughly to a "personal"
bug list.

<H2>Running queries not supported by the pretty boxes</H2>
There is a hacky way to do some searches that aren't supported by the
form.  The buglist script will build queries based on the URL, so
you can add other criteria.
<P>
For example, if you wanted to see all bugs reported against the X platform
and assigned to jwz, you could ask for all bugs assign to jwz, then
edit the URL in the "Location" box, adding the clause "&rep_platform=X-Windows"
to the URL.
<P>
Here is a list of some of the field names you could use for additional
unsupported searches ...

<PRE>
version
rep_platform
op_sys
reporter area
bug_file_loc
short_desc
</PRE>
<HR>
<H1>Browser Notes</H1>
<P>Bugzilla uses several non-standard Netscape extentions, but this does not seem
to case any problem with other browsers.  The lynx browser does work, but lynx
seems to cache results of a .cgi.  You'll sometimes need to press CONTROL-R to reload
the screen to see an update.
