are updating from an older verseion, make sure that you check this file!

will tell you what has been changed in the last week.

10/27/98 security check for legal products in place. bug charts are not
available as an option if collectstats.pl has never been run. all products 
get daily stats collected now. README updated: Chart::Base is listed as
a requirement, instructions for using collectstats.pl included as 
an optional step. also got silly and added optional quips to bug
reports. 
 
10/17/98 modified README installation instructions slightly. 

10/16/98 Updated all of the cgi programs to quote all HTML fields
to prevent any "suprises" as fields are used for different things
than they were originally.  (Like when the product field gained
spaces in the product name.)

10/15/98 Added a security mechanism so that you can define groups of
users, and what fields those users are allowed to edit.  Two new
tables were added (security and groups), and the profiles table was
extended to support this.  The security table is a list of "labels"
and a number that maps to a bit.  The idea is that you query the
label, get the bit field, and compare that to the permissions
given to the user via the bitmap in the groups table.

Also broke out the UI portion of the cgi scripts into seperate files 
that will allow a site to customize the look and feel without mucking 
with the code as much.  This also could allow for a seperate look and 
feel for a set of users, if the site were so inclined.  

Cleaned up some of the error forms to include the generic header.

10/13/98 Added a new table called "platforms".  This is used to build
the platform entries based on the product selected.  There is a
makeplatformtable.sh that must be run to create and populate the new
table.

10/7/98 Added a new table called "products".  Right now, this is used
only to have a description for each product, and that description is
only used when initially adding a new bug.  Anyway, you *must* create
the new table (which you can do by running the new makeproducttable.sh
script).  If you just leave it empty, things will work much as they
did before, or you can add descriptions for some or all of your
products.


9/15/98 Everything has been ported to Perl.  NO MORE TCL.  This
transition should be relatively painless, except for the "params"
file.  This is the file that contains parameters you've set up on the
editparams.cgi page.  Before changing to Perl, this was a tcl-syntax
file, stored in the same directory as the code; after the change to
Perl, it becomes a perl-syntax file, stored in a subdirectory named
"data".  See the README file for more details on what version of Perl
you need.

So, if updating from an older version of Bugzilla, you will need to
edit data/param, change the email address listed for
$::param{'maintainer'}, and then go revisit the editparams.cgi page
and reset all the parameters to your taste.  Fortunately, your old
params file will still be around, and so you ought to be able to
cut&paste important bits from there.

Also, note that the "whineatnews" script has changed name (it now has
an extension of .pl instead of .tcl), so you'll need to change your
cron job.

And the "comments" file has been moved to the data directory.  Just do
"cat comments >> data/comments" to restore any old comments that may
have been lost.



9/2/98 Changed the way password validation works.  We now keep a
crypt'd version of the password in the database, and check against
that.  (This is silly, because we're also keeping the plaintext
version there, but I have plans...)  Stop passing the plaintext
password around as a cookie; instead, we have a cookie that references
a record in a new database table, logincookies.

IMPORTANT: if updating from an older version of Bugzilla, you must run
the following commands to keep things working:

 ./makelogincookiestable.sh
 echo "alter table profiles add column cryptpassword varchar(64);" | mysql bugs
 echo "update profiles set cryptpassword = encrypt(password,substring(rand(),3, 4));" | mysql bugs
