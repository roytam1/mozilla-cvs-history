<A NAME="whatisit"><H2>What is it?</H2></A>

Bugzilla is a bug tracking system developed at 
<A HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/">mozilla.org</A>.
It was originally used to track the bugs in the 
Mozilla web browser. Red Hat has customized it to 
track bugs in our Linux products.

<A NAME="howdoienter"><H2>How do I enter a bug?</H2></A>

To enter a bug, select <I><A HREF="enter_bug.cgi">Enter a new bug</A></I>
from the <A HREF="/bugzilla/">main bugzilla page</A>.  This will 
take you to a product selection screen.
<P>
From this screen you select the product that you wish to enter a bug
for, by selecting the hightlighted product name.  This will take you 
to a bug entry screen.
<P>
<B>Example:</B> <I>Red Hat Linux</I>
<P>
From the bug entry screen, you need to select the version of the 
product that you are entering a bug on, along with which component
of the product that is having a problem.
<P>
<B>Example:</B> <I>5.2</I> and <I>acm</I>
<P>
Next, select the <A HREF="bug_status.phtml#priority">Priority</A> 
and <A HREF="bug_status.phtml#severity">Severity</A> of your bug.
<P>
<B>Example:</B> <I>Normal</I> and <I>Normal</I>
<P>
Then you will select which 
<A HREF="bug_status.phtml#rep_platform">Architecture</A> your bug
occurs on.
<P>
<B>Example:</B> If you are using an Intel x86 platform, 
you will choose <I>i386</I>.
<P>
The <I>Cc:</I> field can be used to add someone to the carbon-copy
list for all email related to this bug.  As the reporter of the bug,
you will automatically be copied on any mail, so you do not need to
add yourself to this.
<P>
Enter a one line description of the bug into the <I>Summary</I> field, 
and the full description of the bug inot the <I>Description</I> field.

<A NAME="whathappens"><H2>What happens once I enter a bug?</H2></A>

After you enter a bug, mail is sent both to you and the QA department
of Red Hat.  A member of the QA department will verify that they can
reproduce your bug, and may contact you to get additional information.
<P>
After the bug has been <A HREF="bug_status.phtml#verified">verified</A>, 
it will be assigned to a developer to look into a resolution for the bug.
<P>
Once a resolution has been found, the bug will be marked 
<A HREF="bug_status.phtml#resolved">RESOLVED</A> with a 
<A HREF="bug_status.phtml#fixed">resolution status</A>.
<P>
At each step of the process, you will get an email message that will
tell you what has been updated on your bug report.

<A NAME="howdoisearch"><H2>How do I search for a bug?</H2></A>

To search for a bug, select <A HREF="query.cgi"><I>Go to the query page</I></A>
from the <A HREF="/bugzilla/">main bugzilla page</A>.
<P>
The bugzilla search uses an "OR" within each field, 
with an "AND" between fields.   So, if you were to
select <A HREF="bug_status.phtml#new"><B>NEW</B></A> and 
<A HREF="bug_status.phtml#verified"><B>VERIFIED</B></A> from the 
<A HREF="bug_status.phtml#status"><I>Status</I></A> field and 
<B>normal</B> from the <A HREF="bug_status.phtml#priority"><I>Priority</I></A>
field, you would be asking for all normal priority bugs that are
new or verified.

<A NAME="#howdoipatch"><H2>How do I submit a patch?</H2></A>

Send your patch to 
<A HREF="mailto:bugzilla@redhat.com?subject=BUG%20ID%20%23">bugzilla@redhat.com</A> 
with the subject line of "BUG ID #" followed by your bug number.  
<P>
This will preserve the format of your patch so that it does not 
get mangled by HTML or CGI parsing, and will make it easier for 
our developers to apply and test your patch.
<P>
<BLINK><B>PLEASE DO NOT SEND MAIL AS ROOT!</B></BLINK>
<P>
The mail filters that process patches are setup to avoid mail loops,
and do not process mail that is sent from system accounts, such as
root.  Please send mail from a normal user account.
<P>
