Usage:

  Use this script to add a custom field to your Bugzilla installation
  by invoking it with the --name and --desc command-line options:

  $command --name=<field_name> --desc="<field description>"

  <field_name> is the name of the custom field in the database.
  The string "cf_" will be prepended to this name to distinguish
  the field from standard fields.  This name must conform to the
  naming rules for the database server you use.
  
  <field description> is a short string describing the field.  It will
  be displayed to Bugzilla users in several parts of Bugzilla's UI,
  for example as the label for the field on the "show bug" page.

Warning:

  Custom fields can make Bugzilla less usable.  See this URL
  for alternatives to custom fields:
  
  http://www.gerv.net/hacking/custom-fields.html
  
  You should try to implement applicable alternatives before using
  this script to add a custom field.

# Exit gracefully if there is already a field with the given name.
if ( new Bugzilla::Field({name => $name}) ) {
    print "There is already a field named $name.  Please choose " .
          "a different name.\n";
    exit;
}


# Create the field.
print "Creating custom field $name ...\n";
my $field = Bugzilla::Field::create($name, $desc, 1);
