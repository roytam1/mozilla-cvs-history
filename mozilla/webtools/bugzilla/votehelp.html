<TITLE>Bugzilla Voting</TITLE>
<H1>Bugzilla Voting</H1>

Bugzilla has a "voting" feature.  Each product allows users to have a
certain number of votes.  (Some products may not allow any, which
means you can't vote on things in that product at all.) With your
vote, you indicate which bugs you think are the most important to be
fixed.

<p>

Depending on how the administrator has configured the relevant
product, you may be able to vote for the same bug more than one time.
But remember, you only have so many votes to use in total!  So, you
can either vote a little for many bugs, or vote a lot for a few bugs.

<p>

To look at votes:

<ul>
  <li> Go to the query page.  Do a normal query, but enter 1 in the
       "At least ___ votes" field.  This will show you items that
       match your query that have at least one vote.
</ul>

<p>

To vote for a bug:

<ul>
  <li> Bring up the bug in question.
  <li> Click on the "Vote for this bug" link that appears just above
       the "Additional Comments" field.  (If no such link appears,
       then voting may not be allowed in this bug's product.)
  <li> Indicate how many votes you want to give this bug.  This page
       also displays how many votes you've given to other bugs, so you
       may rebalance your votes as necessary.
</ul>

You will automatically get email notifying you of any changes that
occur on bugs you vote for.

<p>

You may review your votes at any time by clicking on the "Change your
password or preferences" link at the bottom of the query page.
