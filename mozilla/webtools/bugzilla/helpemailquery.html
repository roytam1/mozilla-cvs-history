<h1>Help on searching by email address.</h1>

<p>
This used to be simpler, but not very powerful.  Now it's really
powerful and useful, but it may not be obvious how to use it...
</p>

<p>
To search for bugs associated with an email address:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> Type a portion of an email address into the text field.</li>
  <li> Select which fields of the bug you expect that address to be in
       the bugs you're looking for.</li>
</ul>

<p>
You can look for up to two different email addresses; if you specify
both, then only bugs which match both will show up.  This is useful to
find bugs that were, for example, created by Ralph and assigned to
Fred.
</p>

<p>
You can also use the drop down menus to specify whether you want to
match addresses by doing a substring match, by using regular
expressions, or by exactly matching a fully specified email address.
