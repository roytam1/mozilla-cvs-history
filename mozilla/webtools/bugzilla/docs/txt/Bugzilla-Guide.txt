   Revision History
   Revision v2.11  20 December 2000 Revised by: MPB
   Converted the README, FAQ, and DATABASE information into SGML docbook
   format.
   Revision 2.11.1 06 March 2001    Revised by: MPB
   Took way too long to revise this for 2.12 release. Updated FAQ to use
   qandaset tags instead of literallayout, cleaned up administration
   section, added User Guide section, miscellaneous FAQ updates and
   third-party integration information. From this point on all new tags
   are lowercase in preparation for the 2.13 release of the Guide in XML
   format instead of SGML.
   Revision 2.12.0 24 April 2001    Revised by: MPB
   Things fixed this release: Elaborated on queryhelp interface, added
   FAQ regarding moving bugs from one keyword to another, clarified
   possible problems with the Landfill tutorial, fixed a boatload of
   typos and unclear sentence structures. Incorporated the README into
   the UNIX installation section, and changed the README to indicate the
   deprecated status. Things I know need work: Used "simplelist" a lot,
   where I should have used "procedure" to tag things. Need to lowercase
   all tags to be XML compliant.
   Revision 2.14.0 07 August 2001   Revised by: MPB
   Attempted to integrate relevant portions of the UNIX and Windows
   installation instructions, moved some data from FAQ to Install,
   removed references to README from text, added Mac OS X install
   instructions, fixed a bunch of tpyos (Mark Harig), linked text that
   referenced other parts of the Guide, and nuked the old MySQL
   permissions section.

   This is the documentation for Bugzilla, the Mozilla bug-tracking
   system.

   Bugzilla is an enterprise-class set of software utilities that, when
   used together, power issue-tracking for hundreds of organizations
   around the world, tracking millions of bugs. While it is easy to use
   and quite flexible, it is very difficult for a novice to install and
   maintain. Although we have provided step-by-step directions, Bugzilla
   is not always easy to get working. Please be sure the person
   responsible for installing and maintaining this software is a
   qualified professional on operating system upon which you install
   Bugzilla.

   THIS DOCUMENTATION IS MAINTAINED IN DOCBOOK 4.1 SGML FORMAT. IF YOU
   WISH TO MAKE CORRECTIONS, PLEASE MAKE THEM IN PLAIN TEXT OR SGML DIFFS
   AGAINST THE SOURCE. I CANNOT ACCEPT ADDITIONS TO THE GUIDE WRITTEN IN
   HTML!
