   This is the documentation for Bugzilla, the mozilla.org bug-tracking
   system. Bugzilla is an enterprise-class piece of software that powers
   issue-tracking for hundreds of organizations around the world,
   tracking millions of bugs.

   This documentation is maintained in DocBook 4.1.2 XML format. Changes
   are best submitted as plain text or XML diffs, attached to a bug filed
   in the Bugzilla Documentation component.

   This is a development version of this guide. Information in it is
   subject to change before the 2.18 release of this guide (which will
   correspond with the 2.18 release of Bugzilla).

Chapter 2. Introduction

2.1. What is Bugzilla?

   Bugzilla is a bug- or issue-tracking system. Bug-tracking systems
   allow individual or groups of developers effectively to keep track of
   outstanding problems with their product. Bugzilla was originally
   written by Terry Weissman in a programming language called TCL, to
   replace a rudimentary bug-tracking database used internally by
   Netscape Communications. Terry later ported Bugzilla to Perl from TCL,
   and in Perl it remains to this day. Most commercial defect-tracking
   software vendors at the time charged enormous licensing fees, and
   Bugzilla quickly became a favorite of the open-source crowd (with its
   genesis in the open-source browser project, Mozilla). It is now the
   de-facto standard defect-tracking system against which all others are
   measured.

   Bugzilla boasts many advanced features. These include:

     * Powerful searching
     * User-configurable email notifications of bug changes
     * Full change history
     * Inter-bug dependency tracking and graphing
     * Excellent attachment management
     * Integrated, product-based, granular security schema
     * Fully security-audited, and runs under Perl's taint mode
     * A robust, stable RDBMS back-end
     * Web, XML, email and console interfaces
     * Completely customisable and/or localisable web user interface
     * Extensive configurability
     * Smooth upgrade pathway between versions
     _________________________________________________________________

2.2. Why Should We Use Bugzilla?

   For many years, defect-tracking software has remained principally the
   domain of large software development houses. Even then, most shops
   never bothered with bug-tracking software, and instead simply relied
   on shared lists and email to monitor the status of defects. This
   procedure is error-prone and tends to cause those bugs judged least
   significant by developers to be dropped or ignored.

   These days, many companies are finding that integrated defect-tracking
   systems reduce downtime, increase productivity, and raise customer
   satisfaction with their systems. Along with full disclosure, an open
   bug-tracker allows manufacturers to keep in touch with their clients
   and resellers, to communicate about problems effectively throughout
   the data management chain. Many corporations have also discovered that
   defect-tracking helps reduce costs by providing IT support
   accountability, telephone support knowledge bases, and a common,
   well-understood system for accounting for unusual system or software
   issues.

   But why should you use Bugzilla?

   Bugzilla is very adaptable to various situations. Known uses currently
   include IT support queues, Systems Administration deployment
   management, chip design and development problem tracking (both
   pre-and-post fabrication), and software and hardware bug tracking for
   luminaries such as Redhat, NASA, Linux-Mandrake, and VA Systems.
   Combined with systems such as CVS, Bonsai, or Perforce SCM, Bugzilla
   provides a powerful, easy-to-use solution to configuration management
   and replication problems.

   Bugzilla can dramatically increase the productivity and accountability
   of individual employees by providing a documented workflow and
   positive feedback for good performance. How many times do you wake up
   in the morning, remembering that you were supposed to do something
   today, but you just can't quite remember? Put it in Bugzilla, and you
   have a record of it from which you can extrapolate milestones, predict
   product versions for integration, and follow the discussion trail that
   led to critical decisions.

   Ultimately, Bugzilla puts the power in your hands to improve your
   value to your employer or business while providing a usable framework
   for your natural attention to detail and knowledge store to flourish.

Chapter 3. Using Bugzilla

3.1. How do I use Bugzilla?

   This section contains information for end-users of Bugzilla. There is
   a Bugzilla test installation, called Landfill, which you are welcome
   to play with (if it's up.) However, it does not necessarily have all
   Bugzilla features enabled, and often runs cutting-edge versions of
   Bugzilla for testing, so some things may work slightly differently
   than mentioned here.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.1.1. Create a Bugzilla Account

   If you want to use Bugzilla, first you need to create an account.
   Consult with the administrator responsible for your installation of
   Bugzilla for the URL you should use to access it. If you're
   test-driving Bugzilla, use this URL:
   http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/.

    1. Click the "Open a new Bugzilla account" link, enter your email
       address and, optionally, your name in the spaces provided, then
       click "Create Account" .
    2. Within moments, you should receive an email to the address you
       provided above, which contains your login name (generally the same
       as the email address), and a password you can use to access your
       account. This password is randomly generated, and can be changed
       to something more memorable.
    3. Click the "Log In" link in the yellow area at the bottom of the
       page in your browser, enter your email address and password into
       the spaces provided, and click "Login".

   You are now logged in. Bugzilla uses cookies for authentication so,
   unless your IP address changes, you should not have to log in again.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.1.2. Anatomy of a Bug

   The core of Bugzilla is the screen which displays a particular bug.
   It's a good place to explain some Bugzilla concepts. Bug 1 on Landfill
   is a good example. Note that the labels for most fields are
   hyperlinks; clicking them will take you to context-sensitive help on
   that particular field. Fields marked * may not be present on every
   installation of Bugzilla.

    1. Product and Component: Bugs are divided up by Product and
       Component, with a Product having one or more Components in it. For
       example, bugzilla.mozilla.org's "Bugzilla" Product is composed of
       several Components:

       Administration: Administration of a Bugzilla installation.
       Bugzilla-General: Anything that doesn't fit in the other components,
       or spans multiple components.
       Creating/Changing Bugs: Creating, changing, and viewing bugs.
       Documentation: The Bugzilla documentation, including The Bugzilla
       Guide.
       Email: Anything to do with email sent by Bugzilla.
       Installation: The installation process of Bugzilla.
       Query/Buglist: Anything to do with searching for bugs and viewing the
       buglists.
       Reporting/Charting: Getting reports from Bugzilla.
       User Accounts: Anything about managing a user account from the user's
       perspective. Saved queries, creating accounts, changing passwords,
       logging in, etc.
       User Interface: General issues having to do with the user interface
       cosmetics (not functionality) including cosmetic issues, HTML
       templates, etc.
    2. Status and Resolution: These define exactly what state the bug is
       in - from not even being confirmed as a bug, through to being
       fixed and the fix confirmed by Quality Assurance. The different
       possible values for Status and Resolution on your installation
       should be documented in the context-sensitive help for those
       items.
    3. Assigned To: The person responsible for fixing the bug.
    4. *URL: A URL associated with the bug, if any.
    5. Summary: A one-sentence summary of the problem.
    6. *Status Whiteboard: (a.k.a. Whiteboard) A free-form text area for
       adding short notes and tags to a bug.
    7. *Keywords: The administrator can define keywords which you can use
       to tag and categorise bugs - e.g. The Mozilla Project has keywords
       like crash and regression.
    8. Platform and OS: These indicate the computing environment where
       the bug was found.
    9. Version: The "Version" field is usually used for versions of a
       product which have been released, and is set to indicate which
       versions of a Component have the particular problem the bug report
       is about.
   10. Priority: The bug assignee uses this field to prioritise his or
       her bugs. It's a good idea not to change this on other people's
       bugs.
   11. Severity: This indicates how severe the problem is - from blocker
       ("application unusable") to trivial ("minor cosmetic issue"). You
       can also use this field to indicate whether a bug is an
       enhancement request.
   12. *Target: (a.k.a. Target Milestone) A future version by which the
       bug is to be fixed. e.g. The Bugzilla Project's milestones for
       future Bugzilla versions are 2.18, 2.20, 3.0, etc. Milestones are
       not restricted to numbers, thought - you can use any text strings,
       such as dates.
   13. Reporter: The person who filed the bug.
   14. CC list: A list of people who get mail when the bug changes.
   15. Attachments: You can attach files (e.g. testcases or patches) to
       bugs. If there are any attachments, they are listed in this
       section.
   16. *Dependencies: If this bug cannot be fixed unless other bugs are
       fixed (depends on), or this bug stops other bugs being fixed
       (blocks), their numbers are recorded here.
   17. *Votes: Whether this bug has any votes.
   18. Additional Comments: You can add your two cents to the bug
       discussion here, if you have something worthwhile to say.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.1.3. Searching for Bugs

   The Bugzilla Search page is is the interface where you can find any
   bug report, comment, or patch currently in the Bugzilla system. You
   can play with it here:
   http://landfill.bugzilla.org/bugzilla-tip/query.cgi.

   The Search page has controls for selecting different possible values
   for all of the fields in a bug, as described above. For some fields,
   multiple values can be selected. In those cases, Bugzilla returns bugs
   where the content of the field matches one of the selected values. If
   none is selected, then the field can take any value.

   Once you've defined a search, you can either run it, or save it as a
   Remembered Query, which can optionally appear in the footer of your
   pages.

   Highly advanced querying is done using Boolean Charts.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.1.4. Bug Lists

   If you run a search, a list of matching bugs will be returned. The
   default search is to return all open bugs on the system - don't try
   running this search on a Bugzilla installation with a lot of bugs!

   The format of the list is configurable. For example, it can be sorted
   by clicking the column headings. Other useful features can be accessed
   using the links at the bottom of the list:

   Long Format: this gives you a large page with a non-editable summary
   of the fields of each bug.
   Change Columns: change the bug attributes which appear in the list.
   Change several bugs at once: If your account is sufficiently
   empowered, you can make the same change to all the bugs in the list -
   for example, changing their owner.
   Send mail to bug owners: Sends mail to the owners of all bugs on the
   list.
   Edit this query: If you didn't get exactly the results you were
   looking for, you can return to the Query page through this link and
   make small revisions to the query you just made so you get more
   accurate results.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.1.5. Filing Bugs

   Years of bug writing experience has been distilled for your reading
   pleasure into the Bug Writing Guidelines. While some of the advice is
   Mozilla-specific, the basic principles of reporting Reproducible,
   Specific bugs, isolating the Product you are using, the Version of the
   Product, the Component which failed, the Hardware Platform, and
   Operating System you were using at the time of the failure go a long
   way toward ensuring accurate, responsible fixes for the bug that bit
   you.

   The procedure for filing a test bug is as follows:

    1. Go to Landfill in your browser and click Enter a new bug report.
    2. Select a product - any one will do.
    3. Fill in the fields. Bugzilla should have made reasonable guesses,
       based upon your browser, for the "Platform" and "OS" drop-down
       boxes. If they are wrong, change them.
    4. Select "Commit" and send in your bug report.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2. Hints and Tips

   This section distills some Bugzilla tips and best practices that have
   been developed.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.1. Autolinkification

   Bugzilla comments are plain text - so posting HTML will result in
   literal HTML tags rather than being interpreted by a browser. However,
   Bugzilla will automatically make hyperlinks out of certain sorts of
   text in comments. For example, the text http://www.bugzilla.org will
   be turned into http://www.bugzilla.org. Other strings which get
   linkified in the obvious manner are:

   bug 12345
   bug 23456, comment 53
   attachment 4321
   mailto:george@example.com
   george@example.com
   ftp://ftp.mozilla.org
   Most other sorts of URL

   A corollary here is that if you type a bug number in a comment, you
   should put the word "bug" before it, so it gets autolinkified for the
   convenience of others.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.2. Quicksearch

   Quicksearch is a single-text-box query tool which uses metacharacters
   to indicate what is to be searched. For example, typing "foo|bar" into
   Quicksearch would search for "foo" or "bar" in the summary and status
   whiteboard of a bug; adding ":BazProduct" would search only in that
   product.

   You'll find the Quicksearch box on Bugzilla's front page, along with a
   Help link which details how to use it.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.3. Comments

   If you are changing the fields on a bug, only comment if either you
   have something pertinent to say, or Bugzilla requires it. Otherwise,
   you may spam people unnecessarily with bug mail. To take an example: a
   user can set up their account to filter out messages where someone
   just adds themselves to the CC field of a bug (which happens a lot.)
   If you come along, add yourself to the CC field, and add a comment
   saying "Adding self to CC", then that person gets a pointless piece of
   mail they would otherwise have avoided.

   Don't use sigs in comments. Signing your name ("Bill") is acceptable,
   particularly if you do it out of habit, but full mail/news-style four
   line ASCII art creations are not.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.4. Attachments

   Use attachments, rather than comments, for large chunks of ASCII data,
   such as trace, debugging output files, or log files. That way, it
   doesn't bloat the bug for everyone who wants to read it, and cause
   people to receive fat, useless mails.

   Trim screenshots. There's no need to show the whole screen if you are
   pointing out a single-pixel problem.

   Don't attach simple test cases (e.g. one HTML file, one CSS file and
   an image) as a ZIP file. Instead, upload them in reverse order and
   edit the referring file so that they point to the attached files. This
   way, the test case works immediately out of the bug.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.2.5. Filing Bugs

   Try to make sure that everything said in the summary is also said in
   the first comment. Summaries are often updated and this will ensure
   your original information is easily accessible.

   You do not need to put "any" or similar strings in the URL field. If
   there is no specific URL associated with the bug, leave this field
   blank.

   If you feel a bug you filed was incorrectly marked as a DUPLICATE of
   another, please question it in your bug, not the bug it was duped to.
   Feel free to CC the person who duped it if they are not already CCed.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3. User Preferences

   Once you have logged in, you can customise various aspects of Bugzilla
   via the "Edit prefs" link in the page footer. The preferences are
   split into four tabs:
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3.1. Account Settings

   On this tab, you can change your basic account information, including
   your password, email address and real name. For security reasons, in
   order to change anything on this page you must type your current
   password into the "Password" field at the top of the page. If you
   attempt to change your email address, a confirmation email is sent to
   both the old and new addresses, with a link to use to confirm the
   change. This helps to prevent account hijacking.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3.2. Email Settings

   On this tab you can reduce or increase the amount of email sent you
   from Bugzilla, opting in our out depending on your relationship to the
   bug and the change that was made to it. (Note that you can also do
   client-side filtering using the X-Bugzilla-Reason header which
   Bugzilla adds to all bugmail.)

   By entering user email names, delineated by commas, into the "Users to
   watch" text entry box you can receive a copy of all the bugmail of
   other users (security settings permitting.) This powerful
   functionality enables seamless transitions as developers change
   projects or users go on holiday.

   Note

        The ability to watch other users may not be available in all Bugzilla
        installations. If you can't see it, ask your administrator.

3.3.3. Page Footer

   On the Search page, you can store queries in Bugzilla, so if you
   regularly run a particular query it is just a drop-down menu away.
   Once you have a stored query, you can come here to request that it
   also be displayed in your page footer.
     _________________________________________________________________

3.3.4. Permissions

   This is a purely informative page which outlines your current
   permissions on this installation of Bugzilla - what product groups you
   are in, and whether you can edit bugs or perform various
   administration functions.
     _________________________________________________________________

Chapter 4. Installation

4.1. Step-by-step Install

   Bugzilla has been successfully installed under many different
   operating systems including almost all Unix clones and Microsoft
   Windows. Many operating systems have utilities that make installation
   easier or quirks that make it harder. We have tried to collect that
   information in Section 4.3, so be sure to check out that section
   before you start your installation.

   Note

        Windows is one of those operating systems that has many quirks and is
        not yet officially supported by the Bugzilla team. If you wish to
        install Bugzilla on Windows, be sure to see Section 4.3.1.

 Warning

         While installing Bugzilla, it is a good idea to ensure that there is
         some kind of firewall between you and the rest of the Internet as your
         machine may be insecure for periods during the install. Many
         installation steps require an active Internet connection to complete,
         but you must take care to ensure that at no point is your machine
         vulnerable to an attack.

   This guide assumes that you already have your operating system
   installed, network configured, and have administrative access to the
   shell on the machine you are installing Bugzilla onto. It is possible
   to install and run Bugzilla without administrative access, but you
   have to either make sure all the required software is installed or get
   somebody with administrative access to install it for you.

   The listing below is a basic step-by-step list. More information can
   be found in the sections below. Minimum versions will be included in
   parenthesis where appropriate.
    1. Install MySQL (3.23.41)
    2. Install Perl (5.6)
    3. Install Perl Modules
    4. Install a Webserver
    5. Put Bugzilla in the Webspace
    6. Setup the MySQL Database
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.1. MySQL

   Visit the MySQL homepage at http://www.mysql.com to grab and install
   the latest stable release of the server.

   Note

        Many of the binary versions of MySQL store their data files in /var.
        On some Unix systems, this is part of a smaller root partition, and
        may not have room for your bug database. You can set the data
        directory as an option to configure if you build MySQL from source
        yourself.

   If you install from something other than a packaging/installation
   system (such as .rpm, .dep, .exe, or .msi) you will need to configure
   your system so the MySQL server daemon will come back up whenever your
   machine reboots.

   If you wish to have attachments larger than 64K, you will have to
   configure MySQL to accept large packets. This is done by adding the
   text in Figure 4-1 to your my.conf file. There is also a parameter in
   Bugzilla for setting the maximum allowable attachment size. You should
   set this value to be slightly larger than that parameter.

   Figure 4-1. Set Max Packet Size in MySQL
   [mysqld]
   # Allow packets up to 1M
   set-variable = max_allowed_packet=1M

   If you are running Bugzilla and MySQL on the same machine, you may
   also wish to utilize the skip-networking option as mentioned in
   Section 5.6.2 for the added security.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.2. Perl

   Any machine that doesn't have Perl on it is a sad machine indeed. Perl
   can be got in source form from http://www.perl.com. There are also
   binary versions available for many platforms, most of which are linked
   to from perl.com. Although Bugzilla runs with perl 5.6, it's a good
   idea to be up to the very latest version if you can when running
   Bugzilla. As of this writing, that is Perl version 5.8.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3. Perl Modules

   Perl modules can be found using CPAN on Unix based systems or PPM on
   Win32. The root servers have a real tendency to bog down, so please
   use mirrors.

   Good instuctions can be found for using each of these services on
   their respective websites. The basics can be found in Example 4-1 for
   CPAN and Section 4.3.1.2 for PPM.

   Example 4-1. Installing perl modules with CPAN

   The easy way:
   bash# perl -MCPAN -e 'install "<modulename>"'

   Or the hard way:
   bash# tar xzvf <module>.tar.gz      (1)
   bash# cd <module>                   (2)
   bash# perl Makefile.PL
   bash# make
   bash# make test
   bash# make install

   (1)
          This assumes that you've already downloaded the <module>.tar.gz
          to the current working directory.
   (2)
          The process of untaring the module as defined in (1) will
          create the <module> directory.

   Tip

       Many people complain that Perl modules will not install for them. Most
       times, the error messages complain that they are missing a file in
       "@INC". Virtually every time, this error is due to permissions being
       set too restrictively for you to compile Perl modules or not having
       the necessary Perl development libraries installed on your system.
       Consult your local UNIX systems administrator for help solving these
       permissions issues; if you are the local UNIX sysadmin, please consult
       the newsgroup/mailing list for further assistance or hire someone to
       help you out.

   Perl Modules (minimum version):

    1. Bundle::Bugzilla (Will allow you to skip the rest)
    2. AppConfig (1.52)
    3. CGI (2.88)
    4. Data::Dumper (any)
    5. Date::Format (2.21)
    6. DBI (1.32)
    7. DBD::mysql (2.1010)
    8. File::Spec (0.82)
    9. File::Temp (any)
   10. Template Toolkit (2.08)
   11. Text::Wrap (2001.0131)

   and, optionally:

    1. GD (1.20) for bug charting
    2. Chart::Base (0.99c) for bug charting
    3. XML::Parser (any) for the XML interface
    4. GD::Graph (any) for bug charting

    6. MIME::Parser (any) for the email interface
    7. PatchReader (0.9.1) for pretty HTML view of patches
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3.1. Bundle::Bugzilla

   If you are running at least perl 5.6.1, you can save yourself a lot of
   time by using Bundle::Bugzilla. This bundle contains every module
   required to get Bugzilla running. It does not include GD and friends,
   but these are not required for a base install and can always be added
   later if the need arises.

   Assuming your perl was installed with CPAN (most unix installations
   are), using Bundle::Bugzilla is really easy. Simply follow along with
   the commands below.
   bash# perl -MCPAN -eshell               (1)
   cpan shell -- CPAN exploration and modules installation (v1.63)
   ReadLine support enabled

   cpan>


   (1)
          At this point, unless you've used CPAN on this machine before,
          you'll have to go through a series of configuration steps.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3.2. AppConfig (1.52)

   Dependency for Template Toolkit. We probably don't need to
   specifically check for it anymore.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3.3. CGI (2.88)

   The CGI module parses form elements and cookies and does many other
   usefule things. It come as a part of recent perl distributions, but
   Bugzilla needs a fairly new version.

     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3.4. Data::Dumper (any)

   The Data::Dumper module provides data structure persistence for Perl
   (similar to Java's serialization). It comes with later sub-releases of
   Perl 5.004, but a re-installation just to be sure it's available won't
   hurt anything.

4.1.3.5. TimeDate modules (2.21)

   Many of the more common date/time/calendar related Perl modules have
   been grouped into a bundle similar to the MySQL modules bundle. This
   bundle is stored on the CPAN under the name TimeDate. The component
   module we're most interested in is the Date::Format module, but
   installing all of them is probably a good idea anyway.

     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3.6. DBI (1.32)

   The DBI module is a generic Perl module used the MySQL-related
   modules. As long as your Perl installation was done correctly the DBI
   module should be a breeze. It's a mixed Perl/C module, but Perl's
   MakeMaker system simplifies the C compilation greatly.

           Documentation: http://dbi.perl.org/doc/
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3.7. MySQL-related modules

   The Perl/MySQL interface requires a few mutually-dependent Perl
   modules. These modules are grouped together into the the
   Msql-Mysql-modules package.

   The MakeMaker process will ask you a few questions about the desired
   compilation target and your MySQL installation. For most of the
   questions the provided default will be adequate, but when asked if
   your desired target is the MySQL or mSQL packages, you should select
   the MySQL related ones. Later you will be asked if you wish to provide
   backwards compatibility with the older MySQL packages; you should
   answer YES to this question. The default is NO.

   A host of 'localhost' should be fine and a testing user of 'test' with
   a null password should find itself with sufficient access to run tests
   on the 'test' database which MySQL created upon installation.

4.1.3.8. File::Spec (0.82)

   File::Spec is a perl module that allows file operations, such as
   generating full path names, to work cross platform.

4.1.3.10. Template Toolkit (2.08)

   When you install Template Toolkit, you'll get asked various questions
   about features to enable. The defaults are fine, except that it is
   recommended you use the high speed XS Stash of the Template Toolkit,
   in order to achieve best performance.

     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3.12. GD (1.20) [optional]

   The GD library was written by Thomas Boutell a long while ago to
   programmatically generate images in C. Since then it's become the
   defacto standard for programmatic image construction. The Perl
   bindings to it found in the GD library are used on millions of web
   pages to generate graphs on the fly. That's what Bugzilla will be
   using it for so you must install it if you want any of the graphing to
   work.

   Note

        The Perl GD library requires some other libraries that may or may not
        be installed on your system, including libpng and libgd. The full
        requirements are listed in the Perl GD library README. If compiling GD
        fails, it's probably because you're missing a required library.

   Tip

       The version of the GD perl module you need is very closely tied to the
       libgd version installed on your system. If you have a version 1.x of
       libgd the 2.x versions of the GD perl module won't work for you.

     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3.13. Chart::Base (0.99c) [optional]

   The Chart module provides Bugzilla with on-the-fly charting abilities.
   It can be installed in the usual fashion after it has been fetched
   from CPAN. Note that earlier versions that 0.99c used GIFs, which are
   no longer supported by the latest versions of GD.

4.1.3.14. XML::Parser (any) [Optional]

   XML::Parser is used by the importxml.pl script. You only need it if
   you are going to be importing bugs (such as for bug moving).
   XML::Parser requires that the expat library is already installed on
   your machine.

     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.3.15. GD::Graph (any) [Optional]

   In addition to GD listed above, the reporting interface of Bugzilla
   needs to have the GD::Graph module installed.

4.1.3.16. GD::Text::Align (any) [Optional]

   GD::Text::Align, as the name implies, is used to draw aligned strings
   of text. It is needed by the reporting interface.

4.1.3.18. PatchReader (0.9.1) [Optional]

   PatchReader is only needed if you want to use Patch Viewer, a Bugzilla
   feature to format patches in a pretty HTML fashion. There are a number
   of optional parameters you can configure Patch Viewer with as well,
   including cvsroot, cvsroot_get, lxr_root, bonsai_url, lxr_url, and
   lxr_root. Patch Viewer also optionally will use cvs, diff and
   interdiff utilities if they exist on the system (interdiff can be
   found in the patchutils package at
   http://cyberelk.net/tim/patchutils/. These programs' locations can be
   configured in localconfig.

     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.4. HTTP Server

   You have freedom of choice here, pretty much any web server that is
   capable of running CGI scripts will work. Section 4.4 has more
   information about configuring web servers to work with Bugzilla.

   Note

        We strongly recommend Apache as the web server to use. The Bugzilla
        Guide installation instructions, in general, assume you are using
        Apache. If you have got Bugzilla working using another webserver,
        please share your experiences with us by filing a bug in Bugzilla
        Documentation.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.5. Bugzilla

   You should untar the Bugzilla files into a directory that you're
   willing to make writable by the default web server user (probably
   "nobody"). You may decide to put the files in the main web space for
   your web server or perhaps in /usr/local with a symbolic link in the
   web space that points to the Bugzilla directory.

   Tip

       If you symlink the bugzilla directory into your Apache's HTML
       hierarchy, you may receive Forbidden errors unless you add the
       "FollowSymLinks" directive to the <Directory> entry for the HTML root
       in httpd.conf.

   Once all the files are in a web accessible directory, make that
   directory writable by your webserver's user. This is a temporary step
   until you run the post-install checksetup.pl script, which locks down
   your installation.

  Caution

          The default Bugzilla distribution is not designed to be placed in a
          cgi-bin directory (this includes any directory which is configured
          using the ScriptAlias directive of Apache). This will probably change
          as part of bug 44659.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.6. Setting Up the MySQL Database

   After you've gotten all the software installed and working you're
   ready to start preparing the database for its life as the back end to
   a high quality bug tracker.

   This first thing you'll want to do is make sure you've given the
   "root" user a password as suggested in Section 5.6.2. For clarity,
   these instructions will assume that your MySQL user for Bugzilla will
   be "bugs_user", the database will be called "bugs_db" and the password
   for the "bugs_user" user is "bugs_password". You should, of course,
   substitute the values you intend to use for your site.

   Note

        Most people use "bugs" for both the user and database name.

   Next, we use an SQL GRANT command to create a "bugs_user" user, and
   grant sufficient permissions for checksetup.pl, which we'll use later,
   to work its magic. This also restricts the "bugs_user" user to
   operations within a database called "bugs_db", and only allows the
   account to connect from "localhost". Modify it to reflect your setup
   if you will be connecting from another machine or as a different user.
   mysql> GRANT SELECT,INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,INDEX,ALTER,CREATE,
          DROP,REFERENCES ON bugs_db.* TO bugs_user@localhost
          IDENTIFIED BY 'bugs_password';
   mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

   Note

        If you are using MySQL 4, the bugs user also needs to be granted the
        LOCK TABLES and CREATE TEMPORARY TABLES permissions.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.7. checksetup.pl

   Next, run the magic checksetup.pl script. (Many thanks to Holger
   Schurig for writing this script!) This script is designed to make sure
   your perl modules are the correct version and your MySQL database and
   other configuration options are consistent with the Bugzilla CGI
   files. It will make sure Bugzilla files and directories have
   reasonable permissions, set up the data directory, and create all the
   MySQL tables.
   bash# ./checksetup.pl

   The first time you run it, it will create a file called localconfig.

   This file contains a variety of settings you may need to tweak
   including how Bugzilla should connect to the MySQL database.

   The connection settings include:

    1. server's host: just use "localhost" if the MySQL server is local
    2. database name: "bugs_db" if you're following these directions
    3. MySQL username: "bugs_user" if you're following these directions
    4. Password for the "bugs_user" MySQL account; ("bugs_password"
       above)

   Once you are happy with the settings, su to the user your web server
   runs as, and re-run checksetup.pl. (Note: on some security-conscious
   systems, you may need to change the login shell for the webserver
   account before you can do this.) On this second run, it will create
   the database and an administrator account for which you will be
   prompted to provide information.

   Note

        The checksetup.pl script is designed so that you can run it at any
        time without causing harm. You should run it after any upgrade to
        Bugzilla.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.1.8. Configuring Bugzilla

   You should run through the parameters on the Edit Parameters page
   (link in the footer) and set them all to appropriate values. They key
   parameters are documented in Section 5.1.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2. Optional Additional Configuration

4.2.1. Dependency Charts

   As well as the text-based dependency graphs, Bugzilla also supports
   dependency graphing, using a package called 'dot'. Exactly how this
   works is controlled by the 'webdotbase' parameter, which can have one
   of three values:

    1. A complete file path to the command 'dot' (part of GraphViz) will
       generate the graphs locally
    2. A URL prefix pointing to an installation of the webdot package
       will generate the graphs remotely
    3. A blank value will disable dependency graphing.

   So, to get this working, install GraphViz. If you do that, you need to
   enable server-side image maps in Apache. Alternatively, you could set
   up a webdot server, or use the AT&T public webdot server (the default
   for the webdotbase param). Note that AT&T's server won't work if
   Bugzilla is only accessible using HARTS.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2.2. Bug Graphs

   As long as you installed the GD and Graph::Base Perl modules you might
   as well turn on the nifty Bugzilla bug reporting graphs.

   Add a cron entry like this to run collectstats.pl daily at 5 after
   midnight:

   bash# crontab -e
   5 0 * * * cd <your-bugzilla-directory> ; ./collectstats.pl

   After two days have passed you'll be able to view bug graphs from the
   Bug Reports page.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2.3. The Whining Cron

   By now you have a fully functional Bugzilla, but what good are bugs if
   they're not annoying? To help make those bugs more annoying you can
   set up Bugzilla's automatic whining system to complain at engineers
   which leave their bugs in the NEW state without triaging them.

   This can be done by adding the following command as a daily crontab
   entry (for help on that see that crontab man page):

   cd <your-bugzilla-directory> ; ./whineatnews.pl

   Tip   

          Depending on your system, crontab may have several manpages. The
          following command should lead you to the most useful page for this
          purpose:

       man 5 crontab

4.2.4. LDAP Authentication

   Note

        LDAP authentication has been rewritten for the 2.18 release of
        Bugzilla. It no longer requires the Mozilla::LDAP module and now uses
        Net::LDAP instead. This rewrite was part of a larger landing that
        allowed for additional authentication schemes to be easily added (bug
        180642).

        This patch originally landed in 21-Mar-2003 and was included in the
        2.17.4 development release.

   The existing authentication scheme for Bugzilla uses email addresses
   as the primary user ID, and a password to authenticate that user. All
   places within Bugzilla where you need to deal with user ID (e.g
   assigning a bug) use the email address. The LDAP authentication builds
   on top of this scheme, rather than replacing it. The initial log in is
   done with a username and password for the LDAP directory. This then
   fetches the email address from LDAP and authenticates seamlessly in
   the standard Bugzilla authentication scheme using this email address.
   If an account for this address already exists in your Bugzilla system,
   it will log in to that account. If no account for that email address
   exists, one is created at the time of login. (In this case, Bugzilla
   will attempt to use the "displayName" or "cn" attribute to determine
   the user's full name.) After authentication, all other user-related
   tasks are still handled by email address, not LDAP username. You still
   assign bugs by email address, query on users by email address, etc.

  Caution

          Because the Bugzilla account is not created until the first time a
          user logs in, a user who has not yet logged is unknown to Bugzilla.
          This means they cannot be used as an assignee or QA contact (default
          or otherwise), added to any cc list, or any other such operation. One
          possible workaround is the bugzilla_ldapsync.rb script in the contrib
          directory. Another possible solution is fixing bug 201069.

   Parameters required to use LDAP Authentication:

   loginmethod
          This parameter should be set to "LDAP" only if you will be
          using an LDAP directory for authentication. If you set this
          param to "LDAP" but fail to set up the other parameters listed
          below you will not be able to log back in to Bugzilla one you
          log out. If this happens to you, you will need to manually edit
          data/params and set loginmethod to "DB".

   LDAPserver
          This parameter should be set to the name (and optionally the
          port) of your LDAP server. If no port is specified, it assumes
          the default LDAP port of 389.

          Ex. "ldap.company.com" or "ldap.company.com:3268"

   LDAPbinddn [Optional]
          Some LDAP servers will not allow an anonymous bind to search
          the directory. If this is the case with your configuration you
          should set the LDAPbinddn parameter to the user account
          Bugzilla should use instead of the anonymous bind.

          Ex. "cn=default,cn=user:password"

   LDAPBaseDN
          The LDAPBaseDN parameter should be set to the location in your
          LDAP tree that you would like to search for e-mail addresses.
          Your uids should be unique under the DN specified here.

          Ex. "ou=People,o=Company"

   LDAPuidattribute
          The LDAPuidattribute parameter should be set to the attribute
          which contains the unique UID of your users. The value
          retrieved from this attribute will be used when attempting to
          bind as the user to confirm their password.

          Ex. "uid"

   LDAPmailattribute
          The LDAPmailattribute parameter should be the name of the
          attribute which contains the e-mail address your users will
          enter into the Bugzilla login boxes.

          Ex. "mail"
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2.5. Preventing untrusted Bugzilla content from executing malicious
Javascript code

   It is possible for a Bugzilla to execute malicious Javascript code.
   Due to internationalization concerns, we are unable to incorporate the
   code changes necessary to fulfill the CERT advisory requirements
   mentioned in
   http://www.cert.org/tech_tips/malicious_code_mitigation.html/#3.
   Making the change below will fix the problem if your installation is
   for an English speaking audience.

   Telling Bugzilla to output a charset as part of the HTTP header is
   much easier in version 2.18 and higher (including any cvs pull after
   4-May-2003 and development release after 2.17.5) than it was in
   previous versions. Simply locate the following line in
   Bugzilla/CGI.pm:
       # Make sure that we don't send any charset headers
       $self->charset('');

   and change it to:
       # Send all data using the ISO-8859-1 charset
       $self->charset('ISO-8859-1');

   Note

        Using <meta> tags to set the charset is not recommended, as there's a
        bug in Netscape 4.x which causes pages marked up in this way to load
        twice. See bug 126266 for more information including progress toward
        making bugzilla charset aware by default.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2.6. directoryindex for the Bugzilla default page.

   You should modify the <DirectoryIndex> parameter for the Apache
   virtual host running your Bugzilla installation to allow index.cgi as
   the index page for a directory, as well as the usual index.html,
   index.htm, and so forth.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2.7. Bugzilla and mod_perl

   Bugzilla is unsupported under mod_perl. Effort is underway to make it
   work cleanly in a mod_perl environment, but it is slow going.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.2.8. mod_throttle and Security

   It is possible for a user, by mistake or on purpose, to access the
   database many times in a row which can result in very slow access
   speeds for other users. If your Bugzilla installation is experiencing
   this problem , you may install the Apache module mod_throttle which
   can limit connections by ip-address. You may download this module at
   http://www.snert.com/Software/mod_throttle/. Follow the instructions
   to install into your Apache install. This module only functions with
   the Apache web server! You may use the ThrottleClientIP command
   provided by this module to accomplish this goal. See the Module
   Instructions for more information.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3. OS Specific Installation Notes

   Many aspects of the Bugzilla installation can be affected by the the
   operating system you choose to install it on. Sometimes it can be made
   easier and others more difficult. This section will attempt to help
   you understand both the difficulties of running on specific operating
   systems and the utilities available to make it easier.

   If you have anything to add or notes for an operating system not
   covered, please file a bug in Bugzilla Documentation.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3.1. Microsoft Windows

   Making Bugzilla work on windows is still a very painful processes. The
   Bugzilla Team is working to make it easier, but that goal is not
   considered a top priority. If you wish to run Bugzilla, we still
   recommend doing so on a Unix based system such as GNU/Linux. As of
   this writing, all members of the Bugzilla team and all known large
   installations run on Unix based systems.

   If after hearing all that, you have enough pain tolerance to attempt
   installing Bugzilla on Win32, here are some pointers. Because this is
   a development version of the guide, these instructions are subject to
   change without notice. In fact, the Bugzilla Team hopes they do as we
   would like to have Bugzilla resonabally close to "out of the box"
   compatibility by the 2.18 release.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3.1.1. Win32 Perl

   Perl for Windows can be obtained from ActiveState. You should be able
   to find a compiled binary at
   http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Downloads/ActivePerl/.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3.1.2. Perl Modules on Win32

   Bugzilla on Windows requires the same perl modules found in Section
   4.1.3. The main difference is that windows uses PPM instead of CPAN.
   C:\perl> ppm <module name>

   Note

        The above syntax should work for all modules with the exception of
        Template Toolkit. The Template Toolkit website suggests using the
        instructions on OpenInteract's website.

   Tip

       A complete list of modules that can be installed using ppm can be
       found at http://www.activestate.com/PPMPackages/5.6plus.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3.1.3. Code changes required to run on win32

   Unfortunately, Bugzilla still doesn't run "out of the box" on Windows.
   There is work in progress to make this easier, but until that happens
   code will have to be modified. This section is an attempt to list the
   required changes. It is an attempt to be all inclusive, but there may
   be other changes required. If you find something is missing, please
   file a bug in Bugzilla Documentation.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3.1.3.1. Changes to checksetup.pl

   In checksetup.pl, the line reading:
   my $mysql_binaries = `which mysql`;

   to
   my $mysql_binaries = "D:\\mysql\\bin\\mysql";

   And you'll also need to change:
   my $webservergid = getgrnam($my_webservergroup)

   to
   my $webservergid = '8'
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3.1.3.2. Changes to BugMail.pm

   To make bug e-mail work on Win32 (until bug 84876 lands), the simplest
   way is to have Net::SMTP installed and change this (in
   Bugzilla/BugMail.pm):
   open(SENDMAIL, "|/usr/lib/sendmail $sendmailparam -t -i") ||
     die "Can't open sendmail";

   print SENDMAIL trim($msg) . "\n";
   close SENDMAIL;

   to
   use Net::SMTP;
   my $smtp_server = 'smtp.mycompany.com';  # change this

   # Use die on error, so that the mail will be in the 'unsent mails' and
   # can be sent from the sanity check page.
   my $smtp = Net::SMTP->new($smtp_server) ||
     die 'Cannot connect to server \'$smtp_server\'';

   $smtp->mail('bugzilla-daemon@mycompany.com');  # change this
   $smtp->to($person);
   $smtp->data();
   $smtp->datasend($msg);
   $smtp->dataend();
   $smtp->quit;

   Don't forget to change the name of your SMTP server and the domain of
   the sending e-mail address (after the '@') in the above lines of code.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3.1.4. Serving the web pages

   As is the case on Unix based systems, any web server should be able to
   handle Bugzilla; however, the Bugzilla Team still recommends Apache
   whenever asked. No matter what web server you choose, be sure to pay
   attention to the security notes in Section 5.6.4. More information on
   configuring specific web servers can be found in Section 4.4.

   Note

        If using Apache on windows, you can set the ScriptInterpreterSource
        directive in your Apache config, if you don't do this, you'll have to
        modify the first line of every script to contain your path to perl
        instead of /usr/bin/perl.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3.2. Mac OS X

   There are a lot of common libraries and utilities out there that Apple
   did not include with Mac OS X, but which run perfectly well on it. The
   GD library, which Bugzilla needs to do bug graphs, is one of these.

   The easiest way to get a lot of these is with a program called Fink,
   which is similar in nature to the CPAN installer, but installs common
   GNU utilities. Fink is available from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/.

   Follow the instructions for setting up Fink. Once it's installed,
   you'll want to use it to install the gd2 package.

   It will prompt you for a number of dependencies, type 'y' and hit
   enter to install all of the dependencies and then watch it work. You
   will then be able to use CPAN to install the GD perl module.

   Note

        To prevent creating conflicts with the software that Apple installs by
        default, Fink creates its own directory tree at /sw where it installs
        most of the software that it installs. This means your libraries and
        headers be at /sw/lib and /sw/include instead of /usr/lib and
        /usr/local/include. When the Perl module config script asks where your
        libgd is, be sure to tell it /sw/lib.

   Also available via Fink is expat. Once running using fink to install
   the expat package you will be able to install XML::Parser using CPAN.
   There is one caveat. Unlike recent versions of the GD module,
   XML::Parser doesn't prompt for the location of the required libraries.
   When using CPAN, you will need to use the following command sequence:
   # perl -MCPAN -e'look XML::Parser'         (1)
   # perl Makefile.PL EXPATLIBPATH=/sw/lib EXPATINCPATH=/sw/include
   # make; make test; make install            (2)
   # exit                                     (3)

   (1) (3)
          The look command will download the module and spawn a new shell
          with the extracted files as the current working directory. The
          exit command will return you to your original shell.
   (2)
          You should watch the output from these make commands,
          especially "make test" as errors may prevent XML::Parser from
          functioning correctly with Bugzilla.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.3.3. Linux-Mandrake 8.0

   Linux-Mandrake 8.0 includes every required and optional library for
   Bugzilla. The easiest way to install them is by using the urpmi
   utility. If you follow these commands, you should have everything you
   need for Bugzilla, and ./checksetup.pl should not complain about any
   missing libraries. You may already have some of these installed.
   bash# urpmi perl-mysql
   bash# urpmi perl-chart
   bash# urpmi perl-gd
   bash# urpmi perl-MailTools              (1)
   bash# urpmi apache-modules

   (1)
          for Bugzilla e-mail integration
     _________________________________________________________________

4.4. HTTP Server Configuration

   The Bugzilla Team recommends Apache when using Bugzilla, however, any
   web server that can be configured to run CGI scripts should be able to
   handle Bugzilla. No matter what web server you choose, but especially
   if you choose something other than Apache, you should be sure to read
   Section 5.6.4.

   The plan for this section is to eventually document the specifics of
   how to lock down permissions on individual web servers.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.4.1. Apache httpd

   As mentioned above, the Bugzilla Team recommends Apache for use with
   Bugzilla. You will have to make sure that Apache is properly
   configured to run the Bugzilla CGI scripts. You also need to make sure
   that the .htaccess files created by ./checksetup.pl (shown in Example
   4-2 for the curious) are allowed to override Apache's normal access
   permissions or else important password information may be exposed to
   the Internet.

   Many Apache installations are not configured to run scripts anywhere
   but in the cgi-bin directory; however, we recommend that Bugzilla not
   be installed in the cgi-bin, otherwise the static files such as images
   and JavaScript will not work correctly. To allow scripts to run in the
   normal web space, the following changes should be made to your
   httpd.conf file.

   To allow files with a .cgi extension to be run, make sure the
   following line exists and is uncommented:
   AddHandler cgi-script .cgi

   To allow .htaccess files to override permissions and .cgi files to run
   in the Bugzilla directory, make sure the following two lines are in a
   Directory directive that applies to the Bugzilla directory on your
   system (either the Bugzilla directory or one of its parents).
   Options +ExecCGI
   AllowOverride Limit

   Note

        For more information on Apache and its directives, see the glossary
        entry on Apache.

   Example 4-2. .htaccess files for Apache

   $BUGZILLA_HOME/.htaccess
  # don't allow people to retrieve non-cgi executable files or our private data
  <FilesMatch ^(.*\.pl|.*localconfig.*|runtests.sh)$>
    deny from all
  </FilesMatch>
  <FilesMatch ^(localconfig.js|localconfig.rdf)$>
    allow from all
  </FilesMatch>

   $BUGZILLA_HOME/data/.htaccess
   # nothing in this directory is retrievable unless overriden by an .htaccess
   # in a subdirectory; the only exception is duplicates.rdf, which is used by
   # duplicates.xul and must be loadable over the web
   deny from all
   <Files duplicates.rdf>
     allow from all
   </Files>

   $BUGZILLA_HOME/data/webdot
# Restrict access to .dot files to the public webdot server at research.att.com

# if research.att.com ever changed their IP, or if you use a different
# webdot server, you'll need to edit this
<FilesMatch ^[0-9]+\.dot$>
  Allow from 192.20.225.10
  Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

# Allow access by a local copy of 'dot' to .png, .gif, .jpg, and
# .map files
<FilesMatch ^[0-9]+\.(png|gif|jpg|map)$>
  Allow from all
</FilesMatch>

# And no directory listings, either.
Deny from all

   $BUGZILLA_HOME/Bugzilla/.htaccess
   # nothing in this directory is retrievable unless overriden by an .htaccess
   # in a subdirectory
   deny from all

   $BUGZILLA_HOME/template/.htaccess
   # nothing in this directory is retrievable unless overriden by an .htaccess
   # in a subdirectory
   deny from all
     _________________________________________________________________

4.4.2. Microsoft Internet Information Services

   If you need, or for some reason even want, to use Microsoft's Internet
   Information Services or Personal Web Server you should be able to. You
   will need to configure them to know how to run CGI scripts, however.
   This is described in Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q245225 for
   Internet Information Services and Q231998 for Personal Web Server.

   Also, and this can't be stressed enough, make sure that files such as
   localconfig and your data directory are secured as described in
   Section 5.6.4.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.4.3. AOL Server

   Ben FrantzDale reported success using AOL Server with Bugzilla. He
   reported his experience and what appears below is based on that.

   AOL Server will have to be configured to run CGI scripts, please
   consult the documentation that came with your server for more
   information on how to do this.

   Because AOL Server doesn't support .htaccess files, you'll have to
   create a TCL script. You should create an
   aolserver/modules/tcl/filter.tcl file (the filename shouldn't matter)
   with the following contents (change /bugzilla/ to the web-based path
   to your Bugzilla installation):
   ns_register_filter preauth GET /bugzilla/localconfig filter_deny
   ns_register_filter preauth GET /bugzilla/localconfig~ filter_deny
   ns_register_filter preauth GET /bugzilla/\#localconfig\# filter_deny
   ns_register_filter preauth GET /bugzilla/*.pl filter_deny
   ns_register_filter preauth GET /bugzilla/syncshadowdb filter_deny
   ns_register_filter preauth GET /bugzilla/runtests.sh filter_deny
   ns_register_filter preauth GET /bugzilla/data/* filter_deny
   ns_register_filter preauth GET /bugzilla/template/* filter_deny


   proc filter_deny { why } {
       ns_log Notice "filter_deny"
       return "filter_return"
   }

  Warning

          This probably doesn't account for all possible editor backup files so
          you may wish to add some additional variations of localconfig. For
          more information, see bug 186383 or Bugtraq ID 6501.

   Note

        If you are using webdot from research.att.com (the default
        configuration for the webdotbase paramater), you will need to allow
        access to data/webdot/*.dot for the reasearch.att.com machine.

        If you are using a local installation of GraphViz, you will need to
        allow everybody to access *.png, *.gif, *.jpg, and *.map in the
        data/webdot directory.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.5. Troubleshooting

   This section gives solutions to common Bugzilla installation problems.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.5.1. Bundle::Bugzilla makes me upgrade to Perl 5.6.1

   Try executing perl -MCPAN -e 'install CPAN' and then continuing.

   Certain older versions of the CPAN toolset were somewhat naive about
   how to upgrade Perl modules. When a couple of modules got rolled into
   the core Perl distribution for 5.6.1, CPAN thought that the best way
   to get those modules up to date was to haul down the Perl distribution
   itself and build it. Needless to say, this has caused headaches for
   just about everybody. Upgrading to a newer version of CPAN with the
   commandline above should fix things.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.5.2. DBD::Sponge::db prepare failed

   The following error message may appear due to a bug in DBD::mysql
   (over which the Bugzilla team have no control):
 DBD::Sponge::db prepare failed: Cannot determine NUM_OF_FIELDS at D:/Perl/site
/lib/DBD/mysql.pm line 248.
  SV = NULL(0x0) at 0x20fc444
  REFCNT = 1
  FLAGS = (PADBUSY,PADMY)

   To fix this, go to <path-to-perl>/lib/DBD/sponge.pm in your Perl
   installation and replace
    my $numFields;
    if ($attribs->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'}) {
        $numFields = $attribs->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'};
    } elsif ($attribs->{'NAME'}) {
        $numFields = @{$attribs->{NAME}};

   by
    my $numFields;
    if ($attribs->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'}) {
        $numFields = $attribs->{'NUM_OF_FIELDS'};
    } elsif ($attribs->{'NAMES'}) {
        $numFields = @{$attribs->{NAMES}};

   (note the S added to NAME.)
     _________________________________________________________________

4.5.3. cannot chdir(/var/spool/mqueue)

   If you are installing Bugzilla on SuSE Linux, or some other
   distributions with "paranoid" security options, it is possible that
   the checksetup.pl script may fail with the error:
   cannot chdir(/var/spool/mqueue): Permission denied

   This is because your /var/spool/mqueue directory has a mode of
   "drwx------". Type chmod 755 /var/spool/mqueue as root to fix this
   problem.
     _________________________________________________________________

4.5.4. Your vendor has not defined Fcntl macro O_NOINHERIT

   This is caused by a bug in the version of File::Temp that is
   distributed with perl 5.6.0. Many minor variations of this error have
   been reported. Examples can be found in Figure 4-2.

   Figure 4-2. Other File::Temp error messages
   Your vendor has not defined Fcntl macro O_NOINHERIT, used
   at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/File/Temp.pm line 208.

   Your vendor has not defined Fcntl macro O_EXLOCK, used
   at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/File/Temp.pm line 210.

   Your vendor has not defined Fcntl macro O_TEMPORARY, used
   at /usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.6.0/File/Temp.pm line 233.

   Numerous people have reported that upgrading to version 5.6.1 or
   higher solved the problem for them. A less involved fix is to apply
   the patch in Figure 4-3. The patch is also available as a patch file.

Chapter 5. Administering Bugzilla

5.1. Bugzilla Configuration

   Bugzilla is configured by changing various parameters, accessed from
   the "Edit parameters" link in the page footer. Here are some of the
   key parameters on that page. You should run down this list and set
   them appropriately after installing Bugzilla.
    1. maintainer: The maintainer parameter is the email address of the
       person responsible for maintaining this Bugzilla installation. The
       address need not be that of a valid Bugzilla account.
    2. urlbase: This parameter defines the fully qualified domain name
       and web server path to your Bugzilla installation.
       For example, if your Bugzilla query page is
       http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/query.cgi, set your "urlbase" to
       http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/.
    3. makeproductgroups: This dictates whether or not to automatically
       create groups when new products are created.
    4. useentrygroupdefault: Bugzilla products can have a group
       associated with them, so that certain users can only see bugs in
       certain products. When this parameter is set to "on", this causes
       the initial group controls on newly created products to place all
       newly-created bugs in the group having the same name as the
       product immediately. After a product is initially created, the
       group controls can be further adjusted without interference by
       this mechanism.
    5. shadowdb: You run into an interesting problem when Bugzilla
       reaches a high level of continuous activity. MySQL supports only
       table-level write locking. What this means is that if someone
       needs to make a change to a bug, they will lock the entire table
       until the operation is complete. Locking for write also blocks
       reads until the write is complete. Note that more recent versions
       of mysql support row level locking using different table types.
       These types are slower than the standard type, and Bugzilla does
       not yet take advantage of features such as transactions which
       would justify this speed decrease. The Bugzilla team are, however,
       happy to hear about any experiences with row level locking and
       Bugzilla
       The "shadowdb" parameter was designed to get around this
       limitation. While only a single user is allowed to write to a
       table at a time, reads can continue unimpeded on a read-only
       shadow copy of the database. Although your database size will
       double, a shadow database can cause an enormous performance
       improvement when implemented on extremely high-traffic Bugzilla
       databases.
       As a guide, mozilla.org began needing "shadowdb" when they reached
       around 40,000 Bugzilla users with several hundred Bugzilla bug
       changes and comments per day.
       The value of the parameter defines the name of the shadow bug
       database. You will need to set the host and port settings from the
       params page, and set up replication in your database server so
       that updates reach this readonly mirror. Consult your database
       documentation for more detail.
    6. shutdownhtml: If you need to shut down Bugzilla to perform
       administration, enter some descriptive HTML here and anyone who
       tries to use Bugzilla will receive a page to that effect.
       Obviously, editparams.cgi will still be accessible so you can
       remove the HTML and re-enable Bugzilla. :-)
    7. passwordmail: Every time a user creates an account, the text of
       this parameter (with substitutions) is sent to the new user along
       with their password message.
       Add any text you wish to the "passwordmail" parameter box. For
       instance, many people choose to use this box to give a quick
       training blurb about how to use Bugzilla at your site.
    8. movebugs: This option is an undocumented feature to allow moving
       bugs between separate Bugzilla installations. You will need to
       understand the source code in order to use this feature. Please
       consult movebugs.pl in your Bugzilla source tree for further
       documentation, such as it is.
    9. useqacontact: This allows you to define an email address for each
       component, in addition to that of the default owner, who will be
       sent carbon copies of incoming bugs.
   10. usestatuswhiteboard: This defines whether you wish to have a
       free-form, overwritable field associated with each bug. The
       advantage of the Status Whiteboard is that it can be deleted or
       modified with ease, and provides an easily-searchable field for
       indexing some bugs that have some trait in common.
   11. whinedays: Set this to the number of days you want to let bugs go
       in the NEW or REOPENED state before notifying people they have
       untouched new bugs. If you do not plan to use this feature, simply
       do not set up the whining cron job described in the installation
       instructions, or set this value to "0" (never whine).
   12. commenton*: All these fields allow you to dictate what changes can
       pass without comment, and which must have a comment from the
       person who changed them. Often, administrators will allow users to
       add themselves to the CC list, accept bugs, or change the Status
       Whiteboard without adding a comment as to their reasons for the
       change, yet require that most other changes come with an
       explanation.
       Set the "commenton" options according to your site policy. It is a
       wise idea to require comments when users resolve, reassign, or
       reopen bugs at the very least.

     Note

          It is generally far better to require a developer comment when
          resolving bugs than not. Few things are more annoying to bug database
          users than having a developer mark a bug "fixed" without any comment
          as to what the fix was (or even that it was truly fixed!)
   13. supportwatchers: Turning on this option allows users to ask to
       receive copies of all a particular other user's bug email. This
       is, of course, subject to the groupset restrictions on the bug; if
       the "watcher" would not normally be allowed to view a bug, the
       watcher cannot get around the system by setting herself up to
       watch the bugs of someone with bugs outside her privileges. They
       would still only receive email updates for those bugs she could
       normally view.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.2. User Administration

5.2.1. Creating the Default User

   When you first run checksetup.pl after installing Bugzilla, it will
   prompt you for the administrative username (email address) and
   password for this "super user". If for some reason you delete the
   "super user" account, re-running checksetup.pl will again prompt you
   for this username and password.

   Tip

       If you wish to add more administrative users, add them to the "admin"
       group and, optionally, add edit the tweakparams, editusers,
       creategroups, editcomponents, and editkeywords groups to add the
       entire admin group to those groups.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.2.2. Managing Other Users

5.2.2.1. Creating new users

   Your users can create their own user accounts by clicking the "New
   Account" link at the bottom of each page (assuming they aren't logged
   in as someone else already.) However, should you desire to create user
   accounts ahead of time, here is how you do it.

    1. After logging in, click the "Users" link at the footer of the
       query page, and then click "Add a new user".
    2. Fill out the form presented. This page is self-explanatory. When
       done, click "Submit".

    Note

         Adding a user this way will not send an email informing them of their
         username and password. While useful for creating dummy accounts
         (watchers which shuttle mail to another system, for instance, or email
         addresses which are a mailing list), in general it is preferable to
         log out and use the "New Account" button to create users, as it will
         pre-populate all the required fields and also notify the user of her
         account name and password.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.2.2.2. Modifying Users

   To see a specific user, search for their login name in the box
   provided on the "Edit Users" page. To see all users, leave the box
   blank.

   You can search in different ways the listbox to the right of the text
   entry box. You can match by case-insensitive substring (the default),
   regular expression, or a reverse regular expression match, which finds
   every user name which does NOT match the regular expression. (Please
   see the man regexp manual page for details on regular expression
   syntax.)

   Once you have found your user, you can change the following fields:

     * Login Name: This is generally the user's full email address.
       However, if you have are using the emailsuffix Param, this may
       just be the user's login name. Note that users can now change
       their login names themselves (to any valid email address.)
     * Real Name: The user's real name. Note that Bugzilla does not
       require this to create an account.
     * Password: You can change the user's password here. Users can
       automatically request a new password, so you shouldn't need to do
       this often. If you want to disable an account, see Disable Text
       below.
     * Disable Text: If you type anything in this box, including just a
       space, the user is prevented from logging in, or making any
       changes to bugs via the web interface. The HTML you type in this
       box is presented to the user when they attempt to perform these
       actions, and should explain why the account was disabled.

       Warning

               Don't disable the administrator account!

      Note

           The user can still submit bugs via the e-mail gateway, if you set it
           up, even if the disabled text field is filled in. The e-mail gateway
           should not be enabled for secure installations of Bugzilla.
     * <groupname>: If you have created some groups, e.g.
       "securitysensitive", then checkboxes will appear here to allow you
       to add users to, or remove them from, these groups.
     * canconfirm: This field is only used if you have enabled the
       "unconfirmed" status. If you enable this for a user, that user can
       then move bugs from "Unconfirmed" to a "Confirmed" status (e.g.:
       "New" status).
     * creategroups: This option will allow a user to create and destroy
       groups in Bugzilla.
     * editbugs: Unless a user has this bit set, they can only edit those
       bugs for which they are the assignee or the reporter. Even if this
       option is unchecked, users can still add comments to bugs.
     * editcomponents: This flag allows a user to create new products and
       components, as well as modify and destroy those that have no bugs
       associated with them. If a product or component has bugs
       associated with it, those bugs must be moved to a different
       product or component before Bugzilla will allow them to be
       destroyed.
     * editkeywords: If you use Bugzilla's keyword functionality,
       enabling this feature allows a user to create and destroy
       keywords. As always, the keywords for existing bugs containing the
       keyword the user wishes to destroy must be changed before Bugzilla
       will allow it to die.
     * editusers: This flag allows a user to do what you're doing right
       now: edit other users. This will allow those with the right to do
       so to remove administrator privileges from other users or grant
       them to themselves. Enable with care.
     * tweakparams: This flag allows a user to change Bugzilla's Params
       (using editparams.cgi.)
     * <productname>: This allows an administrator to specify the
       products in which a user can see bugs. The user must still have
       the "editbugs" privilege to edit bugs in these products.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.3. Product, Component, Milestone, and Version Administration

5.3.1. Products

   Products are the broadest category in Bugzilla, and tend to represent
   real-world shipping products. E.g. if your company makes computer
   games, you should have one product per game, perhaps a "Common"
   product for units of technology used in multiple games, and maybe a
   few special products (Website, Administration...)

   Many of Bugzilla's settings are configurable on a per-product basis.
   The number of "votes" available to users is set per-product, as is the
   number of votes required to move a bug automatically from the
   UNCONFIRMED status to the NEW status.

   To create a new product:

    1. Select "products" from the footer
    2. Select the "Add" link in the bottom right
    3. Enter the name of the product and a description. The Description
       field may contain HTML.

   Don't worry about the "Closed for bug entry", "Maximum Votes per
   person", "Maximum votes a person can put on a single bug", "Number of
   votes a bug in this Product needs to automatically get out of the
   UNCOMFIRMED state", and "Version" options yet. We'll cover those in a
   few moments.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.3.2. Components

   Components are subsections of a Product. E.g. the computer game you
   are designing may have a "UI" component, an "API" component, a "Sound
   System" component, and a "Plugins" component, each overseen by a
   different programmer. It often makes sense to divide Components in
   Bugzilla according to the natural divisions of responsibility within
   your Product or company.

   Each component has a owner and (if you turned it on in the
   parameters), a QA Contact. The owner should be the primary person who
   fixes bugs in that component. The QA Contact should be the person who
   will ensure these bugs are completely fixed. The Owner, QA Contact,
   and Reporter will get email when new bugs are created in this
   Component and when these bugs change. Default Owner and Default QA
   Contact fields only dictate the default assignments; these can be
   changed on bug submission, or at any later point in a bug's life.

   To create a new Component:

    1. Select the "Edit components" link from the "Edit product" page
    2. Select the "Add" link in the bottom right.
    3. Fill out the "Component" field, a short "Description", the
       "Initial Owner" and "Initial QA Contact" (if enabled.) The
       Component and Description fields may contain HTML; the "Initial
       Owner" field must be a login name already existing in the
       database.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.3.3. Versions

   Versions are the revisions of the product, such as "Flinders 3.1",
   "Flinders 95", and "Flinders 2000". Version is not a multi-select
   field; the usual practice is to select the most recent version with
   the bug.

   To create and edit Versions:

    1. From the "Edit product" screen, select "Edit Versions"
    2. You will notice that the product already has the default version
       "undefined". Click the "Add" link in the bottom right.
    3. Enter the name of the Version. This field takes text only. Then
       click the "Add" button.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.3.4. Milestones

   Milestones are "targets" that you plan to get a bug fixed by. For
   example, you have a bug that you plan to fix for your 3.0 release, it
   would be assigned the milestone of 3.0.

   Note

        Milestone options will only appear for a Product if you turned on the
        "usetargetmilestone" Param in the "Edit Parameters" screen.

   To create new Milestones, set Default Milestones, and set Milestone
   URL:

    1. Select "Edit milestones" from the "Edit product" page.
    2. Select "Add" in the bottom right corner. text
    3. Enter the name of the Milestone in the "Milestone" field. You can
       optionally set the "sortkey", which is a positive or negative
       number (-255 to 255) that defines where in the list this
       particular milestone appears. This is because milestones often do
       not occur in alphanumeric order For example, "Future" might be
       after "Release 1.2". Select "Add".
    4. From the Edit product screen, you can enter the URL of a page
       which gives information about your milestones and what they mean.

     Tip

         If you want your milestone document to be restricted so that it can
         only be viewed by people in a particular Bugzilla group, the best way
         is to attach the document to a bug in that group, and make the URL the
         URL of that attachment.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.4. Voting

   Voting allows users to be given a pot of votes which they can allocate
   to bugs, to indicate that they'd like them fixed. This allows
   developers to gauge user need for a particular enhancement or bugfix.
   By allowing bugs with a certain number of votes to automatically move
   from "UNCONFIRMED" to "NEW", users of the bug system can help
   high-priority bugs garner attention so they don't sit for a long time
   awaiting triage.

   To modify Voting settings:

    1. Navigate to the "Edit product" screen for the Product you wish to
       modify
    2. Maximum Votes per person: Setting this field to "0" disables
       voting.
    3. Maximum Votes a person can put on a single bug: It should probably
       be some number lower than the "Maximum votes per person". Don't
       set this field to "0" if "Maximum votes per person" is non-zero;
       that doesn't make any sense.
    4. Number of votes a bug in this product needs to automatically get
       out of the UNCONFIRMED state: Setting this field to "0" disables
       the automatic move of bugs from UNCONFIRMED to NEW.
    5. Once you have adjusted the values to your preference, click
       "Update".
     _________________________________________________________________

5.5. Groups and Group Security

   Groups allow the administrator to isolate bugs or products that should
   only be seen by certain people. The association between products and
   groups is controlled from the product edit page under "Edit Group
   Controls."

   If the makeproductgroups param is on, a new group will be
   automatically created for every new product.

   On the product edit page, there is a page to edit the "Group Controls"
   for a product and determine which groups are applicable, default, and
   mandatory for each product as well as controlling entry for each
   product and being able to set bugs in a product to be totally
   read-only unless some group restrictions are met.

   For each group, it is possible to specify if membership in that group
   is...

    1. required for bug entry,
    2. Not applicable to this product(NA), a possible restriction for a
       member of the group to place on a bug in this product(Shown), a
       default restriction for a member of the group to place on a bug in
       this product(Default), or a mandatory restriction to be placed on
       bugs in this product(Mandatory).
    3. Not applicable by non-members to this product(NA), a possible
       restriction for a non-member of the group to place on a bug in
       this product(Shown), a default restriction for a non-member of the
       group to place on a bug in this product(Default), or a mandatory
       restriction to be placed on bugs in this product when entered by a
       non-member(Mandatory).
    4. required in order to make any change to bugs in this product
       including comments.

   To create Groups:

    1. Select the "groups" link in the footer.
    2. Take a moment to understand the instructions on the "Edit Groups"
       screen, then select the "Add Group" link.
    3. Fill out the "Group", "Description", and "User RegExp" fields.
       "User RegExp" allows you to automatically place all users who
       fulfill the Regular Expression into the new group. When you have
       finished, click "Add".

  Warning

          The User Regexp is a perl regexp and, if not anchored, will match any
          part of an address. So, if you do not want to grant access into
          'mycompany.com' to 'badperson@mycompany.com.hacker.net', use
          '@mycompany\.com$' as the regexp.
    4. After you add your new group, edit the new group. On the edit
       page, you can specify other groups that should be included in this
       group and which groups should be permitted to add and delete users
       from this group.

   Note that group permissions are such that you need to be a member of
   all the groups a bug is in, for whatever reason, to see that bug.
   Similarly, you must be a member of all of the entry groups for a
   product to add bugs to a product and you must be a member of all of
   the canedit groups for a product in order to make any change to bugs
   in that product.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.6. Bugzilla Security

   Warning

           Poorly-configured MySQL and Bugzilla installations have given
           attackers full access to systems in the past. Please take these
           guidelines seriously, even for Bugzilla machines hidden away behind
           your firewall. 80% of all computer trespassers are insiders, not
           anonymous crackers.

   Note

        These instructions must, of necessity, be somewhat vague since
        Bugzilla runs on so many different platforms. If you have refinements
        of these directions, please submit a bug to Bugzilla Documentation.

 Warning

         This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of every possible
         security issue regarding the tools mentioned in this section. There is
         no subsitute for reading the information written by the authors of any
         software running on your system.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.6.1. TCP/IP Ports

   TCP/IP defines 65,000 some ports for trafic. Of those, Bugzilla only
   needs 1... 2 if you need to use features that require e-mail such as
   bug moving or the e-mail interface from contrib. You should audit your
   server and make sure that you aren't listening on any ports you don't
   need to be. You may also wish to use some kind of firewall software to
   be sure that trafic can only be recieved on ports you specify.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.6.2. MySQL

   MySQL ships by default with many settings that should be changed. By
   defaults it allows anybody to connect from localhost without a
   password and have full administrative capabilities. It also defaults
   to not have a root password (this is not the same as the system root).
   Also, many installations default to running mysqld as the system root.

    1. Consult the documentation that came with your system for
       information on making mysqld run as an unprivleged user.
    2. You should also be sure to disable the anonymous user account and
       set a password for the root user. This is accomplished using the
       following commands:

bash$ mysql mysql
mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE user = '';
mysql> UPDATE user SET password = password('new_password') WHERE user = 'root';
mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


       From this point forward you will need to use mysql -u root -p and
       enter new_password when prompted when using the mysql client.
    3. If you run MySQL on the same machine as your httpd server, you
       should consider disabling networking from within MySQL by adding
       the following to your /etc/my.conf:

       [myslqd]
       # Prevent network access to MySQL.
       skip-networking


    4. You may also consider running MySQL, or even all of Bugzilla in a
       chroot jail; however, instructions for doing that are beyond the
       scope of this document.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.6.3. Daemon Accounts

   Many daemons, such as Apache's httpd and MySQL's mysqld default to
   running as either "root" or "nobody". Running as "root" introduces
   obvious security problems, but the problems introduced by running
   everything as "nobody" may not be so obvious. Basically, if you're
   running every daemon as "nobody" and one of them gets comprimised,
   they all get comprimised. For this reason it is recommended that you
   create a user account for each daemon.

   Note

        You will need to set the webservergroup to the group you created for
        your webserver to run as in localconfig. This will allow
        ./checksetup.pl to better adjust the file permissions on your Bugzilla
        install so as to not require making anything world-writable.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.6.4. Web Server Access Controls

   There are many files that are placed in the Bugzilla directory area
   that should not be accessable from the web. Because of the way
   Bugzilla is currently layed out, the list of what should and should
   not be accessible is rather complicated. A new installation method is
   currently in the works which should solve this by allowing files that
   shouldn't be accessible from the web to be placed in directory outside
   the webroot. See bug 44659 for more information.

     * In the main Bugzilla directory, you should:
          + Block: *.pl, *localconfig*, runtests.sh
          + But allow: localconfig.js, localconfig.rdf
     * In data:
          + Block everything
          + But allow: duplicates.rdf
     * In data/webdot:
          + If you use a remote webdot server:
               o Block everything
               o But allow *.dot only for the remote webdot server
          + Otherwise, if you use a local GraphViz:
               o Block everything
               o But allow: *.png, *.gif, *.jpg, *.map
          + And if you don't use any dot:
               o Block everything
     * In Bugzilla:
          + Block everything
     * In template:
          + Block everything

   Tip

       Bugzilla ships with the ability to generate .htaccess files
       instructing Apache which files should and should not be accessible.
       For more information, see Section 4.4.1.

   You should test to make sure that the files mentioned above are not
   accessible from the Internet, especially your localconfig file which
   contains your database password. To test, simply point your web
   browser at the file; for example, to test mozilla.org's installation,
   we'd try to access http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/localconfig. You should
   get a 403 Forbidden error.

 Caution

         Not following the instructions in this section, including testing, may
         result in sensitive information being globally accessible.

   Tip

       You should check Section 4.4 to see if instructions have been included
       for your web server. You should also compare those instructions with
       this list to make sure everything is properly accounted for.

5.7. Template Customization

   One of the large changes for 2.16 was the templatization of the entire
   user-facing UI, using the Template Toolkit. Administrators can now
   configure the look and feel of Bugzilla without having to edit Perl
   files or face the nightmare of massive merge conflicts when they
   upgrade to a newer version in the future.

   Templatization also makes localized versions of Bugzilla possible, for
   the first time. As of version 2.17.4 which will soon become 2.18, it's
   possible to have Bugzilla's language determined by the user's browser.
   More information is available in Section 5.7.5.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.1. What to Edit

   There are two different ways of editing of Bugzilla's templates, and
   which you use depends mainly on how you upgrade Bugzilla. The template
   directory structure is that there's a top level directory, template,
   which contains a directory for each installed localization. The
   default English templates are therefore in en. Underneath that, there
   is the default directory and optionally the custom directory. The
   default directory contains all the templates shipped with Bugzilla,
   whereas the custom directory does not exist at first and must be
   created if you want to use it.

   The first method of making customizations is to directly edit the
   templates in template/en/default. This is probably the best method for
   small changes if you are going to use the CVS method of upgrading,
   because if you then execute a cvs update, any template fixes will get
   automagically merged into your modified versions.

   If you use this method, your installation will break if CVS conflicts
   occur.

   The other method is to copy the templates into a mirrored directory
   structure under template/en/custom. The templates in this directory
   automatically override those in default. This is the technique you
   need to use if you use the overwriting method of upgrade, because
   otherwise your changes will be lost. This method is also better if you
   are using the CVS method of upgrading and are going to make major
   changes, because it is guaranteed that the contents of this directory
   will not be touched during an upgrade, and you can then decide whether
   to continue using your own templates, or make the effort to merge your
   changes into the new versions by hand.

   If you use this method, your installation may break if incompatible
   changes are made to the template interface. If such changes are made
   they will be documented in the release notes, provided you are using a
   stable release of Bugzilla. If you use using unstable code, you will
   need to deal with this one yourself, although if possible the changes
   will be mentioned before they occur in the deprecations section of the
   previous stable release's release notes.

   Note

        Don't directly edit the compiled templates in data/template/* - your
        changes will be lost when Template Toolkit recompiles them.

   Note

        It is recommended that you run ./checksetup.pl after any template
        edits, especially if you've created a new file in the custom
        directory.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.2. How To Edit Templates

   The syntax of the Template Toolkit language is beyond the scope of
   this guide. It's reasonably easy to pick up by looking at the current
   templates; or, you can read the manual, available on the Template
   Toolkit home page. However, you should particularly remember (for
   security reasons) to always HTML filter things which come from the
   database or user input, to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.

   However, one thing you should take particular care about is the need
   to properly HTML filter data that has been passed into the template.
   This means that if the data can possibly contain special HTML
   characters such as <, and the data was not intended to be HTML, they
   need to be converted to entity form, ie &lt;. You use the 'html'
   filter in the Template Toolkit to do this. If you fail to do this, you
   may open up your installation to cross-site scripting attacks.

   Also note that Bugzilla adds a few filters of its own, that are not in
   standard Template Toolkit. In particular, the 'url_quote' filter can
   convert characters that are illegal or have special meaning in URLs,
   such as &, to the encoded form, ie %26. This actually encodes most
   characters (but not the common ones such as letters and numbers and so
   on), including the HTML-special characters, so there's never a need to
   HTML filter afterwards.

   Editing templates is a good way of doing a "poor man's custom fields".
   For example, if you don't use the Status Whiteboard, but want to have
   a free-form text entry box for "Build Identifier", then you can just
   edit the templates to change the field labels. It's still be called
   status_whiteboard internally, but your users don't need to know that.

   Note

        If you are making template changes that you intend on submitting back
        for inclusion in standard Bugzilla, you should read the relevant
        sections of the Developers' Guide.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.3. Template Formats

   Some CGIs have the ability to use more than one template. For example,
   buglist.cgi can output bug lists as RDF or two different forms of HTML
   (complex and simple). (Try this out by appending &format=simple to a
   buglist.cgi URL on your Bugzilla installation.) This mechanism, called
   template 'formats', is extensible.

   To see if a CGI supports multiple output formats, grep the CGI for
   "ValidateOutputFormat". If it's not present, adding multiple format
   support isn't too hard - see how it's done in other CGIs.

   To make a new format template for a CGI which supports this, open a
   current template for that CGI and take note of the INTERFACE comment
   (if present.) This comment defines what variables are passed into this
   template. If there isn't one, I'm afraid you'll have to read the
   template and the code to find out what information you get.

   Write your template in whatever markup or text style is appropriate.

   You now need to decide what content type you want your template served
   as. Open up the localconfig file and find the $contenttypes variable.
   If your content type is not there, add it. Remember the three- or
   four-letter tag assigned to you content type. This tag will be part of
   the template filename.

   Save the template as <stubname>-<formatname>.<contenttypetag>.tmpl.
   Try out the template by calling the CGI as
   <cginame>.cgi?format=<formatname> .
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.4. Particular Templates

   There are a few templates you may be particularly interested in
   customizing for your installation.

   index.html.tmpl: This is the Bugzilla front page.

   global/header.html.tmpl: This defines the header that goes on all
   Bugzilla pages. The header includes the banner, which is what appears
   to users and is probably what you want to edit instead. However the
   header also includes the HTML HEAD section, so you could for example
   add a stylesheet or META tag by editing the header.

   global/banner.html.tmpl: This contains the "banner", the part of the
   header that appears at the top of all Bugzilla pages. The default
   banner is reasonably barren, so you'll probably want to customize this
   to give your installation a distinctive look and feel. It is
   recommended you preserve the Bugzilla version number in some form so
   the version you are running can be determined, and users know what
   docs to read.

   global/footer.html.tmpl: This defines the footer that goes on all
   Bugzilla pages. Editing this is another way to quickly get a
   distinctive look and feel for your Bugzilla installation.

   bug/create/user-message.html.tmpl: This is a message that appears near
   the top of the bug reporting page. By modifying this, you can tell
   your users how they should report bugs.

   bug/process/midair.html.tmpl: This is the page used if two people
   submit simultaneous changes to the same bug. The second person to
   submit their changes will get this page to tell them what the first
   person did, and ask if they wish to overwrite those changes or go back
   and revisit the bug. The default title and header on this page read
   "Mid-air collision detected!" If you work in the aviation industry, or
   other environment where this might be found offensive (yes, we have
   true stories of this happening) you'll want to change this to
   something more appropriate for your environment.

   bug/create/create.html.tmpl and bug/create/comment.txt.tmpl: You may
   wish to get bug submitters to give certain bits of structured
   information, each in a separate input widget, for which there is not a
   field in the database. The bug entry system has been designed in an
   extensible fashion to enable you to define arbitrary fields and
   widgets, and have their values appear formatted in the initial
   Description, rather than in database fields. An example of this is the
   mozilla.org guided bug submission form.

   To make this work, create a custom template for enter_bug.cgi (the
   default template, on which you could base it, is create.html.tmpl),
   and either call it create.html.tmpl or use a format and call it
   create-<formatname>.html.tmpl. Put it in the custom/bug/create
   directory. In it, add widgets for each piece of information you'd like
   collected - such as a build number, or set of steps to reproduce.

   Then, create a template like custom/bug/create/comment.txt.tmpl, also
   named after your format if you are using one, which references the
   form fields you have created. When a bug report is submitted, the
   initial comment attached to the bug report will be formatted according
   to the layout of this template.

   For example, if your enter_bug template had a field
   <input type="text" name="buildid" size="30">

   and then your comment.txt.tmpl had
   BuildID: [% form.buildid %]

   then
   BuildID: 20020303

   would appear in the initial checkin comment.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.7.5. Configuring Bugzilla to Detect the User's Language

   Begining in version 2.18 (first introduced in version 2.17.4), it's
   now possible to have the users web browser tell Bugzilla which
   language templates to use for each visitor (using the HTTP_ACCEPT
   header). For this to work, Bugzilla needs to have the correct language
   templates installed for the version of Bugzilla you are using. Many
   language templates can be obtained from
   http://www.bugzilla.org/download.html#localizations. Instructions for
   submitting new languages are also available from that location.

   After untarring the localizations (or creating your own) in the
   [Bugzilla_Root]/template directory, you must update the languages
   parameter to contain any localizations you'd like to permit. You may
   also wish to set the defaultlanguage parameter to something other than
   "en" if you don't want Engish to be the default language.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.8. Change Permission Customization

  Warning

          This feature should be considered experimental; the Bugzilla code you
          will be changing is not stable, and could change or move between
          versions. Be aware that if you make modifications to it, you may have
          to re-make them or port them if Bugzilla changes internally between
          versions.

   Companies often have rules about which employees, or classes of
   employees, are allowed to change certain things in the bug system. For
   example, only the bug's designated QA Contact may be allowed to VERIFY
   the bug. Bugzilla has been designed to make it easy for you to write
   your own custom rules to define who is allowed to make what sorts of
   value transition.

   For maximum flexibility, customizing this means editing Bugzilla's
   Perl code. This gives the administrator complete control over exactly
   who is allowed to do what. The relevant function is called
   CheckCanChangeField(), and is found in process_bug.cgi in your
   Bugzilla directory. If you open that file and grep for "sub
   CheckCanChangeField", you'll find it.

   This function has been carefully commented to allow you to see exactly
   how it works, and give you an idea of how to make changes to it.
   Certain marked sections should not be changed - these are the
   "plumbing" which makes the rest of the function work. In between those
   sections, you'll find snippets of code like:
       # Allow the owner to change anything.
       if ($ownerid eq $whoid) {
           return 1;
       }

   It's fairly obvious what this piece of code does.

   So, how does one go about changing this function? Well, simple changes
   can be made just be removing pieces - for example, if you wanted to
   prevent any user adding a comment to a bug, just remove the lines
   marked "Allow anyone to change comments." And if you want the reporter
   to have no special rights on bugs they have filed, just remove the
   entire section which refers to him.

   More complex customizations are not much harder. Basically, you add a
   check in the right place in the function, i.e. after all the variables
   you are using have been set up. So, don't look at $ownerid before
   $ownerid has been obtained from the database. You can either add a
   positive check, which returns 1 (allow) if certain conditions are
   true, or a negative check, which returns 0 (deny.) E.g.:
       if ($field eq "qacontact") {
           if (Bugzilla->user->groups("quality_assurance")) {
               return 1;
           }
           else {
               return 0;
           }
       }

   This says that only users in the group "quality_assurance" can change
   the QA Contact field of a bug. Getting more weird:
       if (($field eq "priority") &&
           (Bugzilla->user->email =~ /.*\@example\.com$/))
       {
           if ($oldvalue eq "P1") {
               return 1;
           }
           else {
               return 0;
           }
       }

   This says that if the user is trying to change the priority field, and
   their email address is @example.com, they can only do so if the old
   value of the field was "P1". Not very useful, but illustrative.

   For a list of possible field names, look in data/versioncache for the
   list called @::log_columns. If you need help writing custom rules for
   your organization, ask in the newsgroup.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.9. Upgrading to New Releases

 Warning

         Upgrading is a one-way process. You should backup your database and
         current Bugzilla directory before attempting the upgrade. If you wish
         to revert to the old Bugzilla version for any reason, you will have to
         restore from these backups.

   Upgrading Bugzilla is something we all want to do from time to time,
   be it to get new features or pick up the latest security fix. How easy
   it is to update depends on a few factors.

     * If the new version is a revision or a new point release
     * How many, if any, local changes have been made

   There are also three different methods to upgrade your installation.

    1. Using CVS (Example 5-1)
    2. Downloading a new tarball (Example 5-2)
    3. Applying the relevant patches (Example 5-3)

   Which options are available to you may depend on how large a jump you
   are making and/or your network configuration.

   Revisions are normally released to fix security vulnerabilities and
   are distinguished by an increase in the third number. For example,
   when 2.16.2 was released, it was a revision to 2.16.1.

   Point releases are normally released when the Bugzilla team feels that
   there has been a significant amount of progress made between the last
   point release and the current time. These are often proceeded by a
   stabilization period and release candidates, however the use of
   development versions or release candidates is beyond the scope of this
   document. Point releases can be distinguished by an increase in the
   second number, or minor version. For example, 2.16.2 is a newer point
   release than 2.14.5.

   The examples in this section are written as if you were updating to
   version 2.16.2. The procedures are the same regardless if you are
   updating to a new point release or a new revision. However, the chance
   of running into trouble increases when upgrading to a new point
   release, escpecially if you've made local changes.

   These examples also assume that your Bugzilla installation is at
   /var/www/html/bugzilla. If that is not the case, simply substitute the
   proper paths where appropriate.

   Example 5-1. Upgrading using CVS

   Every release of Bugzilla, whether it is a revision or a point
   release, is tagged in CVS. Also, every tarball we have distributed
   since version 2.12 has been primed for using CVS. This does, however,
   require that you are able to access cvs-mirror.mozilla.org on port
   2401.

   Tip

       If you can do this, updating using CVS is probably the most painless
       method, especially if you have a lot of local changes.
   bash$ cd /var/www/html/bugzilla
   bash$ cvs login
   Logging in to :pserver:anonymous@cvs-mirror.mozilla.org:2401/cvsroot
   CVS password: anonymous
   bash$ cvs -q update -r BUGZILLA-2_16_2 -dP
   P checksetup.pl
   P collectstats.pl
   P globals.pl
   P docs/rel_notes.txt
   P template/en/default/list/quips.html.tmpl

   Caution

           If a line in the output from cvs update begins with a C that
           represents a file with local changes that CVS was unable to properly
           merge. You need to resolve these conflicts manually before Bugzilla
           (or at least the portion using that file) will be usable.

   Note

        You also need to run ./checksetup.pl before your Bugzilla upgrade will
        be complete.

   Example 5-2. Upgrading using the tarball

   If you are unable or unwilling to use CVS, another option that's
   always available is to download the latest tarball. This is the most
   difficult option to use, especially if you have local changes.
   bash$ cd /var/www/html
   bash$ wget ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/webtools/bugzilla-2.16.2.tar.gz
   Output omitted
   bash$ tar xzvf bugzilla-2.16.2.tar.gz
   bugzilla-2.16.2/
   bugzilla-2.16.2/.cvsignore
   bugzilla-2.16.2/1x1.gif
   Output truncated
   bash$ cd bugzilla-2.16.2
   bash$ cp ../bugzilla/localconfig* .
   bash$ cp -r ../bugzilla/data .
   bash$ cd ..
   bash$ mv bugzilla bugzilla.old
   bash$ mv bugzilla-2.16.2 bugzilla
   bash$ cd bugzilla
   bash$ ./checksetup.pl
   Output omitted

   Warning

           The cp commands both end with periods which is a very important
           detail, it tells the shell that the destination directory is the
           current working directory. Also, the period at the beginning of the
           ./checksetup.pl is important and can not be omitted.

   Note

        You will now have to reapply any changes you have made to your local
        installation manually.

   Example 5-3. Upgrading using patches

   The Bugzilla team will normally make a patch file available for
   revisions to go from the most recent revision to the new one. You
   could also read the release notes and grab the patches attached to the
   mentioned bug, but it is safer to use the released patch file as
   sometimes patches get changed before they get checked in (for minor
   spelling fixes and the like). It is also theorectically possible to
   scour the fixed bug list and pick and choose which patches to apply
   from a point release, but this is not recommended either as what
   you'll end up with is a hodge podge Bugzilla that isn't really any
   version. This would also make it more difficult to upgrade in the
   future.
bash$ cd /var/www/html/bugzilla
bash$ wget ftp://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/webtools/bugzilla-2.16.1-to-2.16.2.diff.gz
Output omitted
bash$ gunzip bugzilla-2.16.1-to-2.16.2.diff.gz
bash$ patch -p1 < bugzilla-2.16.1-to-2.16.2.diff
patching file checksetup.pl
patching file collectstats.pl
patching file globals.pl

   Caution

           If you do this, beware that this doesn't change the entires in your
           CVS directory so it may make updates using CVS (Example 5-1) more
           difficult in the future.

5.10. Integrating Bugzilla with Third-Party Tools

5.10.1. Bonsai

   Bonsai is a web-based tool for managing CVS, the Concurrent Versioning
   System . Using Bonsai, administrators can control open/closed status
   of trees, query a fast relational database back-end for change,
   branch, and comment information, and view changes made since the last
   time the tree was closed. Bonsai also integrates with Tinderbox, the
   Mozilla automated build management system.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.10.2. CVS

   CVS integration is best accomplished, at this point, using the
   Bugzilla Email Gateway.

   Follow the instructions in this Guide for enabling Bugzilla e-mail
   integration. Ensure that your check-in script sends an email to your
   Bugzilla e-mail gateway with the subject of "[Bug XXXX]", and you can
   have CVS check-in comments append to your Bugzilla bug. If you want to
   have the bug be closed automatically, you'll have to modify the
   contrib/bugzilla_email_append.pl script.

   There is also a CVSZilla project, based upon somewhat dated Bugzilla
   code, to integrate CVS and Bugzilla through CVS' ability to email.
   Check it out at: http://homepages.kcbbs.gen.nz/~tonyg/.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.10.3. Perforce SCM

   You can find the project page for Bugzilla and Teamtrack Perforce
   integration (p4dti) at: http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/p4dti/ .
   "p4dti" is now an officially supported product from Perforce, and you
   can find the "Perforce Public Depot" p4dti page at
   http://public.perforce.com/public/perforce/p4dti/index.html .

   Integration of Perforce with Bugzilla, once patches are applied, is
   seamless. Perforce replication information will appear below the
   comments of each bug. Be certain you have a matching set of patches
   for the Bugzilla version you are installing. p4dti is designed to
   support multiple defect trackers, and maintains its own documentation
   for it. Please consult the pages linked above for further information.
     _________________________________________________________________

5.10.4. Tinderbox/Tinderbox2

   We need Tinderbox integration information.

Appendix A. The Bugzilla FAQ

   This FAQ includes questions not covered elsewhere in the Guide.

   1. General Questions

        A.1.1. Where can I find information about Bugzilla?
        A.1.2. What license is Bugzilla distributed under?
        A.1.3. How do I get commercial support for Bugzilla?
        A.1.4. What major companies or projects are currently using
                Bugzilla for bug-tracking?

        A.1.5. Who maintains Bugzilla?
        A.1.6. How does Bugzilla stack up against other bug-tracking
                databases?

        A.1.7. Why doesn't Bugzilla offer this or that feature or
                compatibility with this other tracking software?

        A.1.8. Why MySQL? I'm interested in seeing Bugzilla run on
                Oracle/Sybase/Msql/PostgreSQL/MSSQL.

        A.1.9. What is /usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl?
        A.1.10. My perl is not located at /usr/bin/perl, is there an easy
                way to change it everywhere it needs to be changed?

        A.1.11. Is there an easy way to change the Bugzilla cookie name?

   2. Managerial Questions

        A.2.1. Is Bugzilla web-based, or do you have to have specific
                software or a specific operating system on your machine?

        A.2.2. Can Bugzilla integrate with Perforce (SCM software)?
        A.2.3. Does Bugzilla allow the user to track multiple projects?
        A.2.4. If I am on many projects, and search for all bugs assigned
                to me, will Bugzilla list them for me and allow me to
                sort by project, severity etc?

        A.2.5. Does Bugzilla allow attachments (text, screenshots, URLs
                etc)? If yes, are there any that are NOT allowed?

        A.2.6. Does Bugzilla allow us to define our own priorities and
                levels? Do we have complete freedom to change the labels
                of fields and format of them, and the choice of
                acceptable values?

        A.2.7. Does Bugzilla provide any reporting features, metrics,
                graphs, etc? You know, the type of stuff that management
                likes to see. :)

        A.2.8. Is there email notification and if so, what do you see
                when you get an email?

        A.2.9. Can email notification be set up to send to multiple
                people, some on the To List, CC List, BCC List etc?

        A.2.10. Do users have to have any particular type of email
                application?

        A.2.11. Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If
                I had outsiders write up a bug report using a MS Word bug
                template, could that template be imported into "matching"
                fields? If I wanted to take the results of a query and
                export that data to MS Excel, could I do that?

        A.2.12. Has anyone converted Bugzilla to another language to be
                used in other countries? Is it localizable?

        A.2.13. Can a user create and save reports? Can they do this in
                Word format? Excel format?

        A.2.14. Does Bugzilla have the ability to search by word, phrase,
                compound search?

        A.2.15. Does Bugzilla provide record locking when there is
                simultaneous access to the same bug? Does the second
                person get a notice that the bug is in use or how are
                they notified?

        A.2.16. Are there any backup features provided?
        A.2.17. Can users be on the system while a backup is in progress?

        A.2.18. What type of human resources are needed to be on staff to
                install and maintain Bugzilla? Specifically, what type of
                skills does the person need to have? I need to find out
                if we were to go with Bugzilla, what types of individuals
                would we need to hire and how much would that cost vs
                buying an "Out-of-the-Box" solution.

        A.2.19. What time frame are we looking at if we decide to hire
                people to install and maintain the Bugzilla? Is this
                something that takes hours or weeks to install and a
                couple of hours per week to maintain and customize or is
                this a multi-week install process, plus a full time job
                for 1 person, 2 people, etc?

        A.2.20. Is there any licensing fee or other fees for using
                Bugzilla? Any out-of-pocket cost other than the bodies
                needed as identified above?

   3. Bugzilla Security

        A.3.1. How do I completely disable MySQL security if it's giving
                me problems (I've followed the instructions in the
                installation section of this guide)?

        A.3.2. Are there any security problems with Bugzilla?
        A.3.3. I've implemented the security fixes mentioned in Chris
                Yeh's security advisory of 5/10/2000 advising not to run
                MySQL as root, and am running into problems with MySQL no
                longer working correctly.

   4. Bugzilla Email

        A.4.1. I have a user who doesn't want to receive any more email
                from Bugzilla. How do I stop it entirely for this user?

        A.4.2. I'm evaluating/testing Bugzilla, and don't want it to send
                email to anyone but me. How do I do it?

        A.4.3. I want whineatnews.pl to whine at something more, or other
                than, only new bugs. How do I do it?

        A.4.4. I don't like/want to use Procmail to hand mail off to
                bug_email.pl. What alternatives do I have?

        A.4.5. How do I set up the email interface to submit/change bugs
                via email?

        A.4.6. Email takes FOREVER to reach me from Bugzilla -- it's
                extremely slow. What gives?

        A.4.7. How come email from Bugzilla changes never reaches me?

   5. Bugzilla Database

        A.5.1. I've heard Bugzilla can be used with Oracle?
        A.5.2. I think my database might be corrupted, or contain invalid
                entries. What do I do?

        A.5.3. I want to manually edit some entries in my database. How?
        A.5.4. I think I've set up MySQL permissions correctly, but
                Bugzilla still can't connect.

        A.5.5. How do I synchronize bug information among multiple
                different Bugzilla databases?

   6. Bugzilla and Win32

        A.6.1. What is the easiest way to run Bugzilla on Win32
                (Win98+/NT/2K)?

        A.6.2. Is there a "Bundle::Bugzilla" equivalent for Win32?
        A.6.3. CGI's are failing with a "something.cgi is not a valid
                Windows NT application" error. Why?

        A.6.4. I'm having trouble with the perl modules for NT not being
                able to talk to to the database.

   7. Bugzilla Usage

        A.7.1. How do I change my user name (email address) in Bugzilla?
        A.7.2. The query page is very confusing. Isn't there a simpler
                way to query?

        A.7.3. I'm confused by the behavior of the "accept" button in the
                Show Bug form. Why doesn't it assign the bug to me when I
                accept it?

        A.7.4. I can't upload anything into the database via the "Create
                Attachment" link. What am I doing wrong?

        A.7.5. How do I change a keyword in Bugzilla, once some bugs are
                using it?

   8. Bugzilla Hacking

        A.8.1. What kind of style should I use for templatization?
        A.8.2. What bugs are in Bugzilla right now?
        A.8.3. How can I change the default priority to a null value? For
                instance, have the default priority be "---" instead of
                "P2"?

        A.8.4. What's the best way to submit patches? What guidelines
                should I follow?

1. General Questions

   A.1.1. Where can I find information about Bugzilla?

   You can stay up-to-date with the latest Bugzilla information at
   http://www.bugzilla.org/.

   A.1.2. What license is Bugzilla distributed under?

   Bugzilla is covered by the Mozilla Public License. See details at
   http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/.

   A.1.3. How do I get commercial support for Bugzilla?

   http://bugzilla.org/consulting.html is a list of people and companies
   who have asked us to list them as consultants for Bugzilla.

   http://www.collab.net/ offers Bugzilla as part of their standard
   offering to large projects. They do have some minimum fees that are
   pretty hefty, and generally aren't interested in small projects.

   There are several experienced Bugzilla hackers on the mailing
   list/newsgroup who are willing to make themselves available for
   generous compensation. Try sending a message to the mailing list
   asking for a volunteer.

   A.1.4. What major companies or projects are currently using Bugzilla
   for bug-tracking?

   There are dozens of major companies with public Bugzilla sites to
   track bugs in their products. We have a fairly complete list available
   on our website at http://bugzilla.org/installation_list.html. If you
   have an installation of Bugzilla and would like to be added to the
   list, whether it's a public install or not, simply e-mail Gerv
   <gerv@mozilla.org>. Keep in mind that it's kinda difficult to get onto
   the "high-profile" list ;).

   A.1.5. Who maintains Bugzilla?

   A core team, led by Dave Miller (justdave@bugzilla.org).

   A.1.6. How does Bugzilla stack up against other bug-tracking
   databases?

   We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against other
   defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please get in touch.
   However, from the author's personal experience with other
   bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers superior performance on commodity
   hardware, better price (free!), more developer- friendly features
   (such as stored queries, email integration, and platform
   independence), improved scalability, open source code, greater
   flexibility, and superior ease-of-use.

   If you happen to be a commercial bug-tracker vendor, please step
   forward with a list of advantages your product has over Bugzilla. We'd
   be happy to include it in the "Competitors" section.

   A.1.7. Why doesn't Bugzilla offer this or that feature or
   compatibility with this other tracking software?

   It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you have
   not yet found it. Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in usability,
   customizability, scalability, and user interface. It is widely
   considered the most complete and popular open-source bug-tracking
   software in existence.

   That doesn't mean it can't use improvement! You can help the project
   along by either hacking a patch yourself that supports the
   functionality you require, or else submitting a "Request for
   Enhancement" (RFE) using the bug submission interface at
   bugzilla.mozilla.org.

   A.1.8. Why MySQL? I'm interested in seeing Bugzilla run on
   Oracle/Sybase/Msql/PostgreSQL/MSSQL.

   MySQL was originally chosen because it is free, easy to install, and
   was available for the hardware Netscape intended to run it on.

   There is currently work in progress to make Bugzilla work on
   PostgreSQL and Sybase in the default distribution. You can track the
   progress of these initiatives in bug 98304 and bug 173130
   respectively.

   Once both of these are done, adding support for additional database
   servers should be trivial.

   A.1.9. What is /usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl?

   Bugzilla used to have the path to perl on the shebang line set to
   /usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl because when Terry first started writing the
   code for mozilla.org he needed a version of Perl and other tools that
   were completely under his control. This location was abandoned for the
   2.18 release in favor of the more sensible /usr/bin/perl. If you
   installed an older verion of Bugzilla and created the symlink we
   suggested, you can remove it now (provided that you don't have
   anything else, such as Bonsai, using it and you don't intend to
   reinstall an older version of Bugzilla).

   A.1.10. My perl is not located at /usr/bin/perl, is there an easy way
   to change it everywhere it needs to be changed?

   Yes, the following bit of perl magic will change all the shebang
   lines. Be sure to change /usr/local/bin/perl to your path to the perl
   binary.
   perl -pi -e 's@#\!/usr/bin/perl@#\!/usr/local/bin/perl@' *cgi *pl

   A.1.11. Is there an easy way to change the Bugzilla cookie name?

   At present, no.

2. Managerial Questions

   Note

        Questions likely to be asked by managers. :-)

   A.2.1. Is Bugzilla web-based, or do you have to have specific software
   or a specific operating system on your machine?

   It is web and e-mail based. You can edit bugs by sending specially
   formatted email to a properly configured Bugzilla, or control via the
   web.

   A.2.2. Can Bugzilla integrate with Perforce (SCM software)?

   Yes! You can find more information elsewhere in "The Bugzilla Guide"
   in the "Integration with Third-Party Products" section.

   A.2.3. Does Bugzilla allow the user to track multiple projects?

   Absolutely! You can track any number of Products that can each be
   composed of any number of Components.

   A.2.4. If I am on many projects, and search for all bugs assigned to
   me, will Bugzilla list them for me and allow me to sort by project,
   severity etc?

   Yes.

   A.2.5. Does Bugzilla allow attachments (text, screenshots, URLs etc)?
   If yes, are there any that are NOT allowed?

   Yes - any sort of attachment is allowed, although administrators can
   configure a maximum size. Bugzilla gives the user the option of either
   using the MIME-type supplied by the browser, choosing from a
   pre-defined list or manually typing any arbitrary MIME-type.

   A.2.6. Does Bugzilla allow us to define our own priorities and levels?
   Do we have complete freedom to change the labels of fields and format
   of them, and the choice of acceptable values?

   Yes. However, modifying some fields, notably those related to bug
   progression states, also require adjusting the program logic to
   compensate for the change.

   There is no GUI for adding fields to Bugzilla at this time. You can
   follow development of this feature in bug 91037

   A.2.7. Does Bugzilla provide any reporting features, metrics, graphs,
   etc? You know, the type of stuff that management likes to see. :)

   Yes. Look at http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/report.cgi for samples of
   what Bugzilla can do in reporting and graphing.

   If you can not get the reports you want from the included reporting
   scripts, it is possible to hook up a professional reporting package
   such as Crystal Reports using ODBC. If you choose to do this, beware
   that giving direct access to the database does contain some security
   implications. Even if you give read-only access to the bugs database
   it will bypass the secure bugs features of Bugzilla.

   A.2.8. Is there email notification and if so, what do you see when you
   get an email?

   Email notification is user-configurable. By default, the bug id and
   Summary of the bug report accompany each email notification, along
   with a list of the changes made.

   A.2.9. Can email notification be set up to send to multiple people,
   some on the To List, CC List, BCC List etc?

   Yes.

   A.2.10. Do users have to have any particular type of email
   application?

   Bugzilla email is sent in plain text, the most compatible mail format
   on the planet.

   Note

        If you decide to use the bugzilla_email integration features to allow
        Bugzilla to record responses to mail with the associated bug, you may
        need to caution your users to set their mailer to "respond to messages
        in the format in which they were sent". For security reasons Bugzilla
        ignores HTML tags in comments, and if a user sends HTML-based email
        into Bugzilla the resulting comment looks downright awful.

   A.2.11. Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had
   outsiders write up a bug report using a MS Word bug template, could
   that template be imported into "matching" fields? If I wanted to take
   the results of a query and export that data to MS Excel, could I do
   that?

   Bugzilla can output buglists as HTML (the default), CSV or RDF. The
   link for CSV can be found at the bottom of the buglist in HTML format.
   This CSV format can easily be imported into MS Excel or other
   spread-sheet applications.

   To use the RDF format of the buglist it is necessary to append a
   &ctype=rdf to the URL. RDF is meant to be machine readable and thus it
   is assumed that the URL would be generated progmatically so there is
   no user visible link to this format.

   Currently the only script included with Bugzilla that can import data
   is importxml.pl which is intended to be used for importing the data
   generated by the XML ctype of show_bug.cgi in association with bug
   moving. Any other use is left as an exercise for the user.

   There are also scripts included in the contrib/ directory for using
   e-mail to import information into Bugzilla, but these scripts are not
   currently supported and included for educational purposes.

   A.2.12. Has anyone converted Bugzilla to another language to be used
   in other countries? Is it localizable?

   Yes. For more information including available translated templates,
   see http://www.bugzilla.org/download.html#localizations. The admin
   interfaces are still not included in these translated templates and is
   therefore still English only. Also, there may be issues with the
   charset not being declared. See bug 126226 for more information.

   A.2.13. Can a user create and save reports? Can they do this in Word
   format? Excel format?

   Yes. No. Yes (using the CSV format).

   A.2.14. Does Bugzilla have the ability to search by word, phrase,
   compound search?

   You have no idea. Bugzilla's query interface, particularly with the
   advanced Boolean operators, is incredibly versatile.

   A.2.15. Does Bugzilla provide record locking when there is
   simultaneous access to the same bug? Does the second person get a
   notice that the bug is in use or how are they notified?

   Bugzilla does not lock records. It provides mid-air collision
   detection, and offers the offending user a choice of options to deal
   with the conflict.

   A.2.16. Are there any backup features provided?

   MySQL, the database back-end for Bugzilla, allows hot-backup of data.
   You can find strategies for dealing with backup considerations at
   http://www.mysql.com/doc/B/a/Backup.html.

   A.2.17. Can users be on the system while a backup is in progress?

   Yes. However, commits to the database must wait until the tables are
   unlocked. Bugzilla databases are typically very small, and backups
   routinely take less than a minute.

   A.2.18. What type of human resources are needed to be on staff to
   install and maintain Bugzilla? Specifically, what type of skills does
   the person need to have? I need to find out if we were to go with
   Bugzilla, what types of individuals would we need to hire and how much
   would that cost vs buying an "Out-of-the-Box" solution.

   If Bugzilla is set up correctly from the start, continuing maintenance
   needs are minimal and can be done easily using the web interface.

   Commercial Bug-tracking software typically costs somewhere upwards of
   $20,000 or more for 5-10 floating licenses. Bugzilla consultation is
   available from skilled members of the newsgroup. Simple questions are
   answered there and then.

   A.2.19. What time frame are we looking at if we decide to hire people
   to install and maintain the Bugzilla? Is this something that takes
   hours or weeks to install and a couple of hours per week to maintain
   and customize or is this a multi-week install process, plus a full
   time job for 1 person, 2 people, etc?

   It all depends on your level of commitment. Someone with much Bugzilla
   experience can get you up and running in less than a day, and your
   Bugzilla install can run untended for years. If your Bugzilla strategy
   is critical to your business workflow, hire somebody with reasonable
   UNIX or Perl skills to handle your process management and bug-tracking
   maintenance & customization.

   A.2.20. Is there any licensing fee or other fees for using Bugzilla?
   Any out-of-pocket cost other than the bodies needed as identified
   above?

   No. MySQL asks, if you find their product valuable, that you purchase
   a support contract from them that suits your needs.

3. Bugzilla Security

   A.3.1. How do I completely disable MySQL security if it's giving me
   problems (I've followed the instructions in the installation section
   of this guide)?

   Run MySQL like this: "mysqld --skip-grant-tables". Please remember
   this makes MySQL as secure as taping a $100 to the floor of a football
   stadium bathroom for safekeeping.

   A.3.2. Are there any security problems with Bugzilla?

   The Bugzilla code has undergone a reasonably complete security audit,
   and user-facing CGIs run under Perl's taint mode. However, it is
   recommended that you closely examine permissions on your Bugzilla
   installation, and follow the recommended security guidelines found in
   The Bugzilla Guide.

   A.3.3. I've implemented the security fixes mentioned in Chris Yeh's
   security advisory of 5/10/2000 advising not to run MySQL as root, and
   am running into problems with MySQL no longer working correctly.

   This is a common problem, related to running out of file descriptors.
   Simply add "ulimit -n unlimited" to the script which starts mysqld.

4. Bugzilla Email

   A.4.1. I have a user who doesn't want to receive any more email from
   Bugzilla. How do I stop it entirely for this user?

   The user should be able to set this in user email preferences (uncheck
   all boxes) or you can add their email address to the data/nomail file.

   A.4.2. I'm evaluating/testing Bugzilla, and don't want it to send
   email to anyone but me. How do I do it?

   Edit the "newchangedmail" Param. Replace "To:" with "X-Real-To:",
   replace "Cc:" with "X-Real-CC:", and add a "To: <youremailaddress>".

   A.4.3. I want whineatnews.pl to whine at something more, or other
   than, only new bugs. How do I do it?

   Try Klaas Freitag's excellent patch for "whineatassigned"
   functionality. You can find it in bug 6679. This patch is against an
   older version of Bugzilla, so you must apply the diffs manually.

   A.4.4. I don't like/want to use Procmail to hand mail off to
   bug_email.pl. What alternatives do I have?

   You can call bug_email.pl directly from your aliases file, with an
   entry like this:

     bugzilla-daemon: "|/usr/local/bin/bugzilla/contrib/bug_email.pl"

   However, this is fairly nasty and subject to problems; you also need
   to set up your smrsh (sendmail restricted shell) to allow it. In a
   pinch, though, it can work.

   A.4.5. How do I set up the email interface to submit/change bugs via
   email?

   You can find an updated README.mailif file in the contrib/ directory
   of your Bugzilla distribution that walks you through the setup.

   A.4.6. Email takes FOREVER to reach me from Bugzilla -- it's extremely
   slow. What gives?

   If you are using an alternate MTA, make sure the options given in
   Bugzilla/BugMail.pm and any other place where sendmail is called from
   are correct for your MTA. You should also ensure that the sendmailnow
   param is set to on.

   If you are using sendmail, try enabling sendmailnow in editparams.cgi.

   A.4.7. How come email from Bugzilla changes never reaches me?

   Double-check that you have not turned off email in your user
   preferences. Confirm that Bugzilla is able to send email by visiting
   the "Log In" link of your Bugzilla installation and clicking the
   "Email me a password" button after entering your email address.

   If you never receive mail from Bugzilla, chances you do not have
   sendmail in "/usr/lib/sendmail". Ensure sendmail lives in, or is
   symlinked to, "/usr/lib/sendmail".

5. Bugzilla Database

   A.5.1. I've heard Bugzilla can be used with Oracle?

   Red Hat's old version of Bugzilla (based on 2.8) worked on Oracle. Red
   Hat's newer version (based on 2.17.1 and soon to be merged into the
   main distribution) runs on PostgreSQL. At this time we know of no
   recent ports of Bugzilla to Oracle but do intend to support it in the
   future (possibly the 2.20 time-frame).

   A.5.2. I think my database might be corrupted, or contain invalid
   entries. What do I do?

   Run the "sanity check" utility (./sanitycheck.cgi in the Bugzilla_home
   directory) from your web browser to see! If it finishes without
   errors, you're probably OK. If it doesn't come back OK (i.e. any red
   letters), there are certain things Bugzilla can recover from and
   certain things it can't. If it can't auto-recover, I hope you're
   familiar with mysqladmin commands or have installed another way to
   manage your database. Sanity Check, although it is a good basic check
   on your database integrity, by no means is a substitute for competent
   database administration and avoiding deletion of data. It is not
   exhaustive, and was created to do a basic check for the most common
   problems in Bugzilla databases.

   A.5.3. I want to manually edit some entries in my database. How?

   There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also
   generally not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what
   you're doing. However, if you understand SQL you can use the mysql
   command line utility to manually insert, delete and modify table
   information. There are also more intuitive GUI clients available.
   Personal favorites of the Bugzilla team are phpMyAdmin and MySQL
   Control Center.

   A.5.4. I think I've set up MySQL permissions correctly, but Bugzilla
   still can't connect.

   Try running MySQL from its binary: "mysqld --skip-grant-tables". This
   will allow you to completely rule out grant tables as the cause of
   your frustration. If this Bugzilla is able to connect at this point
   then you need to check that you have granted proper permission to the
   user password combo defined in localconfig.

   Warning

           Running MySQL with this command line option is very insecure and
           should only be done when not connected to the external network as a
           troubleshooting step.

   A.5.5. How do I synchronize bug information among multiple different
   Bugzilla databases?

   Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs. Synchronization will
   only work one way -- you can create a read-only copy of the database
   at one site, and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main
   database.

   MySQL has some synchronization features builtin to the latest
   releases. It would be great if someone looked into the possibilities
   there and provided a report to the newsgroup on how to effectively
   synchronize two Bugzilla installations.

   If you simply need to transfer bugs from one Bugzilla to another,
   checkout the "move.pl" script in the Bugzilla distribution.

6. Bugzilla and Win32

   A.6.1. What is the easiest way to run Bugzilla on Win32
   (Win98+/NT/2K)?

   Remove Windows. Install Linux. Install Bugzilla. The boss will never
   know the difference.

   A.6.2. Is there a "Bundle::Bugzilla" equivalent for Win32?

   Not currently. Bundle::Bugzilla enormously simplifies Bugzilla
   installation on UNIX systems. If someone can volunteer to create a
   suitable PPM bundle for Win32, it would be appreciated.

   A.6.3. CGI's are failing with a "something.cgi is not a valid Windows
   NT application" error. Why?

   Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure
   the Web server to treat *.cgi files as CGI scripts. In IIS, you do
   this by adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with the <path>\perl.exe %s
   %s as the executable.

   Microsoft has some advice on this matter, as well:

     "Set application mappings. In the ISM, map the extension for the
     script file(s) to the executable for the script interpreter. For
     example, you might map the extension .py to Python.exe, the
     executable for the Python script interpreter. Note For the
     ActiveState Perl script interpreter, the extension .pl is
     associated with PerlIS.dll by default. If you want to change the
     association of .pl to perl.exe, you need to change the application
     mapping. In the mapping, you must add two percent (%) characters to
     the end of the pathname for perl.exe, as shown in this example:
     c:\perl\bin\perl.exe %s %s"

   A.6.4. I'm having trouble with the perl modules for NT not being able
   to talk to to the database.

   Your modules may be outdated or inaccurate. Try:

    1. Hitting http://www.activestate.com/ActivePerl
    2. Download ActivePerl
    3. Go to your prompt
    4. Type 'ppm'
    5. PPM> install DBI DBD-mysql GD

   I reckon TimeDate and Data::Dumper come with the activeperl. You can
   check the ActiveState site for packages for installation through PPM.
   http://www.activestate.com/Packages/.

7. Bugzilla Usage

   A.7.1. How do I change my user name (email address) in Bugzilla?

   New in 2.16 - go to the Account section of the Preferences. You will
   be emailed at both addresses for confirmation.

   A.7.2. The query page is very confusing. Isn't there a simpler way to
   query?

   The interface was simplified by a UI designer for 2.16. Further
   suggestions for improvement are welcome, but we won't sacrifice power
   for simplicity.

   A.7.3. I'm confused by the behavior of the "accept" button in the Show
   Bug form. Why doesn't it assign the bug to me when I accept it?

   The current behavior is acceptable to bugzilla.mozilla.org and most
   users. You have your choice of patches to change this behavior,
   however.

   Add a "and accept bug" radio button
   "Accept" button automatically assigns to you

   Note that these patches are somewhat dated. You will need to apply
   them manually.

   A.7.4. I can't upload anything into the database via the "Create
   Attachment" link. What am I doing wrong?

   The most likely cause is a very old browser or a browser that is
   incompatible with file upload via POST. Download the latest Netscape,
   Microsoft, or Mozilla browser to handle uploads correctly.

   A.7.5. How do I change a keyword in Bugzilla, once some bugs are using
   it?

   In the Bugzilla administrator UI, edit the keyword and it will let you
   replace the old keyword name with a new one. This will cause a problem
   with the keyword cache. Run sanitycheck.cgi to fix it.

8. Bugzilla Hacking

   A.8.1. What kind of style should I use for templatization?

   Gerv and Myk suggest a 2-space indent, with embedded code sections on
   their own line, in line with outer tags. Like this:
   <fred>
   [% IF foo %]
     <bar>
     [% FOREACH x = barney %]
       <tr>
         <td>
           [% x %]
         </td>
       <tr>
     [% END %]
   [% END %]
   </fred>

   Myk also recommends you turn on PRE_CHOMP in the template
   initialization to prevent bloating of HTML with unnecessary
   whitespace.

   Please note that many have differing opinions on this subject, and the
   existing templates in Bugzilla espouse both this and a 4-space style.
   Either is acceptable; the above is preferred.

   A.8.2. What bugs are in Bugzilla right now?

   Try this link to view current bugs or requests for enhancement for
   Bugzilla.

   You can view bugs marked for 2.18 release here. This list includes
   bugs for the 2.18 release that have already been fixed and checked
   into CVS. Please consult the Bugzilla Project Page for details on how
   to check current sources out of CVS so you can have these bug fixes
   early!

   A.8.3. How can I change the default priority to a null value? For
   instance, have the default priority be "---" instead of "P2"?

   This is well-documented in bug 49862. Ultimately, it's as easy as
   adding the "---" priority field to your localconfig file in the
   appropriate area, re-running checksetup.pl, and then changing the
   default priority in your browser using "editparams.cgi".

   A.8.4. What's the best way to submit patches? What guidelines should I
   follow?

    1. Enter a bug into bugzilla.mozilla.org for the "Bugzilla" product.
    2. Upload your patch as a unified diff (having used "diff -u" against
       the current sources checked out of CVS), or new source file by
       clicking "Create a new attachment" link on the bug page you've
       just created, and include any descriptions of database changes you
       may make, into the bug ID you submitted in step #1. Be sure and
       click the "Patch" checkbox to indicate the text you are sending is
       a patch!
    3. Announce your patch and the associated URL
       (http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=XXXXXX) for
       discussion in the newsgroup (netscape.public.mozilla.webtools).
       You'll get a really good, fairly immediate reaction to the
       implications of your patch, which will also give us an idea how
       well-received the change would be.
    4. If it passes muster with minimal modification, the person to whom
       the bug is assigned in Bugzilla is responsible for seeing the
       patch is checked into CVS.
    5. Bask in the glory of the fact that you helped write the most
       successful open-source bug-tracking software on the planet :)

Appendix B. The Bugzilla Database

   Note

        This document really needs to be updated with more fleshed out
        information about primary keys, interrelationships, and maybe some
        nifty tables to document dependencies. Any takers?
     _________________________________________________________________

B.1. Modifying Your Running System

   Bugzilla optimizes database lookups by storing all relatively static
   information in the versioncache file, located in the data/
   subdirectory under your installation directory.

   If you make a change to the structural data in your database (the
   versions table for example), or to the "constants" encoded in
   defparams.pl, you will need to remove the cached content from the data
   directory (by doing a "rm data/versioncache" ), or your changes won't
   show up.

   versioncache gets automatically regenerated whenever it's more than an
   hour old, so Bugzilla will eventually notice your changes by itself,
   but generally you want it to notice right away, so that you can test
   things.
     _________________________________________________________________

B.2. MySQL Bugzilla Database Introduction

   This information comes straight from my life. I was forced to learn
   how Bugzilla organizes database because of nitpicky requests from
   users for tiny changes in wording, rather than having people
   re-educate themselves or figure out how to work our procedures around
   the tool. It sucks, but it can and will happen to you, so learn how
   the schema works and deal with it when it comes.

   So, here you are with your brand-new installation of Bugzilla. You've
   got MySQL set up, Apache working right, Perl DBI and DBD talking to
   the database flawlessly. Maybe you've even entered a few test bugs to
   make sure email's working; people seem to be notified of new bugs and
   changes, and you can enter and edit bugs to your heart's content.
   Perhaps you've gone through the trouble of setting up a gateway for
   people to submit bugs to your database via email, have had a few
   people test it, and received rave reviews from your beta testers.

   What's the next thing you do? Outline a training strategy for your
   development team, of course, and bring them up to speed on the new
   tool you've labored over for hours.

   Your first training session starts off very well! You have a captive
   audience which seems enraptured by the efficiency embodied in this
   thing called "Bugzilla". You are caught up describing the nifty
   features, how people can save favorite queries in the database, set
   them up as headers and footers on their pages, customize their
   layouts, generate reports, track status with greater efficiency than
   ever before, leap tall buildings with a single bound and rescue Jane
   from the clutches of Certain Death!

   But Certain Death speaks up -- a tiny voice, from the dark corners of
   the conference room. "I have a concern," the voice hisses from the
   darkness, "about the use of the word 'verified'."

   The room, previously filled with happy chatter, lapses into
   reverential silence as Certain Death (better known as the Vice
   President of Software Engineering) continues. "You see, for two years
   we've used the word 'verified' to indicate that a developer or quality
   assurance engineer has confirmed that, in fact, a bug is valid. I
   don't want to lose two years of training to a new software product.
   You need to change the bug status of 'verified' to 'approved' as soon
   as possible. To avoid confusion, of course."

   Oh no! Terror strikes your heart, as you find yourself mumbling "yes,
   yes, I don't think that would be a problem," You review the changes
   with Certain Death, and continue to jabber on, "no, it's not too big a
   change. I mean, we have the source code, right? You know, 'Use the
   Source, Luke' and all that... no problem," All the while you quiver
   inside like a beached jellyfish bubbling, burbling, and boiling on a
   hot Jamaican sand dune...

   Thus begins your adventure into the heart of Bugzilla. You've been
   forced to learn about non-portable enum() fields, varchar columns, and
   tinyint definitions. The Adventure Awaits You!
     _________________________________________________________________

B.2.1. Bugzilla Database Basics

   If you were like me, at this point you're totally clueless about the
   internals of MySQL, and if it weren't for this executive order from
   the Vice President you couldn't care less about the difference between
   a "bigint" and a "tinyint" entry in MySQL. I recommend you refer to
   the MySQL documentation . Below are the basics you need to know about
   the Bugzilla database. Check the chart above for more details.

    1. To connect to your database:
       bash# mysql -u root
       If this works without asking you for a password, shame on you !
       You should have locked your security down like the installation
       instructions told you to. You can find details on locking down
       your database in the Bugzilla FAQ in this directory (under
       "Security"), or more robust security generalities in the MySQL
       searchable documentation.
    2. You should now be at a prompt that looks like this:
       mysql>
       At the prompt, if "bugs" is the name you chose in the localconfig
       file for your Bugzilla database, type:
       mysql use bugs;
     _________________________________________________________________

B.2.1.1. Bugzilla Database Tables

   Imagine your MySQL database as a series of spreadsheets, and you won't
   be too far off. If you use this command:

   mysql> show tables from bugs;

   you'll be able to see the names of all the "spreadsheets" (tables) in
   your database.

   From the command issued above, ou should have some output that looks
   like this:
   +-------------------+
   | Tables in bugs    |
   +-------------------+
   | attachments       |
   | bugs              |
   | bugs_activity     |
   | cc                |
   | components        |
   | dependencies      |
   | fielddefs         |
   | groups            |
   | keyworddefs       |
   | keywords          |
   | logincookies      |
   | longdescs         |
   | milestones        |
   | namedqueries      |
   | products          |
   | profiles          |
   | profiles_activity |
   | tokens            |
   | versions          |
   | votes             |
   | watch             |
   +-------------------+

     Here's an overview of what each table does. Most columns in each tab
   le have
   descriptive names that make it fairly trivial to figure out their jobs
   .
   attachments: This table stores all attachments to bugs. It tends to be
    your
   largest table, yet also generally has the fewest entries because file
   attachments are so (relatively) large.
   bugs:  This is the core of your system. The bugs table stores most of
   the
   current information about a bug, with the exception of the info stored
    in the
   other tables.
   bugs_activity:  This stores information regarding what changes are mad
   e to bugs
   when -- a history file.
   cc:  This tiny table simply stores all the CC information for any bug
   which has
   any entries in the CC field of the bug. Note that, like most other tab
   les in
   Bugzilla, it does not refer to users by their user names, but by their
    unique
   userid, stored as a primary key in the profiles table.
   components: This stores the programs and components (or products and
   components, in newer Bugzilla parlance) for Bugzilla. Curiously, the "
   program"
   (product) field is the full name of the product, rather than some othe
   r unique
   identifier, like bug_id and user_id are elsewhere in the database.
   dependencies: Stores data about those cool dependency trees.
   fielddefs:  A nifty table that defines other tables. For instance, whe
   n you
   submit a form that changes the value of "AssignedTo" this table allows
   translation to the actual field name "assigned_to" for entry into MySQ
   L.
   groups:  defines bitmasks for groups. A bitmask is a number that can u
   niquely
   identify group memberships. For instance, say the group that is allowe
   d to
   tweak parameters is assigned a value of "1", the group that is allowed
    to edit
   users is assigned a "2", and the group that is allowed to create new g
   roups is
   assigned the bitmask of "4". By uniquely combining the group bitmasks
   (much
   like the chmod command in UNIX,) you can identify a user is allowed to
    tweak
   parameters and create groups, but not edit users, by giving him a bitm
   ask of
   "5", or a user allowed to edit users and create groups, but not tweak
   parameters, by giving him a bitmask of "6" Simple, huh?
     If this makes no sense to you, try this at the mysql prompt:
   mysql> select * from groups;
     You'll see the list, it makes much more sense that way.
   keyworddefs:  Definitions of keywords to be used
   keywords: Unlike what you'd think, this table holds which keywords are
   associated with which bug id's.
   logincookies: This stores every login cookie ever assigned to you for
   every
   machine you've ever logged into Bugzilla from. Curiously, it never doe
   s any
   housecleaning -- I see cookies in this file I've not used for months.
   However,
   since Bugzilla never expires your cookie (for convenience' sake), it m
   akes
   sense.
   longdescs:  The meat of bugzilla -- here is where all user comments ar
   e stored!
   You've only got 2^24 bytes per comment (it's a mediumtext field), so s
   peak
   sparingly -- that's only the amount of space the Old Testament from th
   e Bible
   would take (uncompressed, 16 megabytes). Each comment is keyed to the
   bug_id to which it's attached, so the order is necessarily chronologic
   al, for
   comments are played back in the order in which they are received.
   milestones:  Interesting that milestones are associated with a specifi
   c product
   in this table, but Bugzilla does not yet support differing milestones
   by
   product through the standard configuration interfaces.
   namedqueries:  This is where everybody stores their "custom queries".
   Very
   cool feature; it beats the tar out of having to bookmark each cool que
   ry you
   construct.
   products:  What products you have, whether new bug entries are allowed
    for the
   product, what milestone you're working toward on that product, votes,
   etc. It
   will be nice when the components table supports these same features, s
   o you
   could close a particular component for bug entry without having to clo
   se an
   entire product...
   profiles:  Ahh, so you were wondering where your precious user informa
   tion was
   stored?  Here it is!  With the passwords in plain text for all to see!
    (but
   sshh... don't tell your users!)
   profiles_activity:  Need to know who did what when to who's profile?
   This'll
   tell you, it's a pretty complete history.
   versions:  Version information for every product
   votes:  Who voted for what when
   watch:  Who (according to userid) is watching who's bugs (according to
    their
   userid).
   ===
   THE DETAILS
   ===
     Ahh, so you're wondering just what to do with the information above?
     At the
   mysql prompt, you can view any information about the columns in a tabl
   e with
   this command (where "table" is the name of the table you wish to view)
   :
   mysql> show columns from table;
     You can also view all the data in a table with this command:
   mysql> select * from table;
     -- note: this is a very bad idea to do on, for instance, the "bugs"
   table if
   you have 50,000 bugs. You'll be sitting there a while until you ctrl-c
    or
   50,000 bugs play across your screen.
     You can limit the display from above a little with the command, wher
   e
   "column" is the name of the column for which you wish to restrict info
   rmation:
   mysql> select * from table where (column = "some info");
     -- or the reverse of this
   mysql> select * from table where (column != "some info");
     Let's take our example from the introduction, and assume you need to
    change
   the word "verified" to "approved" in the resolution field. We know fro
   m the
   above information that the resolution is likely to be stored in the "b
   ugs"
   table. Note we'll need to change a little perl code as well as this da
   tabase
   change, but I won't plunge into that in this document. Let's verify th
   e
   information is stored in the "bugs" table:
   mysql> show columns from bugs
     (exceedingly long output truncated here)
   | bug_status| enum('UNCONFIRMED','NEW','ASSIGNED','REOPENED','RESOLVED
   ','VERIFIED','CLOSED')||MUL | UNCONFIRMED||
     Sorry about that long line. We see from this that the "bug status" c
   olumn is
   an "enum field", which is a MySQL peculiarity where a string type fiel
   d can
   only have certain types of entries. While I think this is very cool, i
   t's not
   standard SQL. Anyway, we need to add the possible enum field entry
   'APPROVED' by altering the "bugs" table.
   mysql> ALTER table bugs CHANGE bug_status bug_status
       -> enum("UNCONFIRMED", "NEW", "ASSIGNED", "REOPENED", "RESOLVED",
       -> "VERIFIED", "APPROVED", "CLOSED") not null;
       (note we can take three lines or more -- whatever you put in befor
   e the
   semicolon is evaluated as a single expression)
   Now if you do this:
   mysql> show columns from bugs;
     you'll see that the bug_status field has an extra "APPROVED" enum th
   at's
   available!  Cool thing, too, is that this is reflected on your query p
   age as
   well -- you can query by the new status. But how's it fit into the exi
   sting
   scheme of things?
     Looks like you need to go back and look for instances of the word "v
   erified"
   in the perl code for Bugzilla -- wherever you find "verified", change
   it to
   "approved" and you're in business (make sure that's a case-insensitive
    search).
   Although you can query by the enum field, you can't give something a s
   tatus
   of "APPROVED" until you make the perl changes. Note that this change I
   mentioned can also be done by editing checksetup.pl, which automates a
    lot of
   this. But you need to know this stuff anyway, right?

Appendix C. Useful Patches and Utilities for Bugzilla

   Are you looking for a way to put your Bugzilla into overdrive? Catch
   some of the niftiest tricks here in this section.
     _________________________________________________________________

C.1. Apache mod_rewrite magic

   Apache's mod_rewrite module lets you do some truly amazing things with
   URL rewriting. Here are a couple of examples of what you can do.

    1. Make it so if someone types http://www.foo.com/12345 , Bugzilla
       spits back http://www.foo.com/show_bug.cgi?id=12345. Try setting
       up your VirtualHost section for Bugzilla with a rule like this:

       <VirtualHost 12.34.56.78>
       RewriteEngine On
       RewriteRule ^/([0-9]+)$ http://foo.bar.com/show_bug.cgi?id=$1 [L,R]
       </VirtualHost>

    2. There are many, many more things you can do with mod_rewrite.
       Please refer to the mod_rewrite documentation at
       http://www.apache.org.
     _________________________________________________________________

C.2. Command-line Bugzilla Queries

   There are a suite of Unix utilities for querying Bugzilla from the
   command line. They live in the contrib/cmdline directory. However,
   they have not yet been updated to work with 2.16
   (post-templatisation.). There are three files - query.conf, buglist
   and bugs.

   query.conf contains the mapping from options to field names and
   comparison types. Quoted option names are "grepped" for, so it should
   be easy to edit this file. Comments (#) have no effect; you must make
   sure these lines do not contain any quoted "option".

   buglist is a shell script which submits a Bugzilla query and writes
   the resulting HTML page to stdout. It supports both short options,
   (such as "-Afoo" or "-Rbar") and long options (such as
   "--assignedto=foo" or "--reporter=bar"). If the first character of an
   option is not "-", it is treated as if it were prefixed with
   "--default=".

   The column list is taken from the COLUMNLIST environment variable.
   This is equivalent to the "Change Columns" option when you list bugs
   in buglist.cgi. If you have already used Bugzilla, grep for COLUMNLIST
   in your cookies file to see your current COLUMNLIST setting.

   bugs is a simple shell script which calls buglist and extracts the bug
   numbers from the output. Adding the prefix
   "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=" turns the bug list
   into a working link if any bugs are found. Counting bugs is easy. Pipe
   the results through sed -e 's/,/ /g' | wc | awk '{printf $2 "\n"}'

   Akkana Peck says she has good results piping buglist output through
   w3m -T text/html -dump

Appendix D. Bugzilla Variants and Competitors

   I created this section to answer questions about Bugzilla competitors
   and variants, then found a wonderful site which covers an awful lot of
   what I wanted to discuss. Rather than quote it in its entirety, I'll
   simply refer you here: http://linas.org/linux/pm.html.
     _________________________________________________________________

D.1. Red Hat Bugzilla

   Red Hat's old fork of Bugzilla which was based on version 2.8 is now
   obsolete. The newest version in use is based on version 2.17.1 and is
   in the process of being integrated into the main Bugzilla source tree.
   The back-end is modified to work with PostgreSQL instead of MySQL and
   they have custom templates to get their desired look and feel, but
   other than that it is Bugzilla 2.17.1. Dave Lawrence of Red Hat put
   forth a great deal of effort to make sure that the changes he made
   could be integrated back into the main tree. Bug 98304 exists to track
   this integration.

D.2. Loki Bugzilla (Fenris)

   Fenris was a fork from Bugzilla made by Loki Games; when Loki went
   into receivership, it died. While Loki's other code lives on, its
   custodians recommend Bugzilla for future bug-tracker deployments.

     _________________________________________________________________

D.3. Issuezilla

   Issuezilla was another fork from Bugzilla, made by collab.net and
   hosted at tigris.org. It is also dead; the primary focus of
   bug-tracking at tigris.org is their Java-based bug-tracker, Section
   D.4.

   This section last updated 27 Jul 2002

   the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
   modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
   this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
   credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
   modifications made by others.

   This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
   works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
   complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
   license designed for free software.

   We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
   software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
   program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
   software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
   can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
   whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License
   principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.
     _________________________________________________________________

1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

   This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
   notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
   under the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any
   such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
   addressed as "you".

   A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
   Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
   modifications and/or translated into another language.

   A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
   the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
   publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall
   subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall
   directly within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is
   in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain
   any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical
   connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
   commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
   them.

   The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
   are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
   that says that the Document is released under this License.

   The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are listed,
   as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
   the Document is released under this License.

   A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
   represented in a format whose specification is available to the
   general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
   straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
   pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
   drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
   for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
   to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
   format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
   subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is
   not "Transparent" is called "Opaque".

   Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
   ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML
   or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple
   HTML designed for human modification. Opaque formats include
   PostScript, PDF, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only
   by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or
   processing tools are not generally available, and the
   machine-generated HTML produced by some word processors for output
   purposes only.

   The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
   plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
   this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in
   formats which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means
   the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
   preceding the beginning of the body of the text.
     _________________________________________________________________

2. VERBATIM COPYING

   You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
   commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
   copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
   to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no
   other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use
   technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
   copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept
   compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough
   number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

   You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
   you may publicly display copies.
     _________________________________________________________________

3. COPYING IN QUANTITY

   If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
   and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
   enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all
   these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and
   Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and
   legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover
   must present the full title with all words of the title equally
   prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in
   addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they
   preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can
   be treated as verbatim copying in other respects.

   If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
   legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
   reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
   pages.

   If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
   more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
   copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
   a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
   Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
   general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
   charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
   option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
   distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
   Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
   until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
   copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
   the public.

   It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
   Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
   give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
   Document.
     _________________________________________________________________

4. MODIFICATIONS

   You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
   the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
   the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
   Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
   and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
   of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

    A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
       from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
       (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
       of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version
       if the original publisher of that version gives permission.
    B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or
       entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the
       Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal
       authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has
       less than five).
    C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified
       Version, as the publisher.
    D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.
    E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
       adjacent to the other copyright notices.
    F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
       giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
       terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.
    G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant
       Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license
       notice.
    H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.
    I. Preserve the section entitled "History", and its title, and add to
       it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
       publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If
       there is no section entitled "History" in the Document, create one
       stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
       given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
       Version as stated in the previous sentence.
    J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
       public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
       the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
       it was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You
       may omit a network location for a work that was published at least
       four years before the Document itself, or if the original
       publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.
    K. In any section entitled "Acknowledgements" or "Dedications",
       preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
       substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements
       and/or dedications given therein.
    L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in
       their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent
       are not considered part of the section titles.
    M. Delete any section entitled "Endorsements". Such a section may not
       be included in the Modified Version.
    N. Do not retitle any existing section as "Endorsements" or to
       conflict in title with any Invariant Section.

   If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
   appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
   copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
   of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the
   list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice.
   These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

   You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
   nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
   parties--for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
   been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
   standard.

   You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
   passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
   of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
   Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
   through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already
   includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
   by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
   you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
   permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

   The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
   give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
   imply endorsement of any Modified Version.
     _________________________________________________________________

5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS

   You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
   License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
   versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
   Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
   list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
   license notice.

   The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
   multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
   copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
   different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
   adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
   author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.
   Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
   Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

   In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled "History"
   in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
   "History"; likewise combine any sections entitled "Acknowledgements",
   and any sections entitled "Dedications". You must delete all sections
   entitled "Endorsements."
     _________________________________________________________________

6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

   You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other
   documents released under this License, and replace the individual
   copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy
   that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules
   of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all
   other respects.

   You may extract a single document from such a collection, and
   distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a
   copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this
   License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that
   document.
     _________________________________________________________________

7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

   A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
   and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
   distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
   of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
   compilation. Such a compilation is called an "aggregate", and this
   License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
   with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
   are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

   If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
   copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
   of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
   covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. Otherwise
   they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.
     _________________________________________________________________

8. TRANSLATION

   Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
   distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.
   Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
   permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
   translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
   original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a
   translation of this License provided that you also include the
   original English version of this License. In case of a disagreement
   between the translation and the original English version of this
   License, the original English version will prevail.
     _________________________________________________________________

9. TERMINATION

   You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document
   except as expressly provided for under this License. Any other attempt
   to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and
   will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However,
   parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
   License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
   parties remain in full compliance.
     _________________________________________________________________

10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

   The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the
   GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions
   will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in
   detail to address new problems or concerns. See
   http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/.

   Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.
   If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
   License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the option of
   following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
   of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
   Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version
   number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
   as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
     _________________________________________________________________

How to use this License for your documents

   To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
   the License in the document and put the following copyright and
   license notices just after the title page:

     Copyright (c) YEAR YOUR NAME. Permission is granted to copy,
     distribute and/or modify this document under the terms of the GNU
     Free Documentation License, Version 1.1 or any later version
     published by the Free Software Foundation; with the Invariant
     Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES, with the Front-Cover Texts being
     LIST, and with the Back-Cover Texts being LIST. A copy of the
     license is included in the section entitled "GNU Free Documentation
     License".

   If you have no Invariant Sections, write "with no Invariant Sections"
   instead of saying which ones are invariant. If you have no Front-Cover
   Texts, write "no Front-Cover Texts" instead of "Front-Cover Texts
   being LIST"; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
   recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
   free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to
   permit their use in free software.

Glossary

0-9, high ascii

   .htaccess
          Apache web server, and other NCSA-compliant web servers,
          observe the convention of using files in directories called
          .htaccess to restrict access to certain files. In Bugzilla,
          they are used to keep secret files which would otherwise
          compromise your installation - e.g. the localconfig file
          contains the password to your database. curious.

A

   Apache
          In this context, Apache is the web server most commonly used
          for serving up Bugzilla pages. Contrary to popular belief, the
          apache web server has nothing to do with the ancient and noble
          Native American tribe, but instead derived its name from the
          fact that it was "a patchy" version of the original NCSA
          world-wide-web server.

          Useful Directives when configuring Bugzilla

        AddHandler
                Tell Apache that it's OK to run CGI scripts.

        AllowOverride, Options
                These directives are used to tell Apache many things
                about the directory they apply to. For Bugzilla's
                purposes, we need them to allow script execution and
                .htaccess overrides.

        DirectoryIndex
                Used to tell Apache what files are indexes. If you can
                not add index.cgi to the list of valid files, you'll need
                to set $index_html to 1 in localconfig so ./checksetup.pl
                will create an index.html that redirects to index.cgi.

        ScriptInterpreterSource
                Used when running Apache on windows so the shebang line
                doesn't have to be changed in every Bugzilla script.

          For more information about how to configure Apache for
          Bugzilla, see Section 4.4.1.

B

   Bug
          A "bug" in Bugzilla refers to an issue entered into the
          database which has an associated number, assignments, comments,
          etc. Some also refer to a "tickets" or "issues"; in the context
          of Bugzilla, they are synonymous.

   Bug Number
          Each Bugzilla bug is assigned a number that uniquely identifies
          that bug. The bug associated with a bug number can be pulled up
          via a query, or easily from the very front page by typing the
          number in the "Find" box.

   Bugzilla
          Bugzilla is the world-leading free software bug tracking
          system.

C

   Common Gateway Interface (CGI)
          CGI is an acronym for Common Gateway Interface. This is a
          standard for interfacing an external application with a web
          server. Bugzilla is an example of a CGI application.

   Component
          A Component is a subsection of a Product. It should be a narrow
          category, tailored to your organization. All Products must
          contain at least one Component (and, as a matter of fact,
          creating a Product with no Components will create an error in
          Bugzilla).

   Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN)
          CPAN stands for the "Comprehensive Perl Archive Network". CPAN
          maintains a large number of extremely useful Perl modules -
          encapsulated chunks of code for performing a particular task.

   contrib
          The contrib directory is a location to put scripts that have
          been contributed to Bugzilla but are not a part of the official
          distribution. These scripts are written by third parties and
          may be in languages other than perl. For those that are in
          perl, there may be additional modules or other requirements
          than those of the offical distribution.

       Note

            Scripts in the contrib directory are not offically supported by the
            Bugzilla team and may break in between versions.

D

   daemon
          A daemon is a computer program which runs in the background. In
          general, most daemons are started at boot time via System V
          init scripts, or through RC scripts on BSD-based systems.
          mysqld, the MySQL server, and apache, a web server, are
          generally run as daemons.

G

   Groups
          The word "Groups" has a very special meaning to Bugzilla.
          Bugzilla's main security mechanism comes by placing users in
          groups, and assigning those groups certain privileges to view
          bugs in particular Products in the Bugzilla database.

J

   JavaScript
          JavaScript is cool, we should talk about it.

M

   Message Transport Agent (MTA)
          A Message Transport Agent is used to control the flow of email
          on a system. Many unix based systems use sendmail which is what
          Bugzilla expects to find by default at /usr/sbin/sendmail. Many
          other MTA's will work, but they all require that the
          sendmailnow param be set to on.

   MySQL
          MySQL is currently the required RDBMS for Bugzilla. MySQL can
          be downloaded from http://www.mysql.com. While you should
          familiarize yourself with all of the documentation, some high
          points are:

        Backup
                Methods for backing up your Bugzilla database.

        Option Files
                Information about how to configure MySQL using my.cnf.

        Privilege System
                Much more detailed information about the suggestions in
                Section 5.6.2.

   Product
          A Product is a broad category of types of bugs, normally
          representing a single piece of software or entity. In general,
          there are several Components to a Product. A Product may define
          a group (used for security) for all bugs entered into its
          Components.

   Perl
          First written by Larry Wall, Perl is a remarkable program
          language. It has the benefits of the flexibility of an
          interpreted scripting language (such as shell script), combined
          with the speed and power of a compiled language, such as C.
          Bugzilla is maintained in Perl.

Q

   QA
          "QA", "Q/A", and "Q.A." are short for "Quality Assurance". In
          most large software development organizations, there is a team
          devoted to ensuring the product meets minimum standards before
          shipping. This team will also generally want to track the
          progress of bugs over their life cycle, thus the need for the
          "QA Contact" field in a bug.

R

   Relational DataBase Managment System (RDBMS)
          A relational database management system is a database system
          that stores information in tables that are related to each
          other.

   Regular Expression (regexp)
          A regular expression is an expression used for pattern
          matching. Documentation

S

   SGML
          SGML stands for "Standard Generalized Markup Language". Created
          in the 1980's to provide an extensible means to maintain
          documentation based upon content instead of presentation, SGML
          has withstood the test of time as a robust, powerful language.
          XML is the "baby brother" of SGML; any valid XML document it,
          by definition, a valid SGML document. The document you are
          reading is written and maintained in SGML, and is also valid
          XML if you modify the Document Type Definition.

T

   Target Milestone
          Target Milestones are Product goals. They are configurable on a
          per-Product basis. Most software development houses have a
          concept of "milestones" where the people funding a project
          expect certain functionality on certain dates. Bugzilla
          facilitates meeting these milestones by giving you the ability
          to declare by which milestone a bug will be fixed, or an
          enhancement will be implemented.

   Tool Command Language (TCL)
          TCL is an open source scripting language available for Windows,
          Macintosh, and Unix based systems. Bugzilla 1.0 was written in
          TCL but never released. The first release of Bugzilla was 2.0,
          which was when it was ported to perl.

Z

   Zarro Boogs Found
          This is just a goofy way of saying that there were no bugs
          found matching your query. When asked to explain this message,
          Terry had the following to say:



         I've been asked to explain this ... way back when, when Netscape
         released version 4.0 of its browser, we had a release party.
         Naturally, there had been a big push to try and fix every known bug
         before the release. Naturally, that hadn't actually happened. (This is
         not unique to Netscape or to 4.0; the same thing has happened with
         every software project I've ever seen.) Anyway, at the release party,
         T-shirts were handed out that said something like "Netscape 4.0: Zarro
         Boogs". Just like the software, the T-shirt had no known bugs. Uh-huh.
         So, when you query for a list of bugs, and it gets no results, you can
         think of this as a friendly reminder. Of *course* there are bugs
         matching your query, they just aren't in the bugsystem yet...
