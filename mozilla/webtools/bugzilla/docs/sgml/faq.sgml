	  <para>
	    <ulink url="http://www.collab.net/">www.collab.net</ulink> offers
	    Bugzilla as part of their standard offering to large projects.
	    They do have some minimum fees that are pretty hefty, and generally

	  <para>
	    Who maintains Bugzilla?

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    A 
      <ulink url="http://www.bugzilla.org/who_we_are.html">core team</ulink>,
      led by Dave Miller (justdave@syndicomm.com).

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    How does Bugzilla stack up against other bug-tracking databases?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
	    other defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please
      get in touch. However, from the author's personal
	    experience with other bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers
	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
	    (free!), more developer- friendly features (such as stored
	    queries, email integration, and platform independence),
	    improved scalability, open source code, greater
	    flexibility, and superior ease-of-use.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you happen to be a commercial bug-tracker vendor, please
	    step forward with a list of advantages your product has over
      Bugzilla. We'd be happy to include it in the "Competitors"
      section.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Why doesn't Bugzilla offer this or that feature or compatability
	    with this other tracking software?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it.  Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in
	    usability, customizability, scalability, and user interface.  It
	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source
	    bug-tracking software in existence.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    That doesn't mean it can't use improvement!
	    You can help the project along by either hacking a patch yourself
	    that supports the functionality you require, or else submitting a
	    "Request for Enhancement" (RFE) using the bug submission interface
	    at <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla">bugzilla.mozilla.org</ulink>.

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Why MySQL?  I'm interested in seeing Bugzilla run on
	    Oracle/Sybase/Msql/PostgreSQL/MSSQL.
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
      There is DB-independence work afoot. PostgreSQL support is planned
      for 2.18, and full DB-independence can't be far further on.
	  </para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Why do the scripts say "/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl" instead of
	    "/usr/bin/perl" or something else?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	     Mozilla.org uses /usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl, because originally
       Terry wanted a place to put a version of Perl and other tools 
       that was strictly under his control. 
    </para>
		<para>
		  We always recommend that, if possible, you keep the path
		  as /usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl, and simply add symlink.  
      This will make upgrading
		  your Bugzilla much easier in the future.

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Is Bugzilla web-based, or do you have to have specific software or
	    a specific operating system on your machine?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    It is web and e-mail based.  You can edit bugs by sending specially
	    formatted email to a properly configured Bugzilla, or control via the web.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Can Bugzilla integrate with
	    Perforce (SCM software)?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes!  You can find more information elsewhere in "The Bugzilla
	    Guide" in the "Integration with Third-Party Products" section.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow the user to track multiple projects?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Absolutely!  You can track any number of Products (although you
      are limited to about 55 or so if
      you are using Product-Based Groups), that can each be composed of any
      number of Components.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    If I am on many projects, and search for all bugs assigned to me, will
	    Bugzilla list them for me and allow me to sort by project, severity etc?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow attachments (text, screenshots, URLs etc)? If yes,
	    are there any that are NOT allowed?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes - any sort of attachment is allowed, although administrators can
      configure a maximum size.  
      There are many specific MIME-types that are pre-defined by Bugzilla,
	    but you may specify any arbitrary MIME-type you need when you
	    upload the file. 
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow us to define our own priorities and levels? Do we
	    have complete freedom to change the labels of fields and format of them, and
	    the choice of acceptable values?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  However, modifying some fields, notably those related to bug
	    progression states, also require adjusting the program logic to
	    compensate for the change.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    There is no GUI for adding fields to Bugzilla at this
	    time.  You can follow development of this feature at
	    <ulink
		   url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91037">http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91037</ulink>

      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla provide any reporting features, metrics, graphs, etc? You
	    know, the type of stuff that management likes to see. :)
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  Look at <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/reports.cgi">
	    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/reports.cgi</ulink> for basic reporting
	    and graphing facilities.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    For more advanced reporting, I recommend hooking up a professional
	    reporting package, such as Crystal Reports, and use ODBC to access
	    the MySQL database.  You can do a lot through the Query page of
	    Bugzilla as well, but right now Advanced Reporting is much
	    better accomplished through third-party utilities that can
	    interface with the database directly.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Is there email notification and if so, what do you see when you get an
	    email?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Email notification is user-configurable.  By default, the bug id and 
      Summary of the bug report accompany each email notification, along with
	    a list of the changes made.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Can email notification be set up to send to multiple
	    people, some on the To List, CC List, BCC List etc?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Do users have to have any particular
	    type of email application?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Bugzilla email is sent in plain text, the most compatible mail format
	    on the planet.
	    <note>
	      <para>
		If you decide to use the bugzilla_email integration features
		to allow Bugzilla to record responses to mail with the associated bug,
		you may need to caution your users to set their mailer to "respond
		to messages in the format in which they were sent".  For security reasons
		Bugzilla ignores HTML tags in comments, and if a user sends HTML-based
		email into Bugzilla the resulting comment looks downright awful.
	      </para>

	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had outsiders
	    write up a bug report using a MS Word bug template, could that template be
	    imported into "matching" fields? If I wanted to take the results of a query
	    and export that data to MS Excel, could I do that?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Mozilla allows data export through a custom DTD in XML format.
	    It does not, however, export to specific formats other than the
	    XML Mozilla DTD.  Importing the data into Excel or any other application
	    is left as an exercise for the reader.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you create import filters to other applications from Mozilla's XML,
	    please submit your modifications for inclusion in future Bugzilla
	    distributions.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    As for data import, any application can send data to Bugzilla through
	    the HTTP protocol, or through Mozilla's XML API.  However, it seems
	    kind of silly to put another front-end in front of Bugzilla;
	    it makes more sense to create a simplified bug submission form in
	    HTML.  You can find an excellent example at
	    <ulink url="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/help/bugzilla-helper.html">
	    http://www.mozilla.org/quality/help/bugzilla-helper.html</ulink>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Has anyone converted Bugzilla to another language to be used in other
	    countries? Is it localizable?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    To a certain extent, yes. 2.16's templates mean that you can localise
      the user-facing UI (and several projects are doing exactly that.) However,
      error messages and the admin interface are currently not localisable.
      This should be achieved by 2.18.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Can a user create and save reports? Can they do this in Word format?
	    Excel format?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  No.  No.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla have the ability to search by word, phrase, compound
	    search?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    You have no idea.  Bugzilla's query interface, particularly with the
	    advanced Boolean operators, is incredibly versatile.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	     Does Bugzilla provide record locking when there is simultaneous access
	    to the same bug? Does the second person get a notice that the bug is in use
	    or how are they notified?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Bugzilla does not lock records.  It provides mid-air collision detection,
	    and offers the offending user a choice of options to deal with the conflict.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Are there any backup features provided?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    MySQL, the database back-end for Bugzilla, allows hot-backup of data.
	    You can find strategies for dealing with backup considerations
	    at <ulink url="http://www.mysql.com/doc/B/a/Backup.html">
	    http://www.mysql.com/doc/B/a/Backup.html</ulink>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Can users be on the system while a backup is in progress?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  However, commits to the database must wait
	    until the tables are unlocked.  Bugzilla databases are typically
	    very small, and backups routinely take less than a minute.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    What type of human resources are needed to be on staff to install and
	    maintain Bugzilla? Specifically, what type of skills does the person need to
	    have? I need to find out if we were to go with Bugzilla, what types of
	    individuals would we need to hire and how much would that cost vs buying an
	    "Out-of-the-Box" solution.
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    If Bugzilla is set up correctly from the start, continuing maintenance
      needs are minimal and can be done easily using the web interface.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Commercial Bug-tracking software typically costs somewhere upwards
	    of $20,000 or more for 5-10 floating licenses.  Bugzilla consultation
	    is available from skilled members of the newsgroup. Simple questions
      are answered there and then.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    What time frame are we looking at if we decide to hire people to install
	    and maintain the Bugzilla? Is this something that takes hours or weeks to
	    install and a couple of hours per week to maintain and customize or is this
	    a multi-week install process, plus a full time job for 1 person, 2 people,
	    etc?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    It all depends on your level of commitment.  Someone with much Bugzilla
	    experience can get you up and running in less than a day, and
	    your Bugzilla install can run untended for years.  If your
	    Bugzilla strategy is critical to your business workflow, hire somebody
	    with reasonable UNIX or Perl skills to handle your process management and
	    bug-tracking maintenance &amp; customization.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Is there any licensing fee or other fees for using Bugzilla? Any
	    out-of-pocket cost other than the bodies needed as identified above?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    No.  MySQL asks, if you find their product valuable, that you purchase
	    a support contract from them that suits your needs.

	<question>
	  <para>
	    Are there any security problems with Bugzilla?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    The Bugzilla code has undergone a reasonably complete security audit,
      and user-facing CGIs run under Perl's taint mode. However, 
	    it is recommended that you closely examine permissions on your Bugzilla
	    installation, and follow the recommended security guidelines found
	    in The Bugzilla Guide.

	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>

	      http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=6679</ulink>. This

	    I don't like/want to use Procmail to hand mail off to bug_email.pl.
	    What alternatives do I have?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    You can call bug_email.pl directly from your aliases file, with
	    an entry like this:
	    <blockquote>
	      <para>
		bugzilla-daemon: "|/usr/local/bin/bugzilla/contrib/bug_email.pl"
	      </para>
	    </blockquote>
	    However, this is fairly nasty and subject to problems; you also
	    need to set up your smrsh (sendmail restricted shell) to allow
	    it.  In a pinch, though, it can work.

	  <para>
	    Double-check that you have not turned off email in your user preferences.
	    Confirm that Bugzilla is able to send email by visiting the "Log In"

	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you never receive mail from Bugzilla, chances you do not have

	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Run the <quote>sanity check</quote> utility

	    OK (i.e. any red letters), there are certain things

	    it can't auto-recover, I hope you're familiar with
	    mysqladmin commands or have installed another way to
	    manage your database.  Sanity Check, although it is a good
	    basic check on your database integrity, by no means is a
	    substitute for competent database administration and
	    avoiding deletion of data.  It is not exhaustive, and was
	    created to do a basic check for the most common problems

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	     There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also generally
	    not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what you're doing.
	    However, if you understand SQL you can use the mysqladmin utility to
	    manually insert, delete, and modify table information. Personally, I
	    use "phpMyAdmin". You have to compile a PHP module with MySQL
	    support to make it work, but it's very clean and easy to use.

	  <para>
	    Certain version of MySQL (notably, 3.23.29 and 3.23.30) accidentally disabled

	  <para>
	    Try running MySQL from its binary: "mysqld --skip-grant-tables". This

	    How do I synchronize bug information among multiple different Bugzilla

	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.  Synchronization will
	    only work one way -- you can create a read-only copy of the database
	    at one site, and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main
	    database.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    MySQL has some synchronization features builtin to the latest releases.
	    It would be great if someone looked into the possibilities there
	    and provided a report to the newsgroup on how to effectively
	    synchronize two Bugzilla installations.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you simply need to transfer bugs from one Bugzilla to another,
	    checkout the "move.pl" script in the Bugzilla distribution.

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure
	    the Web server to treat *.cgi files as CGI scripts. In IIS, you do this by
	    adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with the &lt;path&gt;\perl.exe %s %s as the
	    executable.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Microsoft has some advice on this matter, as well:
	    <blockquote>
	      <para>
		"Set application mappings. In the ISM, map the extension for the script
		file(s) to the executable for the script interpreter. For example, you might
		map the extension .py to Python.exe, the executable for the Python script
		interpreter. Note For the ActiveState Perl script interpreter, the extension
		.pl is associated with PerlIS.dll by default. If you want to change the
		association of .pl to perl.exe, you need to change the application mapping.
		In the mapping, you must add two percent (%) characters to the end of the
		pathname for perl.exe, as shown in this example: c:\perl\bin\perl.exe %s %s"
