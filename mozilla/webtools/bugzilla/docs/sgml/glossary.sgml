	<glossdef>
	  <para>
	    Apache web server, and other NCSA-compliant web servers,
	    observe the convention of using files in directories
	    called <filename>.htaccess</filename> files.  These
	    restrict parameters of the web server.  In Bugzilla, they
	    are used to restrict access to certain files which would
	    otherwise compromise your installation.  For instance, the
	    <filename>localconfig</filename> file contains the
	    password to your database.  If this information were
	    generally available, and remote access to your database
	    turned on, you risk corruption of your database by
	    computer criminals or the curious.

	<glossdef>
	<para>
	    A <quote>Bug</quote> in Bugzilla refers to an issue
	    entered into the database which has an associated number,
	    assignments, comments, etc. Some also refer to a
	    <quote>tickets</quote> or <quote>issues</quote>; in the
	    context of Bugzilla, they are synonymous.

	<glossterm>Bug Number</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>
	    Each Bugzilla Bug is assigned a number that uniquely
	    identifies that Bug.  The Bug associated with a Bug Number
	    can be pulled up via a query, or easily from the very
	    front page by typing the number in the "Find" box.

	  <para>A Bug has stages through which it must pass before
	    becoming a <quote>closed bug</quote>, including
	    acceptance, resolution, and verification.  The <quote>Bug
	      Life Cycle</quote> is moderately flexible according to
	    the needs of the organization using it, though.</para>

	<glossterm id="gloss_product">Product</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>A Product is a broad category of types of bugs.  In
	    general, there are several Components to a Product.  A
	    Product also defines a default Group (used for Bug
	    Security) for all bugs entered into components beneath
	    it.</para>
	  <example>
	    <title>A Sample Product</title>
	    <para>A company sells a software product called
	      <quote>X</quote>.  They also maintain some older
	      software called <quote>Y</quote>, and have a secret
	      project <quote>Z</quote>.  An effective use of Products
	      might be to create Products <quote>X</quote>,
	      <quote>Y</quote>, <quote>Z</quote>, each with Components
	      of User Interface, Database, and Business Logic.  They
	      might also change group permissions so that only those
	      people who are members of Group <quote>Z</quote> can see
	      components and bugs under Product
	      <quote>Z</quote>.</para>

	<glossterm>QA</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para><quote>QA</quote>, <quote>Q/A</quote>, and
	    <quote>Q.A.</quote> are short for <quote>Quality
	      Assurance</quote>.  In most large software development
	    organizations, there is a team devoted to ensuring the
	    product meets minimum standards before shipping.  This
	    team will also generally want to track the progress of
	    bugs over their life cycle, thus the need for the
	    <quote>QA Contact</quote> field in a Bug.</para>

	<glossterm id="gloss_recursion">Recursion</glossterm>
	<glossdef>
	  <para>The property of a function looking back at itself for
	    something.  <quote>GNU</quote>, for instance, stands for
	    <quote>GNU's Not UNIX</quote>, thus recursing upon itself
	    for definition.  For further clarity, see Infinite

	<glossdef>
	  <para>This is the cryptic response sent by Bugzilla when a
	    query returned no results.  It is just a goofy way of
	    saying "Zero Bugs Found".</para>
