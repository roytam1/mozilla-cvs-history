What's New?
***********

Generic Reporting
-----------------

Bugzilla has a new mechanism for generating reports of the current state of
the bug database.  It has two related parts: a table-based view, and several
graphical views.

The table-based view allows you to specify an x, y and z (multiple tables of
data) axis to plot, and then restrict the bugs plotted using the standard
query form.  You can view the resulting data as an HTML or CSV export (e.g.:
for importing into a spreadsheet).

There are also bar, line and pie charts, which are defined in a very similar
way.  These views may be more appropriate for particular data types, and are
suitable for saving and then putting into presentations or web pages.


Request System
---------------

The Request System (RS) is a set of enhancements that adds powerful flag
(superset of the old attachment status) features to the bugs.

RS allows for four states: off, granted, denied, and (optionally) requested,
where "granted" is the equivalent of "on". These additions mean it is no
longer necessary to define a status to negate another status (e.g.
"needs-work" to negate "has-review") because negation is built into each
status via the status' "denied" state.  Bug statuses: Previously only
attachments could have these kinds of statuses. RS enables them for bugs as
well. This feature can be used to request and grant/deny certain properties
for a bug, such as inclusion for a specific milestone or approval for checkin.
This way, Bugzilla supports the natural decision-making process in your
organization.

- Requests: Flags can now optionally be made requestable, which means users
  can ask other users to set them. When a user requests a flag, Bugzilla
  emails the requestee and adds the request to a browsable queue so both the
  requester and the requestee can keep track of its status. Once the
  requestee fulfills the request by setting the flag to either granted or
  denied, Bugzilla emails the requestee and removes the request from the
  queue.  This feature supports workflow like the mozilla.org code review
  and milestone approval processes, whereby code is peer reviewed before
  being committed and patches get approved by product release managers for
  inclusion in specific product releases.

- Product/component specificity: Previously flags were product-specific, and
  if you wanted the same flag for multiple products you had to define
  multiple flags with the same name. Flags are now
  product/component-specific, and a single flag can be enabled or disabled
  for multiple product/component combinations via inclusions and exclusions
  lists. Flags are enabled for all combinations on their inclusions list
  except those that appear on their exclusions list.


Enterprise Group Support
------------------------

Bugzilla is no longer limited to 55 access control groups. Administrators can
define an arbitrary number of access groups composed of individual users or
other groups.  The groups can be configured via the web interface to achieve a
wide variety of access control policies. See the documentation section on
'Groups And Group Controls' for details.


User Wildcard Matching
----------------------

Sites can now enable the use of wildcards and substrings in bug entry and
editing forms. If the user enters an incomplete username, he'll get a list of
users that matched the given username.


Support for "Insiders"
----------------------

If the 'insidergroup' parameter is defined, a specific group of users can be
designated insiders who can designate comments and attachments as private to
other insiders. These comments and attachments will be invisible to other
users who are not members of the insiders group even if the bugs to which they
apply are visible. Other insiders will see the comments and attachments with a
visual tinting indicating that they are private.


Time Tracking
-------------

Controls for tracking time spent fixing bugs are included in the bug form for
members of the group specified by the 'timetrackinggroup' parameter. Any time
comments are added to the bug, members of the time tracking group can add an
amount of time they spent, and it's figured into the total and displayed at
the top of the bug. Shown in the bug are your original estimate, the amount of
time spent so far, the revised estimate of how much time is remaining, and
your gain/loss on the original estimate.


Authentication module/LDAP improvements
---------------------------------------

Bugzilla's authentication mechanisms have been modularized, making pluggable
authentication schemes for Bugzilla a reality. Both the existing database and
LDAP systems were ported as part of modularization process. Additionally, the
CGI portion of the backend was redesigned to allow for authentication from
other sources, including (theoretically) email, which will help Bug 94850.

As part of this conversion, LDAP logins now use Perl's standard Net::LDAP
module, which has no external library dependencies.


Improved localization support
-----------------------------

Bugzilla administrators can now configure which languages are supported by
their installations and automatically serve correct, localized content to
users based on the HTTP 'Accept-Language' header sent from users' browsers.

There are currently localized templates available for: Arabic, Belarusian,
Chinese, French, German, Italian, Korean, Portuguese (Brazil) Spanish (Spain
or Mexico) and Russian.  These localized template packs are third-party
contributions, may only be available for specific versions, and may not be
supported in the future. (http://www.bugzilla.org/download/#localizations)


Patch Viewer
------------

Viewing and reviewing patches in Bugzilla is often difficult due to lack of
context, improper format and the inherent readability issues that raw patches
present. Patch Viewer is an enhancement to Bugzilla designed to fix that by
offering increased context, linking to sections, and integrating with Bonsai,
LXR and CVS.


Comment Reply Links
-------------------

In Edit Bug, each bug comment now includes a convenient (reply) link that
quotes the comment text into the textarea. This feature is only enabled in
Javascript-capable browsers, but causes no inconvenience to other user agents.


Full-Text Search
----------------

It is now possible to query the Bugzilla database using full-text searching,
which spans comments and summaries, and which searches for substrings and stem
variations of the search term. Basically, it's like using Google.


Email Address Munging
---------------------

The fact that raw email addresses are displayed in Bugzilla makes it trivial
for bots that spamharvest to spider through Bugzilla, in particular, through
Bugzilla's buglists. This change adds HTML obfuscation of email addresses as
they appear in the Bugzilla web pages.


Generic Charting
----------------

Bugzilla's new charting feature allows you to display flexible summary charts,
based on configurable data sets (bug 16009).


Miscellaneous Improvements
--------------------------

- The "Assigned To" field on the new bug page is now prefilled with the default
  component owner.

- A bug alias column is now available in the buglist page.

- Lists of bugs containing errors in the sanity check page now have a "view as
  buglist" link in addition to the individual bug links.

- Autolinkification Page - It's now possible to apply Bugzilla's comment
  hyperlinking algorithm to any text you like. This should be useful for status
  updates and other web pages which give lists of bugs. The bug links created
  include the subject, status and resolution of the bug as a tooltip.

- There are more <link> tags on the links toolbar for navigating quickly between
  different areas.

- Buglists are now available as comma-separated value files (CSV) and JavaScript
  (JS) as well as HTML and RDF.

- Keywords and dependencies can now be entered during initial bug entry.

- A CSS id signature unique to each Bugzilla installation is now added to the
  <body> tag on Bugzilla pages to allow custom end-user CSS to explicitly affect
  Bugzilla.

- Perl's path has been changed to a normal /usr/bin/perl from the original
  legacy "bonsaitools" path specifier.

- A new "always-require-login" parameter allows administrators to require a
  login before being able to view any page, except the front page.

- A developer may add an attachment, and also reassign a bug to himself as part
  of that single action.

- Bugzilla is now able to use the replication facilities provided by the
  MySQL database to handle updates from the main database to the secondaries.

- Mail handling is now between 125% to 175% faster.


Code Changes Which May Affect Customizations
********************************************

- A mechanism (called "Template Hooks") for third party extensions to plug into
  existing templates without having to patch or replace distributed templates
  has been added. More information on this can be found in the documentation.

- Header output now uses CGI.pm, in a step towards enabling mod_perl
  compatibility. This change will affect users that had customized charsets in
  their CGI files: previously the charset had to be added everywhere that
  printed the Content-Type header; now it only needs changing in one spot, in
  Bugzilla/CGI.pm.

- $::FORM{} and $::COOKIE{} are deprecated. Use the $cgi methods to access
  them.

- $::userid is gone in favor of Bugzilla->user->id

- ConnectToDatabase() is gone (it's done automatically when you initialize the
  Bugzilla object)

- quietly_check_login() and confirm_login() are gone, use Bugzilla->login()
  with parameters for whether the login is required or not.

- Use Bugzilla->user->login in place of $::COOKIE{Bugzilla_login}

- You can tell if there's a user logged in or not by checking if
  Bugzilla->user exists rather than looking for $::userid==0


Recommended Practice for the Upgrade
************************************

As always, please ensure you have run checksetup.pl after replacing the
files in your installation.

It is recommended that you view the sanity check page (sanitycheck.cgi) both
before the upgrade and after running checksetup.pl after the upgrade, to see
if there are any problems with your installation.

It is also recommended that, if possible, you fix any problems you find
immediately. Failure to do this may mean that Bugzilla will not work correctly.
Be aware that if the sanity check page contains more errors after an upgrade,
it doesn't necessarily mean there are more errors in your database, as
additional tests are added to the sanity check over time, and it is possible
that those errors weren't being checked for in the old version.

As previously noted in the Dependency Requirements MySQL is now required to be
at least version 3.23.41.  This implies that all tables of type ISAM will be
converted by the checksetup.pl script to MyISAM.  As with any upgrade it is
recommended to make a backup of the database, perhaps by using mysqldump.

Example:

  mysqldump -u root -p --databases bugs > bugs.db.backup
