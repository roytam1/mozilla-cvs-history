><P
>Bugzilla is configured by changing various parameters, accessed
    from the "Edit parameters" link in the page footer. Here are
    some of the key parameters on that page. You should run down this
    list and set them appropriately after installing Bugzilla.</P
><DIV
CLASS="procedure"
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
> 
        <B
CLASS="command"
>maintainer</B
>:
        The maintainer parameter is the email address of the person 
        responsible for maintaining this
        Bugzilla installation. The address need not be that of a valid Bugzilla
        account.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>urlbase</B
>:
        This parameter defines the fully qualified domain name and web 
        server path to your Bugzilla installation.</P
><P
>For example, if your Bugzilla query page is
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/query.cgi</TT
>, 
        set your <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"urlbase"</SPAN
>
        to <TT
CLASS="filename"
>http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/</TT
>.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>usebuggroups</B
>:
        This dictates whether or not to implement group-based security for
        Bugzilla. If set, Bugzilla bugs can have an associated 'group',
        defining which users are allowed to see and edit the
        bug.</P
><P
>Set "usebuggroups" to "on" 
        <EM
>only</EM
>
        if you may wish to restrict access to particular bugs to certain
        groups of users. I suggest leaving
        this parameter <EM
>off</EM
>
        while initially testing your Bugzilla.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>usebuggroupsentry</B
>:
        Bugzilla Products can have a group associated with them, so that
        certain users can only see bugs in certain products. When this parameter
        is set to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"on"</SPAN
>, this places all newly-created bugs in the
        group for their product immediately.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>shadowdb</B
>:
        You run into an interesting problem when Bugzilla reaches a
        high level of continuous activity. MySQL supports only table-level
        write locking. What this means is that if someone needs to make a
        change to a bug, they will lock the entire table until the operation
        is complete. Locking for write also blocks reads until the write is
        complete. Note that more recent versions of mysql support row level
        locking using different table types. These types are slower than the
        standard type, and Bugzilla does not yet take advantage of features
        such as transactions which would justify this speed decrease. The
        Bugzilla team are, however, happy to hear about any experiences with
        row level locking and Bugzilla</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shadowdb"</SPAN
>
        parameter was designed to get around this limitation. While only a
        single user is allowed to write to a table at a time, reads can
        continue unimpeded on a read-only shadow copy of the database.
        Although your database size will double, a shadow database can cause
        an enormous performance improvement when implemented on extremely
        high-traffic Bugzilla databases.</P
><P
>&#13;        As a guide, mozilla.org began needing 
        <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shadowdb"</SPAN
>
        when they reached around 40,000 Bugzilla users with several hundred
        Bugzilla bug changes and comments per day.</P
><P
>The value of the parameter defines the name of the 
        shadow bug database. You will need to set the host and port settings
        from the params page, and set up replication in your database server
        so that updates reach this readonly mirror. Consult your database
        documentation for more detail.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>shutdownhtml</B
>:

        If you need to shut down Bugzilla to perform administration, enter
        some descriptive HTML here and anyone who tries to use Bugzilla will
        receive a page to that effect. Obviously, editparams.cgi will
        still be accessible so you can remove the HTML and re-enable Bugzilla.
        :-)

><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>passwordmail</B
>:

        Every time a user creates an account, the text of
        this parameter (with substitutions) is sent to the new user along with
        their password message.</P
><P
>Add any text you wish to the "passwordmail" parameter box. For
        instance, many people choose to use this box to give a quick training
        blurb about how to use Bugzilla at your site.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;	<B
CLASS="command"
>movebugs</B
>:

	This option is an undocumented feature to allow moving bugs
	between separate Bugzilla installations.  You will need to understand
	the source code in order to use this feature.  Please consult
	<TT
CLASS="filename"
>movebugs.pl</TT
> in your Bugzilla source tree for
	further documentation, such as it is.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>useqacontact</B
>:

        This allows you to define an email address for each component, in
        addition
        to that of the default owner, who will be sent carbon copies of
        incoming bugs.</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>usestatuswhiteboard</B
>:
        This defines whether you wish to have a free-form, overwritable field
        associated with each bug. The advantage of the Status Whiteboard is
        that it can be deleted or modified with ease, and provides an
        easily-searchable field for indexing some bugs that have some trait
        in common.         
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>whinedays</B
>:
        Set this to the number of days you want to let bugs go
        in the NEW or REOPENED state before notifying people they have
        untouched new bugs. If you do not plan to use this feature, simply do
        not set up the whining cron job described in the installation
        instructions, or set this value to "0" (never whine).</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>commenton*</B
>:
        All these
        fields allow you to dictate what changes can pass without comment,
        and which must have a comment from the person who changed them.
        Often, administrators will allow users to add themselves to the CC
        list, accept bugs, or change the Status Whiteboard without adding a
        comment as to their reasons for the change, yet require that most
        other changes come with an explanation.</P
><P
>Set the "commenton" options according to your site policy. It
        is a wise idea to require comments when users resolve, reassign, or
        reopen bugs at the very least.

>It is generally far better to require a developer comment
          when resolving bugs than not. Few things are more annoying to bug
          database users than having a developer mark a bug "fixed" without
          any comment as to what the fix was (or even that it was truly
          fixed!)</P

>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>supportwatchers</B
>:

        Turning on this option allows users to ask to receive copies of 
        all a particular other user's bug email. This is, of
        course, subject to the groupset restrictions on the bug; if the 
        <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"watcher"</SPAN
>
        would not normally be allowed to view a bug, the watcher cannot get
        around the system by setting herself up to watch the bugs of someone
        with bugs outside her privileges. They would still only receive email
        updates for those bugs she could normally view.</P
