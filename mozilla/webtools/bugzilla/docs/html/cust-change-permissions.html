>&#13;        This feature should be considered experimental; the Bugzilla code you
        will be changing is not stable, and could change or move between 
        versions. Be aware that if you make modifications to it, you may have
        to re-make them or port them if Bugzilla changes internally between
        versions.

>&#13;      Companies often have rules about which employees, or classes of employees,
      are allowed to change certain things in the bug system. For example, 
      only the bug's designated QA Contact may be allowed to VERIFY the bug.
      Bugzilla has been
      designed to make it easy for you to write your own custom rules to define
      who is allowed to make what sorts of value transition.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      For maximum flexibility, customizing this means editing Bugzilla's Perl 
      code. This gives the administrator complete control over exactly who is
      allowed to do what. The relevant function is called 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>CheckCanChangeField()</TT
>,
      and is found in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>process_bug.cgi</TT
> in your 
      Bugzilla directory. If you open that file and grep for 
      "sub CheckCanChangeField", you'll find it.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      This function has been carefully commented to allow you to see exactly
      how it works, and give you an idea of how to make changes to it. Certain
      marked sections should not be changed - these are the "plumbing" which
      makes the rest of the function work. In between those sections, you'll
      find snippets of code like:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>    # Allow the owner to change anything.
    if ($ownerid eq $whoid) {
        return 1;
    }</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      It's fairly obvious what this piece of code does.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      So, how does one go about changing this function? Well, simple changes
      can be made just be removing pieces - for example, if you wanted to 
      prevent any user adding a comment to a bug, just remove the lines marked
      "Allow anyone to change comments." And if you want the reporter to have
      no special rights on bugs they have filed, just remove the entire section
      which refers to him.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      More complex customizations are not much harder. Basically, you add
      a check in the right place in the function, i.e. after all the variables
      you are using have been set up. So, don't look at $ownerid before 
      $ownerid has been obtained from the database. You can either add a
      positive check, which returns 1 (allow) if certain conditions are true,
      or a negative check, which returns 0 (deny.) E.g.:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>    if ($field eq "qacontact") {
        if (UserInGroup("quality_assurance")) {
            return 1;
        } 
        else {
            return 0;
        }
    }</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      This says that only users in the group "quality_assurance" can change
      the QA Contact field of a bug. Getting more weird:
      <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>    if (($field eq "priority") &#38;&#38;
        ($vars-&#62;{'user'}{'login'} =~ /.*\@example\.com$/))
    {
        if ($oldvalue eq "P1") {
            return 1;
        } 
        else {
            return 0;
        }
    }</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
      This says that if the user is trying to change the priority field,
      and their email address is @example.com, they can only do so if the
      old value of the field was "P1". Not very useful, but illustrative.

>&#13;      For a list of possible field names, look in 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>data/versioncache</TT
> for the list called 
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>@::log_columns</TT
>. If you need help writing custom
      rules for your organization, ask in the newsgroup.
