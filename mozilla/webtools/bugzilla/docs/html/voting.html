NAME="voting">5.4. Voting</H1
><P
>The concept of "voting" is a poorly understood, yet powerful
    feature for the management of open-source projects. Each user is
    assigned so many Votes per product, which they can freely reassign (or
    assign multiple votes to a single bug). This allows developers to gauge
    user need for a particular enhancement or bugfix. By allowing bugs with
    a certain number of votes to automatically move from "UNCONFIRMED" to
    "NEW", users of the bug system can help high-priority bugs garner
    attention so they don't sit for a long time awaiting triage.</P
><P
>The daunting challenge of Votes is deciding where you draw the
    line for a "vocal majority". If you only have a user base of 100 users,
    setting a low threshold for bugs to move from UNCONFIRMED to NEW makes
    sense. As the Bugzilla user base expands, however, these thresholds
    must be re-evaluated. You should gauge whether this feature is worth
    the time and close monitoring involved, and perhaps forego
    implementation until you have a critical mass of users who demand
    it.</P

>Set "Maximum Votes a person can put on a single bug" to your
        calculated value. It should probably be some number lower than the
        "Maximum votes per person". Setting this field to "0" disables
        voting, but leaves the voting options open to the user. This is
        confusing.</P

>Set "Number of votes a bug in this product needs to
        automatically get out of the UNCONFIRMED state" to your calculated
        number. Setting this field to "0" disables the automatic move of
        bugs from UNCONFIRMED to NEW. Some people advocate leaving this at
        "0", but of what use are Votes if your Bugzilla user base is unable
        to affect which bugs appear on Development radar?
