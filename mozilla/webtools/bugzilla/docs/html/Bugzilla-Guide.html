    effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying
    it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License
    preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their
    work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</P
><P
>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
    designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
    can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether
    it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally
    for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P

NAME="gfdl-1">1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</H3
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
    the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such
    manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
    as "you".</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
    with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this License.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
    public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
    by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
    "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
    designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
    proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
    processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
    generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
    which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
    near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
    beginning of the body of the text.</P

><P
>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
    the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies
    you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P
><P
>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above,
    and you may publicly display copies.</P

NAME="gfdl-3">3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</H3
><P
>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
    100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
    enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
    Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
    on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
    as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full
    title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may
    add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document
    and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably)
    on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
    Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
    Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
    complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which
    the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
    option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
    Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
    at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
    (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
    public.</P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
    the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
    Document.</P

    under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
    the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
    Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and
    modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it.
    In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</P

        permission.</P

        was based on. These may be placed in the "History" section. You may
        omit a network location for a work that was published at least four
        years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the
        version it refers to gives permission.</P

    appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
    copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of
    these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of
    Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. These titles
    must be distinct from any other section titles.</P

>You may add a section entitled "Endorsements", provided it contains
    nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties--for
    example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by
    an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard.</P

    and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the
    list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of
    Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through
    arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a
    cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement
    made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add
    another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the
    previous publisher that added the old one.</P

NAME="whatis">2.1. What is Bugzilla?</H1
><P
>&#13;    Bugzilla is a bug- or issue-tracking system. Bug-tracking
    systems allow individual or groups of developers effectively to keep track
    of outstanding problems with their product. 
    Bugzilla was originally
    written by Terry Weissman in a programming language called TCL, to
    replace a rudimentary bug-tracking database used internally by Netscape
    Communications. Terry later ported Bugzilla to Perl from TCL, and in Perl
    it remains to this day. Most commercial defect-tracking software vendors
    at the time charged enormous licensing fees, and Bugzilla quickly became
    a favorite of the open-source crowd (with its genesis in the open-source
    browser project, Mozilla). It is now the de-facto standard
    defect-tracking system against which all others are measured.

NAME="why">2.2. Why Should We Use Bugzilla?</H1
><P
>For many years, defect-tracking software has remained principally
    the domain of large software development houses. Even then, most shops
    never bothered with bug-tracking software, and instead simply relied on
    shared lists and email to monitor the status of defects. This procedure
    is error-prone and tends to cause those bugs judged least significant by
    developers to be dropped or ignored.</P
><P
>These days, many companies are finding that integrated
    defect-tracking systems reduce downtime, increase productivity, and raise
    customer satisfaction with their systems. Along with full disclosure, an
    open bug-tracker allows manufacturers to keep in touch with their clients
    and resellers, to communicate about problems effectively throughout the
    data management chain. Many corporations have also discovered that
    defect-tracking helps reduce costs by providing IT support
    accountability, telephone support knowledge bases, and a common,
    well-understood system for accounting for unusual system or software
    issues.</P
><P
>But why should 
    <EM
>you</EM
>

    use Bugzilla?</P
><P
>Bugzilla is very adaptable to various situations. Known uses
    currently include IT support queues, Systems Administration deployment
    management, chip design and development problem tracking (both
    pre-and-post fabrication), and software and hardware bug tracking for
    luminaries such as Redhat, NASA, Linux-Mandrake, and VA Systems.
    Combined with systems such as

>Bonsai</A
>, or 
    <A
HREF="http://www.perforce.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Perforce SCM</A
>, Bugzilla
    provides a powerful, easy-to-use solution to configuration management and
    replication problems.</P
><P
>Bugzilla can dramatically increase the productivity and
    accountability of individual employees by providing a documented workflow
    and positive feedback for good performance. How many times do you wake up
    in the morning, remembering that you were supposed to do 
    <EM
>something</EM
>
    today, but you just can't quite remember? Put it in Bugzilla, and you
    have a record of it from which you can extrapolate milestones, predict
    product versions for integration, and  follow the discussion trail 
    that led to critical decisions.</P
><P
>Ultimately, Bugzilla puts the power in your hands to improve your
    value to your employer or business while providing a usable framework for
    your natural attention to detail and knowledge store to flourish.</P

      However, Bugzilla will automatically make hyperlinks out of certain

      http://www.bugzilla.org will be turned into
      <A

      Otherwise, you may spam people unnecessarily with bug mail.
      To take an example: a user can set up their account to filter out messages
      where someone just adds themselves to the CC field of a bug
      (which happens a lot.) If you come along, add yourself to the CC field,
      and add a comment saying "Adding self to CC", then that person
      gets a pointless piece of mail they would otherwise have avoided.

>&#13;      The existing authentication
      scheme for Bugzilla uses email addresses as the primary user ID, and a
      password to authenticate that user. All places within Bugzilla where
      you need to deal with user ID (e.g assigning a bug) use the email
      address. The LDAP authentication builds on top of this scheme, rather
      than replacing it. The initial log in is done with a username and
      password for the LDAP directory. This then fetches the email address
      from LDAP and authenticates seamlessly in the standard Bugzilla
      authentication scheme using this email address. If an account for this
      address already exists in your Bugzilla system, it will log in to that
      account. If no account for that email address exists, one is created at
      the time of login. (In this case, Bugzilla will attempt to use the
      "displayName" or "cn" attribute to determine the user's full name.)
      After authentication, all other user-related tasks are still handled by
      email address, not LDAP username. You still assign bugs by email
      address, query on users by email address, etc.

      you will not be able to log back in to Bugzilla once you log out. (If
      this happens, you can get back in by manually editing the data/params
      file, and setting useLDAP back to 0.)
      </P
><P
>If using LDAP, you must set the
      three additional parameters: Set LDAPserver to the name (and optionally
      port) of your LDAP server. If no port is specified, it defaults to the
      default port of 389. (e.g "ldap.mycompany.com" or
      "ldap.mycompany.com:1234") Set LDAPBaseDN to the base DN for searching
      for users in your LDAP directory. (e.g. "ou=People,o=MyCompany") uids
      must be unique under the DN specified here. Set LDAPmailattribute to
      the name of the attribute in your LDAP directory which contains the
      primary email address. On most directory servers available, this is
      "mail", but you may need to change this.

      Executing the following code snippet from a UNIX command shell will
      rectify the problem if your Bugzilla installation is intended for an
      English-speaking audience. As always, be sure your Bugzilla
      installation has a good backup before making changes, and I recommend
      you understand what the script is doing before executing it.</P

>There are a lot of common libraries and utilities out there that
    Apple did not include with Mac OS X, but which run perfectly well on it.
    The GD library, which Bugzilla needs to do bug graphs, is one of
    these.</P
><P
>The easiest way to get a lot of these is with a program called
    Fink, which is similar in nature to the CPAN installer, but installs
    common GNU utilities. Fink is available from
    &#60;http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/&#62;.</P
><P
>Follow the instructions for setting up Fink. Once it's installed,
    you'll want to run the following as root: 
    <B
CLASS="command"
>fink install gd</B
>
    </P
><P
>It will prompt you for a number of dependencies, type 'y' and hit
    enter to install all of the dependencies. Then watch it work.</P
><P
>To prevent creating conflicts with the software that Apple installs
    by default, Fink creates its own directory tree at /sw where it installs
    most of the software that it installs. This means your libraries and
    headers for libgd will be at /sw/lib and /sw/include instead of /usr/lib
    and /usr/local/include. Because of these changed locations for the
    libraries, the Perl GD module will not install directly via CPAN, because it
    looks for the specific paths instead of getting them from your
    environment. But there's a way around that :-)</P

    This should go through the motions of downloading the latest version of

      modules up to date was to haul down the Perl distribution itself and
      build it. Needless to say, this has caused headaches for just about
      everybody. Upgrading to a newer version of CPAN with the

        You run into an interesting problem when Bugzilla reaches a
        high level of continuous activity. MySQL supports only table-level
        write locking. What this means is that if someone needs to make a
        change to a bug, they will lock the entire table until the operation
        is complete. Locking for write also blocks reads until the write is
        complete. The 
        <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shadowdb"</SPAN
>
        parameter was designed to get around this limitation. While only a
        single user is allowed to write to a table at a time, reads can
        continue unimpeded on a read-only shadow copy of the database.
        Although your database size will double, a shadow database can cause
        an enormous performance improvement when implemented on extremely
        high-traffic Bugzilla databases.</P

>&#13;        As a guide, mozilla.org began needing

NAME="AEN1539">5.7.1. What to Edit</H2
><P
>&#13;        There are two different ways of editing of Bugzilla's templates,
        and which you use depends mainly on how you upgrade Bugzilla. The
        template directory structure is that there's a top level directory,
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template</TT
>, which contains a directory for
        each installed localisation. The default English templates are
        therefore in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>en</TT
>. Underneath that, there
        is the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default</TT
> directory and optionally the 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom</TT
> directory. The <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default</TT
>
        directory contains all the templates shipped with Bugzilla, whereas
        the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom</TT
> directory does not exist at first and
        must be created if you want to use it.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The first method of making customisations is to directly edit the
        templates in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/default</TT
>. This is
        probably the best method for small changes if you are going to use
        the CVS method of upgrading, because if you then execute a
        <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs update</B
>, any template fixes will get
        automagically merged into your modified versions.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        If you use this method, your installation will break if CVS conflicts
        occur.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The other method is to copy the templates into a mirrored directory
        structure under <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/custom</TT
>.  The templates
        in this directory automatically override those in default.  
        This is the technique you
        need to use if you use the overwriting method of upgrade, because
        otherwise your changes will be lost.  This method is also better if
        you are using the CVS method of upgrading and are going to make major
        changes, because it is guaranteed that the contents of this directory
        will not be touched during an upgrade, and you can then decide whether
        to continue using your own templates, or make the effort to merge your
        changes into the new versions by hand.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        If you use this method, your installation may break if incompatible
        changes are made to the template interface.  If such changes are made
        they will be documented in the release notes, provided you are using a
        stable release of Bugzilla.  If you use using unstable code, you will
        need to deal with this one yourself, although if possible the changes
        will be mentioned before they occur in the deprecations section of the
        previous stable release's release notes.

NAME="AEN1558">5.7.2. How To Edit Templates</H2
><P
>&#13;        The syntax of the Template Toolkit language is beyond the scope of
        this guide. It's reasonably easy to pick up by looking at the current 
        templates; or, you can read the manual, available on the
        <A
HREF="http://www.template-toolkit.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Template Toolkit home
        page</A
>. However, you should particularly remember (for security
        reasons) to always HTML filter things which come from the database or
        user input, to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        However, one thing you should take particular care about is the need
        to properly HTML filter data that has been passed into the template.
        This means that if the data can possibly contain special HTML characters
        such as &#60;, and the data was not intended to be HTML, they need to be
        converted to entity form, ie &#38;lt;.  You use the 'html' filter in the
        Template Toolkit to do this.  If you fail to do this, you may open up
        your installation to cross-site scripting attacks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Also note that Bugzilla adds a few filters of its own, that are not
        in standard Template Toolkit.  In particular, the 'url_quote' filter
        can convert characters that are illegal or have special meaning in URLs,
        such as &#38;, to the encoded form, ie %26.  This actually encodes most
        characters (but not the common ones such as letters and numbers and so
        on), including the HTML-special characters, so there's never a need to
        HTML filter afterwards.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Editing templates is a good way of doing a "poor man's custom fields".
        For example, if you don't use the Status Whiteboard, but want to have
        a free-form text entry box for "Build Identifier", then you can just
        edit the templates to change the field labels. It's still be called
        status_whiteboard internally, but your users don't need to know that.

><P
>&#13;        Some CGIs have the ability to use more than one template. For
        example, buglist.cgi can output bug lists as RDF or two
        different forms of HTML (complex and simple). (Try this out
        by appending <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#38;format=simple</TT
> to a buglist.cgi
        URL on your Bugzilla installation.) This
        mechanism, called template 'formats', is extensible.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To see if a CGI supports multiple output formats, grep the
        CGI for "ValidateOutputFormat". If it's not present, adding
        multiple format support isn't too hard - see how it's done in
        other CGIs.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To make a new format template for a CGI which supports this, 
        open a current template for
        that CGI and take note of the INTERFACE comment (if present.) This 
        comment defines what variables are passed into this template. If 
        there isn't one, I'm afraid you'll have to read the template and
        the code to find out what information you get.

>&#13;        Write your template in whatever markup or text style is appropriate.
      </P

>&#13;        You now need to decide what content type you want your template

        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>$contenttypes</TT

        variable. If your content type is not there, add it. Remember
        the three- or four-letter tag assigned to you content type. 
        This tag will be part of the template filename.

        You may wish to get bug submitters to give certain bits of structured

        extensible fashion to enable you to define arbitrary fields and widgets,

        Put it in the <TT

        collected - such as a build number, or set of steps to reproduce.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Then, create a template like 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom/bug/create/comment.txt.tmpl</TT
>, also named
        after your format if you are using one, which
        references the form fields you have created. When a bug report is

><P
>A plain Bugzilla is fairly easy to upgrade from one version to a
    newer one. Always read the release notes to see if there are any issues
    that you might need to take note of. It is recommended that you take a 
    backup of your database and your entire Bugzilla installation before attempting an
    upgrade. You can upgrade a 'clean' installation by untarring a new
    tarball over the old installation. If you are upgrading from 2.12 or
    later, and have cvs installed, you can type <TT
CLASS="filename"
>cvs -z3 update</TT
>, 
    and resolve conflicts if there are any.
    </P
><P
>However, things get a bit more complicated if you've made
    changes to Bugzilla's code. In this case, you may have to re-make or
    reapply those changes. One good method is to take a diff of your customised
    version against the original, so you can survey all that you've changed.
    Hopefully, templatisation will reduce the need for
    this in the future.</P
><P
>From version 2.8 onwards, Bugzilla databases can be automatically
    carried forward during an upgrade. However, because the developers of
    Bugzilla are constantly adding new
    tables, columns and fields, you'll probably get SQL errors if you just
    update the code and attempt to use Bugzilla. Always run the
    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>checksetup.pl</TT
> 
    script whenever you upgrade your installation.</P
><P
>If you are running Bugzilla version 2.8 or lower, and wish to
    upgrade to the latest version, please consult the file,

	    We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
	    other defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please
      get in touch. However, from the author's personal
	    experience with other bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers
	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
	    (free!), more developer- friendly features (such as stored
	    queries, email integration, and platform independence),
	    improved scalability, open source code, greater
	    flexibility, and superior ease-of-use.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    If you happen to be a commercial bug-tracker vendor, please
	    step forward with a list of advantages your product has over
      Bugzilla. We'd be happy to include it in the "Competitors"

	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it.  Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in

	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source
	    bug-tracking software in existence.

	    Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had outsiders

	    Mozilla allows data export through a custom DTD in XML format.
	    It does not, however, export to specific formats other than the

	    is left as an exercise for the reader.

	    To a certain extent, yes. 2.16's templates mean that you can localise

	    Double-check that you have not turned off email in your user preferences.
	    Confirm that Bugzilla is able to send email by visiting the "Log In"
	    link of your Bugzilla installation and clicking the "Email me a password"
	    button after entering your email address.

	    Red Hat Bugzilla works with Oracle.  The current version

	     There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also generally
	    not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what you're doing.
	    However, if you understand SQL you can use the mysqladmin utility to
	    manually insert, delete, and modify table information. Personally, I
	    use "phpMyAdmin". You have to compile a PHP module with MySQL
	    support to make it work, but it's very clean and easy to use.

	    Try running MySQL from its binary: "mysqld --skip-grant-tables". This

	    Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.  Synchronization will

	    at one site, and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main
	    database.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    MySQL has some synchronization features builtin to the latest releases.
	    It would be great if someone looked into the possibilities there

	  </P

	    Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure

    how Bugzilla organizes database because of nitpicky requests from users
    for tiny changes in wording, rather than having people re-educate
    themselves or figure out how to work our procedures around the tool. It
    sucks, but it can and will happen to you, so learn how the schema works
    and deal with it when it comes.</P
><P
>So, here you are with your brand-new installation of Bugzilla.
    You've got MySQL set up, Apache working right, Perl DBI and DBD talking
    to the database flawlessly. Maybe you've even entered a few test bugs to
    make sure email's working; people seem to be notified of new bugs and
    changes, and you can enter and edit bugs to your heart's content. Perhaps
    you've gone through the trouble of setting up a gateway for people to
    submit bugs to your database via email, have had a few people test it,
    and received rave reviews from your beta testers.</P

>What's the next thing you do? Outline a training strategy for your
    development team, of course, and bring them up to speed on the new tool
    you've labored over for hours.</P

    captive audience which seems enraptured by the efficiency embodied in
    this thing called "Bugzilla". You are caught up describing the nifty
    features, how people can save favorite queries in the database, set them
    up as headers and footers on their pages, customize their layouts,
    generate reports, track status with greater efficiency than ever before,
    leap tall buildings with a single bound and rescue Jane from the clutches
    of Certain Death!</P
><P
>But Certain Death speaks up -- a tiny voice, from the dark corners
    of the conference room. "I have a concern," the voice hisses from the
    darkness, "about the use of the word 'verified'.</P
><P
>The room, previously filled with happy chatter, lapses into
    reverential silence as Certain Death (better known as the Vice President
    of Software Engineering) continues. "You see, for two years we've used
    the word 'verified' to indicate that a developer or quality assurance
    engineer has confirmed that, in fact, a bug is valid. I don't want to
    lose two years of training to a new software product. You need to change
    the bug status of 'verified' to 'approved' as soon as possible. To avoid
    confusion, of course."</P
><P
>Oh no! Terror strikes your heart, as you find yourself mumbling
    "yes, yes, I don't think that would be a problem," You review the changes
    with Certain Death, and continue to jabber on, "no, it's not too big a
    change. I mean, we have the source code, right? You know, 'Use the
    Source, Luke' and all that... no problem," All the while you quiver
    inside like a beached jellyfish bubbling, burbling, and boiling on a hot
    Jamaican sand dune...</P

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's&nbsp;an&nbsp;overview&nbsp;of&nbsp;what&nbsp;each&nbsp;table&nbsp;does.&nbsp;&nbsp;Most&nbsp;columns&nbsp;in&nbsp;each&nbsp;table&nbsp;have<br>
descriptive&nbsp;names&nbsp;that&nbsp;make&nbsp;it&nbsp;fairly&nbsp;trivial&nbsp;to&nbsp;figure&nbsp;out&nbsp;their&nbsp;jobs.<br>
<br>
attachments:&nbsp;This&nbsp;table&nbsp;stores&nbsp;all&nbsp;attachments&nbsp;to&nbsp;bugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;tends&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;your<br>
largest&nbsp;table,&nbsp;yet&nbsp;also&nbsp;generally&nbsp;has&nbsp;the&nbsp;fewest&nbsp;entries&nbsp;because&nbsp;file<br>
attachments&nbsp;are&nbsp;so&nbsp;(relatively)&nbsp;large.<br>
<br>
bugs:&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;core&nbsp;of&nbsp;your&nbsp;system.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;table&nbsp;stores&nbsp;most&nbsp;of&nbsp;the<br>
current&nbsp;information&nbsp;about&nbsp;a&nbsp;bug,&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;exception&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;info&nbsp;stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;the<br>
other&nbsp;tables.<br>
<br>
bugs_activity:&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;stores&nbsp;information&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;what&nbsp;changes&nbsp;are&nbsp;made&nbsp;to&nbsp;bugs<br>
when&nbsp;--&nbsp;a&nbsp;history&nbsp;file.<br>
<br>
cc:&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;tiny&nbsp;table&nbsp;simply&nbsp;stores&nbsp;all&nbsp;the&nbsp;CC&nbsp;information&nbsp;for&nbsp;any&nbsp;bug&nbsp;which&nbsp;has<br>
any&nbsp;entries&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;CC&nbsp;field&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;bug.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that,&nbsp;like&nbsp;most&nbsp;other&nbsp;tables&nbsp;in<br>
Bugzilla,&nbsp;it&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;refer&nbsp;to&nbsp;users&nbsp;by&nbsp;their&nbsp;user&nbsp;names,&nbsp;but&nbsp;by&nbsp;their&nbsp;unique<br>
userid,&nbsp;stored&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;primary&nbsp;key&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;profiles&nbsp;table.<br>
<br>
components:&nbsp;This&nbsp;stores&nbsp;the&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and&nbsp;components&nbsp;(or&nbsp;products&nbsp;and<br>
components,&nbsp;in&nbsp;newer&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;parlance)&nbsp;for&nbsp;Bugzilla.&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously,&nbsp;the&nbsp;"program"<br>
(product)&nbsp;field&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;full&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;product,&nbsp;rather&nbsp;than&nbsp;some&nbsp;other&nbsp;unique<br>
identifier,&nbsp;like&nbsp;bug_id&nbsp;and&nbsp;user_id&nbsp;are&nbsp;elsewhere&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;database.<br>
<br>
dependencies:&nbsp;Stores&nbsp;data&nbsp;about&nbsp;those&nbsp;cool&nbsp;dependency&nbsp;trees.<br>
<br>
fielddefs:&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;nifty&nbsp;table&nbsp;that&nbsp;defines&nbsp;other&nbsp;tables.&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;instance,&nbsp;when&nbsp;you<br>
submit&nbsp;a&nbsp;form&nbsp;that&nbsp;changes&nbsp;the&nbsp;value&nbsp;of&nbsp;"AssignedTo"&nbsp;this&nbsp;table&nbsp;allows<br>
translation&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;actual&nbsp;field&nbsp;name&nbsp;"assigned_to"&nbsp;for&nbsp;entry&nbsp;into&nbsp;MySQL.<br>
<br>
groups:&nbsp;&nbsp;defines&nbsp;bitmasks&nbsp;for&nbsp;groups.&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;number&nbsp;that&nbsp;can&nbsp;uniquely<br>
identify&nbsp;group&nbsp;memberships.&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;instance,&nbsp;say&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to<br>
tweak&nbsp;parameters&nbsp;is&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;a&nbsp;value&nbsp;of&nbsp;"1",&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;edit<br>
users&nbsp;is&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;a&nbsp;"2",&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;create&nbsp;new&nbsp;groups&nbsp;is<br>
assigned&nbsp;the&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;of&nbsp;"4".&nbsp;&nbsp;By&nbsp;uniquely&nbsp;combining&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;bitmasks&nbsp;(much<br>
like&nbsp;the&nbsp;chmod&nbsp;command&nbsp;in&nbsp;UNIX,)&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;identify&nbsp;a&nbsp;user&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;tweak<br>
parameters&nbsp;and&nbsp;create&nbsp;groups,&nbsp;but&nbsp;not&nbsp;edit&nbsp;users,&nbsp;by&nbsp;giving&nbsp;him&nbsp;a&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;of<br>
"5",&nbsp;or&nbsp;a&nbsp;user&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;edit&nbsp;users&nbsp;and&nbsp;create&nbsp;groups,&nbsp;but&nbsp;not&nbsp;tweak<br>
parameters,&nbsp;by&nbsp;giving&nbsp;him&nbsp;a&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;of&nbsp;"6"&nbsp;Simple,&nbsp;huh?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;this&nbsp;makes&nbsp;no&nbsp;sense&nbsp;to&nbsp;you,&nbsp;try&nbsp;this&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;mysql&nbsp;prompt:<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;groups;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll&nbsp;see&nbsp;the&nbsp;list,&nbsp;it&nbsp;makes&nbsp;much&nbsp;more&nbsp;sense&nbsp;that&nbsp;way.<br>
<br>
keyworddefs:&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions&nbsp;of&nbsp;keywords&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used<br>
<br>
keywords:&nbsp;Unlike&nbsp;what&nbsp;you'd&nbsp;think,&nbsp;this&nbsp;table&nbsp;holds&nbsp;which&nbsp;keywords&nbsp;are<br>
associated&nbsp;with&nbsp;which&nbsp;bug&nbsp;id's.<br>
<br>
logincookies:&nbsp;This&nbsp;stores&nbsp;every&nbsp;login&nbsp;cookie&nbsp;ever&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;to&nbsp;you&nbsp;for&nbsp;every<br>
machine&nbsp;you've&nbsp;ever&nbsp;logged&nbsp;into&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;from.&nbsp;&nbsp;Curiously,&nbsp;it&nbsp;never&nbsp;does&nbsp;any<br>
housecleaning&nbsp;--&nbsp;I&nbsp;see&nbsp;cookies&nbsp;in&nbsp;this&nbsp;file&nbsp;I've&nbsp;not&nbsp;used&nbsp;for&nbsp;months.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,<br>
since&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;never&nbsp;expires&nbsp;your&nbsp;cookie&nbsp;(for&nbsp;convenience'&nbsp;sake),&nbsp;it&nbsp;makes<br>
sense.<br>
<br>
longdescs:&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;meat&nbsp;of&nbsp;bugzilla&nbsp;--&nbsp;here&nbsp;is&nbsp;where&nbsp;all&nbsp;user&nbsp;comments&nbsp;are&nbsp;stored!<br>
You've&nbsp;only&nbsp;got&nbsp;2^24&nbsp;bytes&nbsp;per&nbsp;comment&nbsp;(it's&nbsp;a&nbsp;mediumtext&nbsp;field),&nbsp;so&nbsp;speak<br>
sparingly&nbsp;--&nbsp;that's&nbsp;only&nbsp;the&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of&nbsp;space&nbsp;the&nbsp;Old&nbsp;Testament&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Bible<br>
would&nbsp;take&nbsp;(uncompressed,&nbsp;16&nbsp;megabytes).&nbsp;&nbsp;Each&nbsp;comment&nbsp;is&nbsp;keyed&nbsp;to&nbsp;the<br>
bug_id&nbsp;to&nbsp;which&nbsp;it's&nbsp;attached,&nbsp;so&nbsp;the&nbsp;order&nbsp;is&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;chronological,&nbsp;for<br>
comments&nbsp;are&nbsp;played&nbsp;back&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;order&nbsp;in&nbsp;which&nbsp;they&nbsp;are&nbsp;received.<br>
<br>
milestones:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting&nbsp;that&nbsp;milestones&nbsp;are&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific&nbsp;product<br>
in&nbsp;this&nbsp;table,&nbsp;but&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;yet&nbsp;support&nbsp;differing&nbsp;milestones&nbsp;by<br>
product&nbsp;through&nbsp;the&nbsp;standard&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;interfaces.<br>
<br>
namedqueries:&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;where&nbsp;everybody&nbsp;stores&nbsp;their&nbsp;"custom&nbsp;queries".&nbsp;&nbsp;Very<br>
cool&nbsp;feature;&nbsp;it&nbsp;beats&nbsp;the&nbsp;tar&nbsp;out&nbsp;of&nbsp;having&nbsp;to&nbsp;bookmark&nbsp;each&nbsp;cool&nbsp;query&nbsp;you<br>
construct.<br>
<br>
products:&nbsp;&nbsp;What&nbsp;products&nbsp;you&nbsp;have,&nbsp;whether&nbsp;new&nbsp;bug&nbsp;entries&nbsp;are&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;for&nbsp;the<br>
product,&nbsp;what&nbsp;milestone&nbsp;you're&nbsp;working&nbsp;toward&nbsp;on&nbsp;that&nbsp;product,&nbsp;votes,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;It<br>
will&nbsp;be&nbsp;nice&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;components&nbsp;table&nbsp;supports&nbsp;these&nbsp;same&nbsp;features,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you<br>
could&nbsp;close&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;component&nbsp;for&nbsp;bug&nbsp;entry&nbsp;without&nbsp;having&nbsp;to&nbsp;close&nbsp;an<br>
entire&nbsp;product...<br>
<br>
profiles:&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you&nbsp;were&nbsp;wondering&nbsp;where&nbsp;your&nbsp;precious&nbsp;user&nbsp;information&nbsp;was<br>
stored?&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&nbsp;it&nbsp;is!&nbsp;&nbsp;With&nbsp;the&nbsp;passwords&nbsp;in&nbsp;plain&nbsp;text&nbsp;for&nbsp;all&nbsp;to&nbsp;see!&nbsp;(but<br>
sshh...&nbsp;don't&nbsp;tell&nbsp;your&nbsp;users!)<br>
<br>
profiles_activity:&nbsp;&nbsp;Need&nbsp;to&nbsp;know&nbsp;who&nbsp;did&nbsp;what&nbsp;when&nbsp;to&nbsp;who's&nbsp;profile?&nbsp;&nbsp;This'll<br>
tell&nbsp;you,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;complete&nbsp;history.<br>
<br>
shadowlog:&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;could&nbsp;be&nbsp;mistaken&nbsp;here,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;this&nbsp;table&nbsp;tells&nbsp;you&nbsp;when<br>
your&nbsp;shadow&nbsp;database&nbsp;is&nbsp;updated&nbsp;and&nbsp;what&nbsp;commands&nbsp;were&nbsp;used&nbsp;to&nbsp;update&nbsp;it.&nbsp;&nbsp;We<br>
don't&nbsp;use&nbsp;a&nbsp;shadow&nbsp;database&nbsp;at&nbsp;our&nbsp;site&nbsp;yet,&nbsp;so&nbsp;it's&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;empty&nbsp;for&nbsp;us.<br>
<br>
versions:&nbsp;&nbsp;Version&nbsp;information&nbsp;for&nbsp;every&nbsp;product<br>
<br>
votes:&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&nbsp;voted&nbsp;for&nbsp;what&nbsp;when<br>
<br>
watch:&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&nbsp;(according&nbsp;to&nbsp;userid)&nbsp;is&nbsp;watching&nbsp;who's&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;(according&nbsp;to&nbsp;their<br>
userid).<br>
<br>
<br>
===<br>
THE&nbsp;DETAILS<br>
===<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you're&nbsp;wondering&nbsp;just&nbsp;what&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;information&nbsp;above?&nbsp;&nbsp;At&nbsp;the<br>
mysql&nbsp;prompt,&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;view&nbsp;any&nbsp;information&nbsp;about&nbsp;the&nbsp;columns&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;table&nbsp;with<br>
this&nbsp;command&nbsp;(where&nbsp;"table"&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;table&nbsp;you&nbsp;wish&nbsp;to&nbsp;view):<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;show&nbsp;columns&nbsp;from&nbsp;table;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;can&nbsp;also&nbsp;view&nbsp;all&nbsp;the&nbsp;data&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;table&nbsp;with&nbsp;this&nbsp;command:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;table;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;note:&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very&nbsp;bad&nbsp;idea&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;on,&nbsp;for&nbsp;instance,&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"&nbsp;table&nbsp;if<br>
you&nbsp;have&nbsp;50,000&nbsp;bugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll&nbsp;be&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;there&nbsp;a&nbsp;while&nbsp;until&nbsp;you&nbsp;ctrl-c&nbsp;or<br>
50,000&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;play&nbsp;across&nbsp;your&nbsp;screen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;can&nbsp;limit&nbsp;the&nbsp;display&nbsp;from&nbsp;above&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;command,&nbsp;where<br>
"column"&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;column&nbsp;for&nbsp;which&nbsp;you&nbsp;wish&nbsp;to&nbsp;restrict&nbsp;information:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;table&nbsp;where&nbsp;(column&nbsp;=&nbsp;"some&nbsp;info");<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;or&nbsp;the&nbsp;reverse&nbsp;of&nbsp;this<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;table&nbsp;where&nbsp;(column&nbsp;!=&nbsp;"some&nbsp;info");<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's&nbsp;take&nbsp;our&nbsp;example&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;introduction,&nbsp;and&nbsp;assume&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;change<br>
the&nbsp;word&nbsp;"verified"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"approved"&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;field.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;know&nbsp;from&nbsp;the<br>
above&nbsp;information&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;is&nbsp;likely&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"<br>
table.&nbsp;Note&nbsp;we'll&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;change&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;perl&nbsp;code&nbsp;as&nbsp;well&nbsp;as&nbsp;this&nbsp;database<br>
change,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I&nbsp;won't&nbsp;plunge&nbsp;into&nbsp;that&nbsp;in&nbsp;this&nbsp;document.&nbsp;Let's&nbsp;verify&nbsp;the<br>
information&nbsp;is&nbsp;stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"&nbsp;table:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;show&nbsp;columns&nbsp;from&nbsp;bugs<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(exceedingly&nbsp;long&nbsp;output&nbsp;truncated&nbsp;here)<br>
|&nbsp;bug_status|&nbsp;enum('UNCONFIRMED','NEW','ASSIGNED','REOPENED','RESOLVED','VERIFIED','CLOSED')||MUL&nbsp;|&nbsp;UNCONFIRMED||<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry&nbsp;about&nbsp;that&nbsp;long&nbsp;line.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;see&nbsp;from&nbsp;this&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bug&nbsp;status"&nbsp;column&nbsp;is<br>
an&nbsp;"enum&nbsp;field",&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;peculiarity&nbsp;where&nbsp;a&nbsp;string&nbsp;type&nbsp;field&nbsp;can<br>
only&nbsp;have&nbsp;certain&nbsp;types&nbsp;of&nbsp;entries.&nbsp;&nbsp;While&nbsp;I&nbsp;think&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;very&nbsp;cool,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;not<br>
standard&nbsp;SQL.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway,&nbsp;we&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;possible&nbsp;enum&nbsp;field&nbsp;entry<br>
'APPROVED'&nbsp;by&nbsp;altering&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"&nbsp;table.<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;ALTER&nbsp;table&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;CHANGE&nbsp;bug_status&nbsp;bug_status<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;enum("UNCONFIRMED",&nbsp;"NEW",&nbsp;"ASSIGNED",&nbsp;"REOPENED",&nbsp;"RESOLVED",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;"VERIFIED",&nbsp;"APPROVED",&nbsp;"CLOSED")&nbsp;not&nbsp;null;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(note&nbsp;we&nbsp;can&nbsp;take&nbsp;three&nbsp;lines&nbsp;or&nbsp;more&nbsp;--&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;you&nbsp;put&nbsp;in&nbsp;before&nbsp;the<br>
semicolon&nbsp;is&nbsp;evaluated&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single&nbsp;expression)<br>
<br>
Now&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;do&nbsp;this:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;show&nbsp;columns&nbsp;from&nbsp;bugs;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;see&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;bug_status&nbsp;field&nbsp;has&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra&nbsp;"APPROVED"&nbsp;enum&nbsp;that's<br>
available!&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;thing,&nbsp;too,&nbsp;is&nbsp;that&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;reflected&nbsp;on&nbsp;your&nbsp;query&nbsp;page&nbsp;as<br>
well&nbsp;--&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;query&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;status.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;how's&nbsp;it&nbsp;fit&nbsp;into&nbsp;the&nbsp;existing<br>
scheme&nbsp;of&nbsp;things?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks&nbsp;like&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back&nbsp;and&nbsp;look&nbsp;for&nbsp;instances&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;word&nbsp;"verified"<br>
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;perl&nbsp;code&nbsp;for&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;--&nbsp;wherever&nbsp;you&nbsp;find&nbsp;"verified",&nbsp;change&nbsp;it&nbsp;to<br>
"approved"&nbsp;and&nbsp;you're&nbsp;in&nbsp;business&nbsp;(make&nbsp;sure&nbsp;that's&nbsp;a&nbsp;case-insensitive&nbsp;search).<br>
Although&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;query&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;enum&nbsp;field,&nbsp;you&nbsp;can't&nbsp;give&nbsp;something&nbsp;a&nbsp;status<br>
of&nbsp;"APPROVED"&nbsp;until&nbsp;you&nbsp;make&nbsp;the&nbsp;perl&nbsp;changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;this&nbsp;change&nbsp;I<br>
mentioned&nbsp;can&nbsp;also&nbsp;be&nbsp;done&nbsp;by&nbsp;editing&nbsp;checksetup.pl,&nbsp;which&nbsp;automates&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of<br>
this.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;know&nbsp;this&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;anyway,&nbsp;right?<br>

    is a shell script which submits a Bugzilla query and writes
    the resulting HTML page to stdout. It supports both short options, (such
    as "-Afoo" or "-Rbar") and long options (such as "--assignedto=foo" or
    "--reporter=bar"). If the first character of an option is not "-", it is
    treated as if it were prefixed with "--default=".</P

>The column list is taken from the COLUMNLIST environment variable.
    This is equivalent to the "Change Columns" option when you list bugs in
    buglist.cgi. If you have already used Bugzilla, grep for COLUMNLIST
    in your cookies file to see your current COLUMNLIST setting.</P

    "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=" turns the bug list into
    a working link if any bugs are found. Counting bugs is easy. Pipe the
