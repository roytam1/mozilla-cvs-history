      this software. Carefully consider the implications of installing
      other network services with Bugzilla. The Bugzilla development
      team members, Netscape Communications, America Online Inc., and
      any affiliated developers or sponsors assume no liability for

NAME="whatis">2.1. What is Bugzilla?</H1
><P
>&#13;    Bugzilla is a bug- or issue-tracking system. Bug-tracking
    systems allow individual or groups of developers effectively to keep track
    of outstanding problems with their product. 
    Bugzilla was originally
    written by Terry Weissman in a programming language called TCL, to
    replace a rudimentary bug-tracking database used internally by Netscape
    Communications. Terry later ported Bugzilla to Perl from TCL, and in Perl
    it remains to this day. Most commercial defect-tracking software vendors
    at the time charged enormous licensing fees, and Bugzilla quickly became
    a favorite of the open-source crowd (with its genesis in the open-source
    browser project, Mozilla). It is now the de-facto standard
    defect-tracking system against which all others are measured.

NAME="why">2.2. Why Should We Use Bugzilla?</H1
><P
>For many years, defect-tracking software has remained principally
    the domain of large software development houses. Even then, most shops
    never bothered with bug-tracking software, and instead simply relied on
    shared lists and email to monitor the status of defects. This procedure
    is error-prone and tends to cause those bugs judged least significant by
    developers to be dropped or ignored.</P
><P
>These days, many companies are finding that integrated
    defect-tracking systems reduce downtime, increase productivity, and raise
    customer satisfaction with their systems. Along with full disclosure, an
    open bug-tracker allows manufacturers to keep in touch with their clients
    and resellers, to communicate about problems effectively throughout the
    data management chain. Many corporations have also discovered that
    defect-tracking helps reduce costs by providing IT support
    accountability, telephone support knowledge bases, and a common,
    well-understood system for accounting for unusual system or software
    issues.</P
><P
>But why should 
    <EM
>you</EM
>

    use Bugzilla?</P
><P
>Bugzilla is very adaptable to various situations. Known uses
    currently include IT support queues, Systems Administration deployment
    management, chip design and development problem tracking (both
    pre-and-post fabrication), and software and hardware bug tracking for
    luminaries such as Redhat, NASA, Linux-Mandrake, and VA Systems.
    Combined with systems such as

>Bonsai</A
>, or 
    <A
HREF="http://www.perforce.com"
TARGET="_top"
>Perforce SCM</A
>, Bugzilla
    provides a powerful, easy-to-use solution to configuration management and
    replication problems.</P
><P
>Bugzilla can dramatically increase the productivity and
    accountability of individual employees by providing a documented workflow
    and positive feedback for good performance. How many times do you wake up
    in the morning, remembering that you were supposed to do 
    <EM
>something</EM
>
    today, but you just can't quite remember? Put it in Bugzilla, and you
    have a record of it from which you can extrapolate milestones, predict
    product versions for integration, and  follow the discussion trail 
    that led to critical decisions.</P
><P
>Ultimately, Bugzilla puts the power in your hands to improve your
    value to your employer or business while providing a usable framework for
    your natural attention to detail and knowledge store to flourish.</P

>&#13;      The existing authentication
      scheme for Bugzilla uses email addresses as the primary user ID, and a
      password to authenticate that user. All places within Bugzilla where
      you need to deal with user ID (e.g assigning a bug) use the email
      address. The LDAP authentication builds on top of this scheme, rather
      than replacing it. The initial log in is done with a username and
      password for the LDAP directory. This then fetches the email address
      from LDAP and authenticates seamlessly in the standard Bugzilla
      authentication scheme using this email address. If an account for this
      address already exists in your Bugzilla system, it will log in to that
      account. If no account for that email address exists, one is created at
      the time of login. (In this case, Bugzilla will attempt to use the

        Bugzilla products can have a group associated with them, so that
        certain users can only see bugs in certain products. When this 
        parameter is set to <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

        causes the initial group controls on newly created products 
        to place all newly-created bugs in the group 
        having the same name as the product immediately.
        After a product is initially created, the group controls
        can be further adjusted without interference by 
        this mechanism.</P

>shadowdb</B

        You run into an interesting problem when Bugzilla reaches a
        high level of continuous activity. MySQL supports only table-level
        write locking. What this means is that if someone needs to make a
        change to a bug, they will lock the entire table until the operation
        is complete. Locking for write also blocks reads until the write is
        complete. Note that more recent versions of mysql support row level
        locking using different table types. These types are slower than the
        standard type, and Bugzilla does not yet take advantage of features
        such as transactions which would justify this speed decrease. The
        Bugzilla team are, however, happy to hear about any experiences with
        row level locking and Bugzilla</P
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shadowdb"</SPAN
>
        parameter was designed to get around this limitation. While only a
        single user is allowed to write to a table at a time, reads can
        continue unimpeded on a read-only shadow copy of the database.
        Although your database size will double, a shadow database can cause
        an enormous performance improvement when implemented on extremely
        high-traffic Bugzilla databases.</P
><P
>&#13;        As a guide, mozilla.org began needing 
        <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shadowdb"</SPAN
>
        when they reached around 40,000 Bugzilla users with several hundred
        Bugzilla bug changes and comments per day.</P
><P
>The value of the parameter defines the name of the 
        shadow bug database. You will need to set the host and port settings
        from the params page, and set up replication in your database server
        so that updates reach this readonly mirror. Consult your database
        documentation for more detail.</P

        If you need to shut down Bugzilla to perform administration, enter
        some descriptive HTML here and anyone who tries to use Bugzilla will
        receive a page to that effect. Obviously, editparams.cgi will
        still be accessible so you can remove the HTML and re-enable Bugzilla.

        Often, administrators will allow users to add themselves to the CC
        list, accept bugs, or change the Status Whiteboard without adding a
        comment as to their reasons for the change, yet require that most
        other changes come with an explanation.</P

      component, an "API" component, a "Sound System" component, and a

      often makes sense to divide Components in Bugzilla according to the

      that component. The QA Contact should be the person who will ensure
      these bugs are completely fixed. The Owner, QA Contact, and Reporter
      will get email when new bugs are created in this Component and when
      these bugs change. Default Owner and Default QA Contact fields only
      dictate the

NAME="AEN1604">5.7.1. What to Edit</H2
><P
>&#13;        There are two different ways of editing of Bugzilla's templates,
        and which you use depends mainly on how you upgrade Bugzilla. The
        template directory structure is that there's a top level directory,
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template</TT
>, which contains a directory for
        each installed localization. The default English templates are
        therefore in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>en</TT
>. Underneath that, there
        is the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default</TT
> directory and optionally the 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom</TT
> directory. The <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default</TT
>
        directory contains all the templates shipped with Bugzilla, whereas
        the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom</TT
> directory does not exist at first and
        must be created if you want to use it.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The first method of making customizations is to directly edit the
        templates in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/default</TT
>. This is
        probably the best method for small changes if you are going to use
        the CVS method of upgrading, because if you then execute a
        <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs update</B
>, any template fixes will get
        automagically merged into your modified versions.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        If you use this method, your installation will break if CVS conflicts
        occur.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The other method is to copy the templates into a mirrored directory
        structure under <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/custom</TT
>.  The templates
        in this directory automatically override those in default.  
        This is the technique you
        need to use if you use the overwriting method of upgrade, because
        otherwise your changes will be lost.  This method is also better if
        you are using the CVS method of upgrading and are going to make major
        changes, because it is guaranteed that the contents of this directory
        will not be touched during an upgrade, and you can then decide whether
        to continue using your own templates, or make the effort to merge your
        changes into the new versions by hand.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        If you use this method, your installation may break if incompatible
        changes are made to the template interface.  If such changes are made
        they will be documented in the release notes, provided you are using a
        stable release of Bugzilla.  If you use using unstable code, you will
        need to deal with this one yourself, although if possible the changes
        will be mentioned before they occur in the deprecations section of the
        previous stable release's release notes.

NAME="AEN1627">5.7.2. How To Edit Templates</H2
><P
>&#13;        The syntax of the Template Toolkit language is beyond the scope of
        this guide. It's reasonably easy to pick up by looking at the current 
        templates; or, you can read the manual, available on the
        <A
HREF="http://www.template-toolkit.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Template Toolkit home
        page</A
>. However, you should particularly remember (for security
        reasons) to always HTML filter things which come from the database or
        user input, to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        However, one thing you should take particular care about is the need
        to properly HTML filter data that has been passed into the template.
        This means that if the data can possibly contain special HTML characters
        such as &#60;, and the data was not intended to be HTML, they need to be
        converted to entity form, ie &#38;lt;.  You use the 'html' filter in the
        Template Toolkit to do this.  If you fail to do this, you may open up
        your installation to cross-site scripting attacks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Also note that Bugzilla adds a few filters of its own, that are not
        in standard Template Toolkit.  In particular, the 'url_quote' filter
        can convert characters that are illegal or have special meaning in URLs,
        such as &#38;, to the encoded form, ie %26.  This actually encodes most
        characters (but not the common ones such as letters and numbers and so
        on), including the HTML-special characters, so there's never a need to
        HTML filter afterwards.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Editing templates is a good way of doing a "poor man's custom fields".
        For example, if you don't use the Status Whiteboard, but want to have
        a free-form text entry box for "Build Identifier", then you can just
        edit the templates to change the field labels. It's still be called
        status_whiteboard internally, but your users don't need to know that.

>&#13;        Some CGIs have the ability to use more than one template. For
        example, buglist.cgi can output bug lists as RDF or two
        different forms of HTML (complex and simple). (Try this out
        by appending <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#38;format=simple</TT
> to a buglist.cgi
        URL on your Bugzilla installation.) This
        mechanism, called template 'formats', is extensible.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To see if a CGI supports multiple output formats, grep the
        CGI for "ValidateOutputFormat". If it's not present, adding
        multiple format support isn't too hard - see how it's done in
        other CGIs.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To make a new format template for a CGI which supports this, 
        open a current template for
        that CGI and take note of the INTERFACE comment (if present.) This 
        comment defines what variables are passed into this template. If 
        there isn't one, I'm afraid you'll have to read the template and
        the code to find out what information you get.

        This contains the "banner", the part of the header that appears

        barren, so you'll probably want to customize this to give your
        installation a distinctive look and feel.  It is recommended you

        you work in the aviation industry, or other environment where this
        might be found offensive (yes, we have true stories of this happening)

        You may wish to get bug submitters to give certain bits of structured
        information, each in a separate input widget, for which there is not a

        extensible fashion to enable you to define arbitrary fields and widgets,

        formatted according to the layout of this template.

      Bugzilla has been

      who is allowed to make what sorts of value transition.

><P
>&#13;      For maximum flexibility, customizing this means editing Bugzilla's Perl

>CheckCanChangeField()</TT

      and is found in <TT
CLASS="filename"

>&#13;      This function has been carefully commented to allow you to see exactly
      how it works, and give you an idea of how to make changes to it. Certain
      marked sections should not be changed - these are the "plumbing" which
      makes the rest of the function work. In between those sections, you'll
      find snippets of code like:
      <TABLE

      It's fairly obvious what this piece of code does.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      So, how does one go about changing this function? Well, simple changes
      can be made just be removing pieces - for example, if you wanted to 
      prevent any user adding a comment to a bug, just remove the lines marked
      "Allow anyone to change comments." And if you want the reporter to have
      no special rights on bugs they have filed, just remove the entire section
      which refers to him.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      More complex customizations are not much harder. Basically, you add
      a check in the right place in the function, i.e. after all the variables
      you are using have been set up. So, don't look at $ownerid before 
      $ownerid has been obtained from the database. You can either add a
      positive check, which returns 1 (allow) if certain conditions are true,
      or a negative check, which returns 0 (deny.) E.g.:

      This says that only users in the group "quality_assurance" can change
      the QA Contact field of a bug. Getting more weird:

      This says that if the user is trying to change the priority field,
      and their email address is @example.com, they can only do so if the
      old value of the field was "P1". Not very useful, but illustrative.

    last point release and the current time. These are often proceeded by a
    stabilization period and release candidates, however the use of 
    development versions or release candidates is beyond the scope of this
    document. Point releases can be distinguished by an increase in the
    second number, or minor version. For example, 2.16.2 is a newer point
    release than 2.14.5.

	    We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
	    other defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please
      get in touch. However, from the author's personal
	    experience with other bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers
	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
	    (free!), more developer- friendly features (such as stored
	    queries, email integration, and platform independence),
	    improved scalability, open source code, greater
	    flexibility, and superior ease-of-use.

	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it. Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in

	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source

            MySQL was originally chosen because it is free, easy to install,

            of the more sensible <TT

            such as Crystal Reports using ODBC. If you choose to do this,
            beware that giving direct access to the database does contain some
            security implications. Even if you give read-only access to the
            bugs database it will bypass the secure bugs features of Bugzilla.

            Bugzilla can output buglists as HTML (the default), CSV or RDF.
            The link for CSV can be found at the bottom of the buglist in HTML
            format. This CSV format can easily be imported into MS Excel or
            other spread-sheet applications.
          </P

            <TT

>&#38;ctype=rdf</TT
> to the URL. RDF
            is meant to be machine readable and thus it is assumed that the

            link to this format.

	    Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs. Synchronization will
	    only work one way -- you can create a read-only copy of the database
	    at one site, and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main
	    database.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    MySQL has some synchronization features builtin to the latest releases.
	    It would be great if someone looked into the possibilities there
	    and provided a report to the newsgroup on how to effectively
	    synchronize two Bugzilla installations.
	  </P

	    Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure

        The logic flow currently used is RESOLVED, then VERIFIED, then CLOSED.
        You <EM
>can</EM
> mass-CLOSE bugs from the change several
        bugs at once page. <EM
>but</EM
>, every bug listed on the
        page has to be in VERIFIED state before the control to do it will show
        up on the form. You can also mass-VERIFY, but every bug listed has to be
        RESOLVED in order for the control to show up on the form. The logic
        behind this is that if you pick one of the bugs that's not VERIFIED and
        try to CLOSE it, the bug change will fail miserably (thus killing any
        changes in the list after it while doing the bulk change) so it doesn't
        even give you the choice.

    for tiny changes in wording, rather than having people re-educate
    themselves or figure out how to work our procedures around the tool. It
    sucks, but it can and will happen to you, so learn how the schema works
    and deal with it when it comes.</P
><P

    You've got MySQL set up, Apache working right, Perl DBI and DBD talking
    to the database flawlessly. Maybe you've even entered a few test bugs to
    make sure email's working; people seem to be notified of new bugs and
    changes, and you can enter and edit bugs to your heart's content. Perhaps
    you've gone through the trouble of setting up a gateway for people to
    submit bugs to your database via email, have had a few people test it,
    and received rave reviews from your beta testers.</P

    up as headers and footers on their pages, customize their layouts,
    generate reports, track status with greater efficiency than ever before,
    leap tall buildings with a single bound and rescue Jane from the clutches
    of Certain Death!</P

    of the conference room. "I have a concern," the voice hisses from the

>The room, previously filled with happy chatter, lapses into
    reverential silence as Certain Death (better known as the Vice President
    of Software Engineering) continues. "You see, for two years we've used
    the word 'verified' to indicate that a developer or quality assurance
    engineer has confirmed that, in fact, a bug is valid. I don't want to
    lose two years of training to a new software product. You need to change
    the bug status of 'verified' to 'approved' as soon as possible. To avoid
    confusion, of course."</P
><P
>Oh no! Terror strikes your heart, as you find yourself mumbling
    "yes, yes, I don't think that would be a problem," You review the changes
    with Certain Death, and continue to jabber on, "no, it's not too big a
    change. I mean, we have the source code, right? You know, 'Use the
    Source, Luke' and all that... no problem," All the while you quiver
    inside like a beached jellyfish bubbling, burbling, and boiling on a hot

&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's&nbsp;an&nbsp;overview&nbsp;of&nbsp;what&nbsp;each&nbsp;table&nbsp;does.&nbsp;Most&nbsp;columns&nbsp;in&nbsp;each&nbsp;table&nbsp;have<br>
descriptive&nbsp;names&nbsp;that&nbsp;make&nbsp;it&nbsp;fairly&nbsp;trivial&nbsp;to&nbsp;figure&nbsp;out&nbsp;their&nbsp;jobs.<br>
<br>
attachments:&nbsp;This&nbsp;table&nbsp;stores&nbsp;all&nbsp;attachments&nbsp;to&nbsp;bugs.&nbsp;It&nbsp;tends&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;your<br>
largest&nbsp;table,&nbsp;yet&nbsp;also&nbsp;generally&nbsp;has&nbsp;the&nbsp;fewest&nbsp;entries&nbsp;because&nbsp;file<br>
attachments&nbsp;are&nbsp;so&nbsp;(relatively)&nbsp;large.<br>
<br>
bugs:&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;core&nbsp;of&nbsp;your&nbsp;system.&nbsp;The&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;table&nbsp;stores&nbsp;most&nbsp;of&nbsp;the<br>
current&nbsp;information&nbsp;about&nbsp;a&nbsp;bug,&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;exception&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;info&nbsp;stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;the<br>
other&nbsp;tables.<br>
<br>
bugs_activity:&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;stores&nbsp;information&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;what&nbsp;changes&nbsp;are&nbsp;made&nbsp;to&nbsp;bugs<br>
when&nbsp;--&nbsp;a&nbsp;history&nbsp;file.<br>
<br>
cc:&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;tiny&nbsp;table&nbsp;simply&nbsp;stores&nbsp;all&nbsp;the&nbsp;CC&nbsp;information&nbsp;for&nbsp;any&nbsp;bug&nbsp;which&nbsp;has<br>
any&nbsp;entries&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;CC&nbsp;field&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;bug.&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that,&nbsp;like&nbsp;most&nbsp;other&nbsp;tables&nbsp;in<br>
Bugzilla,&nbsp;it&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;refer&nbsp;to&nbsp;users&nbsp;by&nbsp;their&nbsp;user&nbsp;names,&nbsp;but&nbsp;by&nbsp;their&nbsp;unique<br>
userid,&nbsp;stored&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;primary&nbsp;key&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;profiles&nbsp;table.<br>
<br>
components:&nbsp;This&nbsp;stores&nbsp;the&nbsp;programs&nbsp;and&nbsp;components&nbsp;(or&nbsp;products&nbsp;and<br>
components,&nbsp;in&nbsp;newer&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;parlance)&nbsp;for&nbsp;Bugzilla.&nbsp;Curiously,&nbsp;the&nbsp;"program"<br>
(product)&nbsp;field&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;full&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;product,&nbsp;rather&nbsp;than&nbsp;some&nbsp;other&nbsp;unique<br>
identifier,&nbsp;like&nbsp;bug_id&nbsp;and&nbsp;user_id&nbsp;are&nbsp;elsewhere&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;database.<br>
<br>
dependencies:&nbsp;Stores&nbsp;data&nbsp;about&nbsp;those&nbsp;cool&nbsp;dependency&nbsp;trees.<br>
<br>
fielddefs:&nbsp;&nbsp;A&nbsp;nifty&nbsp;table&nbsp;that&nbsp;defines&nbsp;other&nbsp;tables.&nbsp;For&nbsp;instance,&nbsp;when&nbsp;you<br>
submit&nbsp;a&nbsp;form&nbsp;that&nbsp;changes&nbsp;the&nbsp;value&nbsp;of&nbsp;"AssignedTo"&nbsp;this&nbsp;table&nbsp;allows<br>
translation&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;actual&nbsp;field&nbsp;name&nbsp;"assigned_to"&nbsp;for&nbsp;entry&nbsp;into&nbsp;MySQL.<br>
<br>
groups:&nbsp;&nbsp;defines&nbsp;bitmasks&nbsp;for&nbsp;groups.&nbsp;A&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;number&nbsp;that&nbsp;can&nbsp;uniquely<br>
identify&nbsp;group&nbsp;memberships.&nbsp;For&nbsp;instance,&nbsp;say&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to<br>
tweak&nbsp;parameters&nbsp;is&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;a&nbsp;value&nbsp;of&nbsp;"1",&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;edit<br>
users&nbsp;is&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;a&nbsp;"2",&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;create&nbsp;new&nbsp;groups&nbsp;is<br>
assigned&nbsp;the&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;of&nbsp;"4".&nbsp;By&nbsp;uniquely&nbsp;combining&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;bitmasks&nbsp;(much<br>
like&nbsp;the&nbsp;chmod&nbsp;command&nbsp;in&nbsp;UNIX,)&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;identify&nbsp;a&nbsp;user&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;tweak<br>
parameters&nbsp;and&nbsp;create&nbsp;groups,&nbsp;but&nbsp;not&nbsp;edit&nbsp;users,&nbsp;by&nbsp;giving&nbsp;him&nbsp;a&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;of<br>
"5",&nbsp;or&nbsp;a&nbsp;user&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;edit&nbsp;users&nbsp;and&nbsp;create&nbsp;groups,&nbsp;but&nbsp;not&nbsp;tweak<br>
parameters,&nbsp;by&nbsp;giving&nbsp;him&nbsp;a&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;of&nbsp;"6"&nbsp;Simple,&nbsp;huh?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;this&nbsp;makes&nbsp;no&nbsp;sense&nbsp;to&nbsp;you,&nbsp;try&nbsp;this&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;mysql&nbsp;prompt:<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;groups;<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll&nbsp;see&nbsp;the&nbsp;list,&nbsp;it&nbsp;makes&nbsp;much&nbsp;more&nbsp;sense&nbsp;that&nbsp;way.<br>
<br>
keyworddefs:&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitions&nbsp;of&nbsp;keywords&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;used<br>
<br>
keywords:&nbsp;Unlike&nbsp;what&nbsp;you'd&nbsp;think,&nbsp;this&nbsp;table&nbsp;holds&nbsp;which&nbsp;keywords&nbsp;are<br>
associated&nbsp;with&nbsp;which&nbsp;bug&nbsp;id's.<br>
<br>
logincookies:&nbsp;This&nbsp;stores&nbsp;every&nbsp;login&nbsp;cookie&nbsp;ever&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;to&nbsp;you&nbsp;for&nbsp;every<br>
machine&nbsp;you've&nbsp;ever&nbsp;logged&nbsp;into&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;from.&nbsp;Curiously,&nbsp;it&nbsp;never&nbsp;does&nbsp;any<br>
housecleaning&nbsp;--&nbsp;I&nbsp;see&nbsp;cookies&nbsp;in&nbsp;this&nbsp;file&nbsp;I've&nbsp;not&nbsp;used&nbsp;for&nbsp;months.&nbsp;However,<br>
since&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;never&nbsp;expires&nbsp;your&nbsp;cookie&nbsp;(for&nbsp;convenience'&nbsp;sake),&nbsp;it&nbsp;makes<br>
sense.<br>
<br>
longdescs:&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;meat&nbsp;of&nbsp;bugzilla&nbsp;--&nbsp;here&nbsp;is&nbsp;where&nbsp;all&nbsp;user&nbsp;comments&nbsp;are&nbsp;stored!<br>
You've&nbsp;only&nbsp;got&nbsp;2^24&nbsp;bytes&nbsp;per&nbsp;comment&nbsp;(it's&nbsp;a&nbsp;mediumtext&nbsp;field),&nbsp;so&nbsp;speak<br>
sparingly&nbsp;--&nbsp;that's&nbsp;only&nbsp;the&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of&nbsp;space&nbsp;the&nbsp;Old&nbsp;Testament&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;Bible<br>
would&nbsp;take&nbsp;(uncompressed,&nbsp;16&nbsp;megabytes).&nbsp;Each&nbsp;comment&nbsp;is&nbsp;keyed&nbsp;to&nbsp;the<br>
bug_id&nbsp;to&nbsp;which&nbsp;it's&nbsp;attached,&nbsp;so&nbsp;the&nbsp;order&nbsp;is&nbsp;necessarily&nbsp;chronological,&nbsp;for<br>
comments&nbsp;are&nbsp;played&nbsp;back&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;order&nbsp;in&nbsp;which&nbsp;they&nbsp;are&nbsp;received.<br>
<br>
milestones:&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting&nbsp;that&nbsp;milestones&nbsp;are&nbsp;associated&nbsp;with&nbsp;a&nbsp;specific&nbsp;product<br>
in&nbsp;this&nbsp;table,&nbsp;but&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;does&nbsp;not&nbsp;yet&nbsp;support&nbsp;differing&nbsp;milestones&nbsp;by<br>
product&nbsp;through&nbsp;the&nbsp;standard&nbsp;configuration&nbsp;interfaces.<br>
<br>
namedqueries:&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;where&nbsp;everybody&nbsp;stores&nbsp;their&nbsp;"custom&nbsp;queries".&nbsp;Very<br>
cool&nbsp;feature;&nbsp;it&nbsp;beats&nbsp;the&nbsp;tar&nbsp;out&nbsp;of&nbsp;having&nbsp;to&nbsp;bookmark&nbsp;each&nbsp;cool&nbsp;query&nbsp;you<br>
construct.<br>
<br>
products:&nbsp;&nbsp;What&nbsp;products&nbsp;you&nbsp;have,&nbsp;whether&nbsp;new&nbsp;bug&nbsp;entries&nbsp;are&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;for&nbsp;the<br>
product,&nbsp;what&nbsp;milestone&nbsp;you're&nbsp;working&nbsp;toward&nbsp;on&nbsp;that&nbsp;product,&nbsp;votes,&nbsp;etc.&nbsp;It<br>
will&nbsp;be&nbsp;nice&nbsp;when&nbsp;the&nbsp;components&nbsp;table&nbsp;supports&nbsp;these&nbsp;same&nbsp;features,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you<br>
could&nbsp;close&nbsp;a&nbsp;particular&nbsp;component&nbsp;for&nbsp;bug&nbsp;entry&nbsp;without&nbsp;having&nbsp;to&nbsp;close&nbsp;an<br>
entire&nbsp;product...<br>
<br>
profiles:&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you&nbsp;were&nbsp;wondering&nbsp;where&nbsp;your&nbsp;precious&nbsp;user&nbsp;information&nbsp;was<br>
stored?&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&nbsp;it&nbsp;is!&nbsp;&nbsp;With&nbsp;the&nbsp;passwords&nbsp;in&nbsp;plain&nbsp;text&nbsp;for&nbsp;all&nbsp;to&nbsp;see!&nbsp;(but<br>
sshh...&nbsp;don't&nbsp;tell&nbsp;your&nbsp;users!)<br>
<br>
profiles_activity:&nbsp;&nbsp;Need&nbsp;to&nbsp;know&nbsp;who&nbsp;did&nbsp;what&nbsp;when&nbsp;to&nbsp;who's&nbsp;profile?&nbsp;&nbsp;This'll<br>
tell&nbsp;you,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;a&nbsp;pretty&nbsp;complete&nbsp;history.<br>
<br>
versions:&nbsp;&nbsp;Version&nbsp;information&nbsp;for&nbsp;every&nbsp;product<br>
<br>
votes:&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&nbsp;voted&nbsp;for&nbsp;what&nbsp;when<br>
<br>
watch:&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&nbsp;(according&nbsp;to&nbsp;userid)&nbsp;is&nbsp;watching&nbsp;who's&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;(according&nbsp;to&nbsp;their<br>

===<br>
THE&nbsp;DETAILS<br>
===<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you're&nbsp;wondering&nbsp;just&nbsp;what&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;information&nbsp;above?&nbsp;&nbsp;At&nbsp;the<br>
mysql&nbsp;prompt,&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;view&nbsp;any&nbsp;information&nbsp;about&nbsp;the&nbsp;columns&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;table&nbsp;with<br>
this&nbsp;command&nbsp;(where&nbsp;"table"&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;table&nbsp;you&nbsp;wish&nbsp;to&nbsp;view):<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;show&nbsp;columns&nbsp;from&nbsp;table;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;can&nbsp;also&nbsp;view&nbsp;all&nbsp;the&nbsp;data&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;table&nbsp;with&nbsp;this&nbsp;command:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;table;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;note:&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very&nbsp;bad&nbsp;idea&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;on,&nbsp;for&nbsp;instance,&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"&nbsp;table&nbsp;if<br>
you&nbsp;have&nbsp;50,000&nbsp;bugs.&nbsp;You'll&nbsp;be&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;there&nbsp;a&nbsp;while&nbsp;until&nbsp;you&nbsp;ctrl-c&nbsp;or<br>
50,000&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;play&nbsp;across&nbsp;your&nbsp;screen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;can&nbsp;limit&nbsp;the&nbsp;display&nbsp;from&nbsp;above&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;command,&nbsp;where<br>
"column"&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;column&nbsp;for&nbsp;which&nbsp;you&nbsp;wish&nbsp;to&nbsp;restrict&nbsp;information:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;table&nbsp;where&nbsp;(column&nbsp;=&nbsp;"some&nbsp;info");<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;or&nbsp;the&nbsp;reverse&nbsp;of&nbsp;this<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;table&nbsp;where&nbsp;(column&nbsp;!=&nbsp;"some&nbsp;info");<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's&nbsp;take&nbsp;our&nbsp;example&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;introduction,&nbsp;and&nbsp;assume&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;change<br>
the&nbsp;word&nbsp;"verified"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"approved"&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;field.&nbsp;We&nbsp;know&nbsp;from&nbsp;the<br>
above&nbsp;information&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;is&nbsp;likely&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"<br>
table.&nbsp;Note&nbsp;we'll&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;change&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;perl&nbsp;code&nbsp;as&nbsp;well&nbsp;as&nbsp;this&nbsp;database<br>
change,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I&nbsp;won't&nbsp;plunge&nbsp;into&nbsp;that&nbsp;in&nbsp;this&nbsp;document.&nbsp;Let's&nbsp;verify&nbsp;the<br>
information&nbsp;is&nbsp;stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"&nbsp;table:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;show&nbsp;columns&nbsp;from&nbsp;bugs<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(exceedingly&nbsp;long&nbsp;output&nbsp;truncated&nbsp;here)<br>
|&nbsp;bug_status|&nbsp;enum('UNCONFIRMED','NEW','ASSIGNED','REOPENED','RESOLVED','VERIFIED','CLOSED')||MUL&nbsp;|&nbsp;UNCONFIRMED||<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry&nbsp;about&nbsp;that&nbsp;long&nbsp;line.&nbsp;We&nbsp;see&nbsp;from&nbsp;this&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bug&nbsp;status"&nbsp;column&nbsp;is<br>
an&nbsp;"enum&nbsp;field",&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;peculiarity&nbsp;where&nbsp;a&nbsp;string&nbsp;type&nbsp;field&nbsp;can<br>
only&nbsp;have&nbsp;certain&nbsp;types&nbsp;of&nbsp;entries.&nbsp;While&nbsp;I&nbsp;think&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;very&nbsp;cool,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;not<br>
standard&nbsp;SQL.&nbsp;Anyway,&nbsp;we&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;possible&nbsp;enum&nbsp;field&nbsp;entry<br>
'APPROVED'&nbsp;by&nbsp;altering&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"&nbsp;table.<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;ALTER&nbsp;table&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;CHANGE&nbsp;bug_status&nbsp;bug_status<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;enum("UNCONFIRMED",&nbsp;"NEW",&nbsp;"ASSIGNED",&nbsp;"REOPENED",&nbsp;"RESOLVED",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;"VERIFIED",&nbsp;"APPROVED",&nbsp;"CLOSED")&nbsp;not&nbsp;null;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(note&nbsp;we&nbsp;can&nbsp;take&nbsp;three&nbsp;lines&nbsp;or&nbsp;more&nbsp;--&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;you&nbsp;put&nbsp;in&nbsp;before&nbsp;the<br>
semicolon&nbsp;is&nbsp;evaluated&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single&nbsp;expression)<br>
<br>
Now&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;do&nbsp;this:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;show&nbsp;columns&nbsp;from&nbsp;bugs;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;see&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;bug_status&nbsp;field&nbsp;has&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra&nbsp;"APPROVED"&nbsp;enum&nbsp;that's<br>
available!&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;thing,&nbsp;too,&nbsp;is&nbsp;that&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;reflected&nbsp;on&nbsp;your&nbsp;query&nbsp;page&nbsp;as<br>
well&nbsp;--&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;query&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;status.&nbsp;But&nbsp;how's&nbsp;it&nbsp;fit&nbsp;into&nbsp;the&nbsp;existing<br>
scheme&nbsp;of&nbsp;things?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks&nbsp;like&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back&nbsp;and&nbsp;look&nbsp;for&nbsp;instances&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;word&nbsp;"verified"<br>
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;perl&nbsp;code&nbsp;for&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;--&nbsp;wherever&nbsp;you&nbsp;find&nbsp;"verified",&nbsp;change&nbsp;it&nbsp;to<br>
"approved"&nbsp;and&nbsp;you're&nbsp;in&nbsp;business&nbsp;(make&nbsp;sure&nbsp;that's&nbsp;a&nbsp;case-insensitive&nbsp;search).<br>
Although&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;query&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;enum&nbsp;field,&nbsp;you&nbsp;can't&nbsp;give&nbsp;something&nbsp;a&nbsp;status<br>
of&nbsp;"APPROVED"&nbsp;until&nbsp;you&nbsp;make&nbsp;the&nbsp;perl&nbsp;changes.&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;this&nbsp;change&nbsp;I<br>
mentioned&nbsp;can&nbsp;also&nbsp;be&nbsp;done&nbsp;by&nbsp;editing&nbsp;checksetup.pl,&nbsp;which&nbsp;automates&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of<br>
this.&nbsp;But&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;know&nbsp;this&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;anyway,&nbsp;right?<br>

>There are a suite of Unix utilities for querying Bugzilla from the 
    command line. They live in the 
    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>contrib/cmdline</TT
> 
    directory. However, they
    have not yet been updated to work with 2.16 (post-templatisation.).
    There are three files - <TT

    <TT

CLASS="filename"
>bugs</TT

><TT
CLASS="filename"
>query.conf</TT
> 
    contains the mapping from options to field
    names and comparison types. Quoted option names are "grepped" for, so it
    should be easy to edit this file. Comments (#) have no effect; you must
    make sure these lines do not contain any quoted "option".</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="filename"
>buglist</TT
>
    is a shell script which submits a Bugzilla query and writes
    the resulting HTML page to stdout. It supports both short options, (such
    as "-Afoo" or "-Rbar") and long options (such as "--assignedto=foo" or
    "--reporter=bar"). If the first character of an option is not "-", it is
    treated as if it were prefixed with "--default=".</P
><P
>The column list is taken from the COLUMNLIST environment variable.
    This is equivalent to the "Change Columns" option when you list bugs in
    buglist.cgi. If you have already used Bugzilla, grep for COLUMNLIST
    in your cookies file to see your current COLUMNLIST setting.</P
><P
><TT
CLASS="filename"
>bugs</TT
> is a simple shell script which calls
    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>buglist</TT
> and extracts the
    bug numbers from the output. Adding the prefix
    "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=" turns the bug list into
    a working link if any bugs are found. Counting bugs is easy. Pipe the

    work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by
    others.</P

>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
    designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it
    can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether
    it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally
    for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P

><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
    notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed under
    the terms of this License. The "Document", below, refers to any such
    manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed
    as "you".</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
    modifications and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject. (For example, if the Document is in part a
    textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
    mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection
    with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial,
    philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose
    titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the
    notice that says that the Document is released under this License.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
    public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
    straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
    pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
    drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for
    automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text
    formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose
    markup has been designed to thwart or discourage subsequent modification
    by readers is not Transparent. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
    "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML
    designed for human modification. Opaque formats include PostScript, PDF,
    proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word
    processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not
    generally available, and the machine-generated HTML produced by some word
    processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
    which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text
    near the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the
    beginning of the body of the text.</P

>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
    copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to
    the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies
    you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P

><P
>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than
    100, and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must
    enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these
    Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts
    on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you
    as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full
    title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may
    add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document
    and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably)
    on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document
    numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable
    Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each
    Opaque copy a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a
    complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which
    the general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols. If you use the latter
    option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
    Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until
    at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy
    (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the
    public.</P
