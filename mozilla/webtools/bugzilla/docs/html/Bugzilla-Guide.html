>Took way too long to revise this for 2.12 release. Updated
	  FAQ to use qandaset tags instead of literallayout, cleaned
	  up administration section, added User Guide section,
	  miscellaneous FAQ updates and third-party integration
	  information. From this point on all new tags are lowercase
	  in preparation for the 2.13 release of the Guide in XML
	  format instead of SGML.</TD

>Things fixed this release: Elaborated on queryhelp
	  interface, added FAQ regarding moving bugs from one keyword
	  to another, clarified possible problems with the Landfill
	  tutorial, fixed a boatload of typos and unclear sentence
	  structures.  Incorporated the README into the UNIX
	  installation section, and changed the README to indicate the
	  deprecated status.  Things I know need work:  Used
	  "simplelist" a lot, where I should have used "procedure" to
	  tag things.  Need to lowercase all tags to be XML compliant.</TD

>	Bugzilla is an enterprise-class set of software utilities
	that, when used together, power issue-tracking for hundreds of
	organizations around the world, tracking millions of bugs.
	While it is easy to use and quite flexible, it is very
	difficult for a novice to install and maintain.  Although we
	have provided step-by-step directions, Bugzilla is not always
	easy to get working.  Please be sure the person responsible
	for installing and maintaining this software is a qualified
	professional on operating system upon which you install
	Bugzilla.

><P
>      This document was started on September 17, 2000 by Matthew P.
      Barnson after a great deal of procrastination updating the
      Bugzilla FAQ, which I left untouched for nearly half a year.
      After numerous complete rewrites and reformatting, it is the
      document you see today.
    </P
><P
>      Despite the lack of updates, Bugzilla is simply the best piece
      of bug-tracking software the world has ever seen.  This document
      is intended to be the comprehensive guide to  the installation,
      administration, maintenance, and use of the Bugzilla
      bug-tracking system.
    </P
><P
>      This release of the Bugzilla Guide is the
      <EM
>2.14.0</EM
> release. It is so named that it
      may match the current version of Bugzilla. The numbering
      tradition stems from that used for many free software projects,
      in which <EM
>even-numbered</EM
> point releases (1.2,
      1.14, etc.) are considered "stable releases", intended for
      public consumption; on the other  hand,
      <EM
>odd-numbered</EM
> point releases (1.3, 2.09,
      etc.) are considered unstable <EM
>development</EM
>
      releases intended for advanced users, systems administrators,
      developers, and those who enjoy a lot of pain. 
    </P
><P
>      Newer revisions of the Bugzilla Guide follow the numbering
      conventions of the main-tree Bugzilla releases, available at
      <A
HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bugzilla"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.mozilla.org/projects/bugzilla</A
>.  Intermediate releases will have
      a minor revision number following a period.  The current version
      of Bugzilla, as of this writing (August 10, 2001) is 2.14; if
      something were seriously wrong with that edition of the Guide,
      subsequent releases would receive an additional dotted-decimal
      digit to indicate the update (2.14.0.1, 2.14.0.2, etc.).
      Got it?  Good.
    </P
><P
>      I wrote this in response to the enormous demand for decent
      Bugzilla documentation. I have incorporated instructions from
      the Bugzilla README, Frequently Asked Questions, Database Schema
      Document, and various mailing lists to create it. Chances are,
      there are glaring errors in this documentation; please contact

>2.1. What is Bugzilla?</A
></H1
><P
>      Bugzilla is one example of a class of programs called "Defect
Tracking Systems", or, more commonly, "Bug-Tracking Systems".  Defect
Tracking Systems allow individual or groups of developers to keep
track of outstanding bugs in their product effectively. Bugzilla was
originally written by Terry Weissman in a programming language called
"TCL", to replace a crappy bug-tracking database used internally for
Netscape Communications.  Terry later ported Bugzilla to Perl from
TCL, and in Perl it remains to this day. Most commercial
defect-tracking software vendors at the time charged enormous
licensing fees, and Bugzilla quickly became a favorite of the
open-source crowd (with its genesis in the open-source browser
project, Mozilla).  It is now the de-facto standard defect-tracking
system against which all others are measured.
    </P
><P
>      Bugzilla has matured immensely, and now boasts many advanced features.  These include:
      <P

><UL
><LI
><P
>	    integrated, product-based granular security schema
	  </P

>	    a very well-understood and well-thought-out natural bug resolution protocol
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	    email, XML, console, and HTTP APIs
	  </P
></LI

	    Perforce and CVS
	  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	    too many more features to list
	  </P
></LI
></UL
>
    </P
><P
>      Despite its current robustness and popularity, however, Bugzilla
      faces some near-term challenges, such as reliance on a single database, a lack of
      abstraction of the user interface and program logic, verbose email bug
      notifications, a powerful but daunting query interface, little reporting configurability,
      problems with extremely large queries, some unsupportable bug resolution options,
      no internationalization, and dependence on some nonstandard libraries.
    </P
><P
>      Some recent headway has been made on the query front, however.  If you are using the latest
      version of Bugzilla, you should see a "simple search" form on the default front page of
      your Bugzilla install.  Type in two or three search terms and you should pull up some
      relevant information.  This is also available as "queryhelp.cgi".
    </P
><P
>      Despite these small problems, Bugzilla is very hard to beat.  It is under <EM
>very</EM
>
      active development to address the current issues, and a long-awaited overhaul in the form
      of Bugzilla 3.0 is expected sometime later this year.

>      For many years, defect-tracking software has remained principally the domain
      of large software development houses.  Even then, most shops never bothered
      with bug-tracking software, and instead simply relied on shared lists and
      email to monitor the status of defects.  This procedure is error-prone and
      tends to cause those bugs judged least significant by developers to be
      dropped or ignored.
    </P
><P
>      These days, many companies are finding that integrated defect-tracking
      systems reduce downtime, increase productivity, and raise customer 
      satisfaction with their systems.  Along with full disclosure, an open
      bug-tracker allows manufacturers to keep in touch with their clients
      and resellers, to communicate about problems effectively throughout
      the data management chain.  Many corporations have also discovered that
      defect-tracking helps reduce costs by providing IT support accountability,
      telephone support knowledge bases, and a common, well-understood system
      for accounting for unusual system or software issues.
    </P
><P
>      But why should <EM
>you</EM
> use Bugzilla?
    </P
><P
>      Bugzilla is very adaptable to various situations.  Known uses currently
      include IT support queues, Systems Administration deployment management,
      chip design and development problem tracking (both pre-and-post fabrication),
      and software and hardware bug tracking for luminaries such as Redhat, Loki software,
      Linux-Mandrake, and VA Systems.  Combined with systems such as CVS, Bonsai,
      or Perforce SCM, Bugzilla provides a powerful, easy-to-use  solution to
      configuration management and replication problems
    </P
><P
>      Bugzilla can dramatically increase the productivity and accountability
      of individual employees by providing a documented workflow and positive
      feedback for good performance.  How many times do you wake up in the
      morning, remembering that you were supposed to do *something* today,
      but you just can't quite remember?  Put it in Bugzilla, and you have a record
      of it from which you can extrapolate milestones, predict product versions
      for integration, and by using Bugzilla's e-mail integration features
      be able to follow the discussion trail that led to critical decisions.
    </P
><P
>      Ultimately, Bugzilla puts the power in your hands to improve your value
      to your employer or business while providing a usable framework for your natural
      attention to detail and knowledge store to flourish.

      Although Landfill serves as a great introduction to Bugzilla, it does not offer
      all the options you would have as a user on your own installation of Bugzilla,
      nor can it do more than serve as a general introduction to Bugzilla.  Additionally,
      Landfill often runs cutting-edge versions of Bugzilla for testing, so some things
      may work slightly differently than mentioned here.

      </P

      </P
><P

	nearly every box you see on your screen has a hyperlink nearby, explaining what
	it is or what it does.  Near the upper-left-hand corner of your browser window
	you should see the word "Status" underlined.  Select it.
      </P

	is a hyperlink that will take you to context-sensitive help.
	Click around for a while, and learn what everything here does.  To return

	your browser.
      </P

	    are NEW, ASSIGNED, or REOPENED, which is what we want.  If you don't select anything
	    in the other 5 scrollboxes there, then you are saying that "any of these are OK";

	    product.  In many cases, though, Milestones simply represent significant dates for
	    a developer.  Having certain features in your Product is frequently
	    tied to revenue (money)
	    the developer will receive if the features work by the time she 
	    reaches the Target Milestone.
	    Target Milestones are a great tool to organize your time.
	    If someone will pay you $100,000 for
	    incorporating certain features by a certain date,
	    those features by that Milestone date become
	    a very high priority.  Milestones tend to be highly malleable creatures,
	    though, that appear
	    to be in reach but are out of reach by the time the important day arrives.

	    Bugzilla versions 2.14, 2.16, 2.18, 3.0, etc.  However,

	    code name, or weird alphanumeric
	    combination, like "M19".

></H1
><P
>      There are a lot of common libraries and utilities out there
      that Apple did not include with Mac OS X, but which run
      perfectly well on it.  The GD library, which Bugzilla needs to
      do bug graphs, is one of these.
    </P
><P
>      The easiest way to get a lot of these is with a program called
      Fink, which is similar in nature to the CPAN installer, but
      installs common GNU utilities.  Fink is available from
      &#60;http://sourceforge.net/projects/fink/&#62;.
    </P
><P
>      Follow the instructions for setting up Fink.  Once it's
      installed, you'll want to run the following as root:
      <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>fink install gd</B
>
    </P
><P
>      It will prompt you for a number of dependencies, type 'y' and
      hit enter to install all of the dependencies.  Then watch it
      work.
    </P
><P
>      To prevent creating conflicts with the software that Apple
      installs by default, Fink creates its own directory tree at
      /sw where it installs most of the software that it installs.
      This means your libraries and headers for libgd will be at
      /sw/lib and /sw/include instead of /usr/lib and
      /usr/local/include.  Because of these changed locations for
      the libraries, the Perl GD module will not install directly
      via CPAN (it looks for the specific paths instead of getting
      them from your environment).  But there's a way around that
      :-)
    </P
><P
>      Instead of typing <SPAN

> at the
      <TT
CLASS="PROMPT"
>cpan&#62;</TT
> prompt, type <B
CLASS="COMMAND"
>look
	GD</B
>.  This should go through the motions of
      downloading the latest version of the GD module, then it will
      open a shell and drop you into the build directory. Apply the
      following patch to the Makefile.PL file (save the patch into a
      file  and use the command <B

guide&nbsp;(at&nbsp;http://www.trilobyte.net/barnsons/html/).<br>
<br>
Step&nbsp;1:<br>
I've&nbsp;used&nbsp;apache,&nbsp;installation&nbsp;is&nbsp;really&nbsp;straightforward.<br>
After&nbsp;reading&nbsp;the&nbsp;Unix&nbsp;installation&nbsp;instructions,&nbsp;I&nbsp;found&nbsp;that&nbsp;it&nbsp;is<br>
necessary&nbsp;to&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;ExecCGI&nbsp;option&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;bugzilla&nbsp;directory.&nbsp;Also&nbsp;the<br>
'AddHandler'&nbsp;line&nbsp;for&nbsp;.cgi&nbsp;is&nbsp;by&nbsp;default&nbsp;commented&nbsp;out.<br>
<br>
Step&nbsp;3:&nbsp;although&nbsp;just&nbsp;a&nbsp;detail,&nbsp;'ppm&nbsp;install&nbsp;&#60;module%gt;'&nbsp;will&nbsp;also&nbsp;work<br>
(without&nbsp;.ppd).&nbsp;And,&nbsp;it&nbsp;can&nbsp;also&nbsp;download&nbsp;these&nbsp;automatically&nbsp;from<br>
ActiveState.<br>
<br>
Step&nbsp;4:&nbsp;although&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;cygwin&nbsp;installed,&nbsp;it&nbsp;seems&nbsp;that&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;necessary.<br>
On&nbsp;my&nbsp;machine&nbsp;cygwin&nbsp;is&nbsp;not&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;PATH&nbsp;and&nbsp;everything&nbsp;seems&nbsp;to&nbsp;work&nbsp;as<br>
expected.<br>
However,&nbsp;I've&nbsp;not&nbsp;used&nbsp;everything&nbsp;yet.<br>
<br>

>	  Groups in Bugzilla are a complicated beast that evolved out
	  of very simple user permission bitmasks, apparently itself
	  derived from common concepts in UNIX access controls.  A
	  "bitmask" is a fixed-length number whose value can describe
	  one, and only one, set of states.  For instance, UNIX file
	  permissions are assigned bitmask values:  "execute" has a
	  value of 1, "write" has a value of 2,  and "read" has a
	  value of 4.  Add them together, and a file can be read,
	  written to, and executed if it has a bitmask of "7". (This
	  is a simplified example -- anybody who knows UNIX security
	  knows there is much more to it than this.  Please bear with
	  me for the purpose of this note.)  The only way a bitmask
	  scheme can work is by doubling the bit count for each value.
	  Thus if UNIX wanted to offer another file permission, the
	  next would have to be a value of 8, then the next 16, the
	  next 32, etc.
	</P
><P
>	  Similarly, Bugzilla offers a bitmask to define group
	  permissions, with an internal limit of 64.  Several are
	  already occupied by built-in permissions.  The way around
	  this limitation is to avoid assigning groups to products if
	  you have many products, avoid bloating of group lists, and
	  religiously prune irrelevant groups.  In reality, most
	  installations of Bugzilla support far fewer than 64 groups,
	  so this limitation has not hit for most sites, but it is on
	  the table to be revised for Bugzilla 3.0 because it
	  interferes with the security schemes of some administrators.

      have synchronization problems, the easiest way to avoid them is to only put the bug
      information, comments, etc. into Bugzilla, and not into the Perforce change records.
      They will link anyway; merely reference the bug ID fixed in your change description,
      and put a comment into Bugzilla
      giving the change ID that fixed the Bugzilla bug.  It's a process issue, not a technology
      question.

><P

		    Unfortunately there will have to be some

		will need to back out alot of things that are not

><P
>		     I suppose the current thread warrants an update
		on the status of Oracle and bugzilla ;) We have now
		been running Bugzilla 2.8 on Oracle for the last two
		days in our production environment. I tried to do as
		much testing as possible with it before going live
		which is some of the reason for the long delay. I did
		not get enough feedback as I would have liked from
		internal developers to help weed out any bugs still
		left so I said "Fine, i will take it live and then I
		will get the feedback I want :)" So it is now starting
		to stabilize and it running quite well after working
		feverishly the last two days fixing problems as soon
		as they came in from the outside world. The current
		branch in cvs is up2date if anyone would like to grab
		it and try it out. The oracle _setup.pl is broken
		right now due to some last minute changes but I will
		update that soon. Therefore you would probably need to
		create the database tables the old fashioned way using
		the supplied sql creation scripts located in the
		./oracle directory. We have heavy optimizations in the
		database it self thanks to the in-house DBA here at
		Red Hat so it is running quite fast. The database
		itself is located on a dual PII450 with 1GB ram and 14
		high voltage differential raided scsi drives. The
		tables and indexes are partitioned in 4 chuncks across
		the raided drive which is nice because when ever you
		need to do a full table scan, it is actually starting
		in 4 different locations on 4 different drives
		simultaneously. And the indexes of course are on
		separate drives from the data so that speeds things up
		tremendously. When  I can find the time I will
		document all that we have done to get this thing going
		to help others that may need it.
	      </P
><P
>		As Matt has mentioned it is still using out-dated code
		and with a little help I would like to bring
		everything up to date for eventual  incorporation with
		the main cvs tree. Due to other duties I have with the
		company any help with this wiould be appreciated. What
		we are using  now is what I call a best first effort.
		It definitely can be improved on and may even need
		complete rewrites in a lot of areas. A lot of changes
		may have to be made in the way Bugzilla does things
		currently  to make this transition to a more generic
		database interface.  Fortunately when making the
		Oracle changes I made sure I didn't do  anything that
		I would consider Oracle specific and could not be
		easily done with other databases. Alot of the sql
		statements need to be broken up into smaller utilities
		that themselves would need to make decisions on what
		database they are using but the majority of the code
		can be made database neutral.

		Bugzilla-- our patches weren't suitable for

		in the code. Fenris has one major  improvement over
		Bugzilla, and that is individual comments are not
		appended onto a string blob, they are stored as a
		record in a separate table. This allows you to, for
		instance, separate comments out according to privilege
		levels in case your bug database could contain
		sensitive information not for public eyes. We also
		provide things like email hiding to protect user's
		privacy, additional fields such as 'user_affected' in

	    the shadow database in editparams.cgi. If you wish to

	    user run "./syncshadowdb -syncall" from the command line
	    in the bugzilla installation directory to recreate your

	    you can use the mysqladmin utility to manually insert,

Ultimately, it's as easy as adding the "---" priority field to your localconfig file in the appropriate area, re-running checksetup.pl, and then changing the default priority in your browser using "editparams.cgi".  Hmm, now that I think about it, that is kind of a klunky way to handle it, but for now it's what we have!  Although the bug has been closed "resolved wontfix", there may be a better way to handle this...

>C.2. MySQL Bugzilla Database Introduction</A
></H1
><P
>      This information comes straight from my life.  I was forced to learn how
      Bugzilla organizes database because of nitpicky requests from users for tiny
      changes in wording, rather than having people re-educate themselves or
      figure out how to work our procedures around the tool.  It sucks, but it can
      and will happen to you, so learn how the schema works and deal with it when it
      comes.
    </P
><P
>      So, here you are with your brand-new installation of Bugzilla.  You've got
      MySQL set up, Apache working right, Perl DBI and DBD talking to the database
      flawlessly.  Maybe you've even entered a few test bugs to make sure email's
      working; people seem to be notified of new bugs and changes, and you can
      enter and edit bugs to your heart's content.  Perhaps you've gone through the
      trouble of setting up a gateway for people to submit bugs to your database via
      email, have had a few people test it, and received rave reviews from your beta
      testers.
    </P
><P
>      What's the next thing you do?  Outline a training strategy for your
      development team, of course, and bring them up to speed on the new tool you've
      labored over for hours.
    </P
><P
>      Your first training session starts off very well!  You have a captive
      audience which seems enraptured by the efficiency embodied in this thing called
      "Bugzilla".  You are caught up describing the nifty features, how people can
      save favorite queries in the database, set them up as headers and footers on
      their pages, customize their layouts, generate reports, track status with
      greater efficiency than ever before, leap tall buildings with a single bound
      and rescue Jane from the clutches of Certain Death!
    </P
><P
>      But Certain Death speaks up -- a tiny voice, from the dark corners of the
      conference room.  "I have a concern," the voice hisses from the darkness,
      "about the use of the word 'verified'.
    </P
><P
>      The room, previously filled with happy chatter, lapses into reverential
      silence as Certain Death (better known as the Vice President of Software
      Engineering) continues.  "You see, for two years we've used the word 'verified'
      to indicate that a developer or quality assurance engineer has confirmed that,
      in fact, a bug is valid. I don't want to lose two years of training to a
      new software product.  You need to change the bug status of 'verified' to
      'approved' as soon as possible. To avoid confusion, of course."
    </P
><P
>      Oh no!  Terror strikes your heart, as you find yourself mumbling "yes, yes, I
      don't think that would be a problem," You review the changes with Certain
      Death, and continue to jabber on, "no, it's not too big a change. I mean, we
      have the source code, right? You know, 'Use the Source, Luke' and all that...
      no problem," All the while you quiver inside like a beached jellyfish bubbling,
      burbling, and boiling on a hot Jamaican sand dune...
    </P
><P
>      Thus begins your adventure into the heart of Bugzilla.  You've been forced
      to learn about non-portable enum() fields, varchar columns, and tinyint
      definitions. The Adventure Awaits You!

identify&nbsp;group&nbsp;memberships.&nbsp;&nbsp;For&nbsp;instance,&nbsp;say&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to<br>
tweak&nbsp;parameters&nbsp;is&nbsp;assigned&nbsp;a&nbsp;value&nbsp;of&nbsp;"1",&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;that&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;edit<br>

assigned&nbsp;the&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;of&nbsp;"4".&nbsp;&nbsp;By&nbsp;uniquely&nbsp;combining&nbsp;the&nbsp;group&nbsp;bitmasks&nbsp;(much<br>
like&nbsp;the&nbsp;chmod&nbsp;command&nbsp;in&nbsp;UNIX,)&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;identify&nbsp;a&nbsp;user&nbsp;is&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;to&nbsp;tweak<br>
parameters&nbsp;and&nbsp;create&nbsp;groups,&nbsp;but&nbsp;not&nbsp;edit&nbsp;users,&nbsp;by&nbsp;giving&nbsp;him&nbsp;a&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;of<br>

parameters,&nbsp;by&nbsp;giving&nbsp;him&nbsp;a&nbsp;bitmask&nbsp;of&nbsp;"6"&nbsp;Simple,&nbsp;huh?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;this&nbsp;makes&nbsp;no&nbsp;sense&nbsp;to&nbsp;you,&nbsp;try&nbsp;this&nbsp;at&nbsp;the&nbsp;mysql&nbsp;prompt:<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll&nbsp;see&nbsp;the&nbsp;list,&nbsp;it&nbsp;makes&nbsp;much&nbsp;more&nbsp;sense&nbsp;that&nbsp;way.<br>

THE&nbsp;DETAILS<br>
===<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Ahh,&nbsp;so&nbsp;you're&nbsp;wondering&nbsp;just&nbsp;what&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;information&nbsp;above?&nbsp;&nbsp;At&nbsp;the<br>
mysql&nbsp;prompt,&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;view&nbsp;any&nbsp;information&nbsp;about&nbsp;the&nbsp;columns&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;table&nbsp;with<br>
this&nbsp;command&nbsp;(where&nbsp;"table"&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;table&nbsp;you&nbsp;wish&nbsp;to&nbsp;view):<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;show&nbsp;columns&nbsp;from&nbsp;table;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;can&nbsp;also&nbsp;view&nbsp;all&nbsp;the&nbsp;data&nbsp;in&nbsp;a&nbsp;table&nbsp;with&nbsp;this&nbsp;command:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;table;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;note:&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;very&nbsp;bad&nbsp;idea&nbsp;to&nbsp;do&nbsp;on,&nbsp;for&nbsp;instance,&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"&nbsp;table&nbsp;if<br>
you&nbsp;have&nbsp;50,000&nbsp;bugs.&nbsp;&nbsp;You'll&nbsp;be&nbsp;sitting&nbsp;there&nbsp;a&nbsp;while&nbsp;until&nbsp;you&nbsp;ctrl-c&nbsp;or<br>
50,000&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;play&nbsp;across&nbsp;your&nbsp;screen.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;can&nbsp;limit&nbsp;the&nbsp;display&nbsp;from&nbsp;above&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;command,&nbsp;where<br>
"column"&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;column&nbsp;for&nbsp;which&nbsp;you&nbsp;wish&nbsp;to&nbsp;restrict&nbsp;information:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;table&nbsp;where&nbsp;(column&nbsp;=&nbsp;"some&nbsp;info");<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;--&nbsp;or&nbsp;the&nbsp;reverse&nbsp;of&nbsp;this<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;select&nbsp;*&nbsp;from&nbsp;table&nbsp;where&nbsp;(column&nbsp;!=&nbsp;"some&nbsp;info");<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's&nbsp;take&nbsp;our&nbsp;example&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;introduction,&nbsp;and&nbsp;assume&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;change<br>
the&nbsp;word&nbsp;"verified"&nbsp;to&nbsp;"approved"&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;field.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;know&nbsp;from&nbsp;the<br>
above&nbsp;information&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;resolution&nbsp;is&nbsp;likely&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"<br>
table.&nbsp;Note&nbsp;we'll&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;change&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;perl&nbsp;code&nbsp;as&nbsp;well&nbsp;as&nbsp;this&nbsp;database<br>
change,&nbsp;but&nbsp;I&nbsp;won't&nbsp;plunge&nbsp;into&nbsp;that&nbsp;in&nbsp;this&nbsp;document.&nbsp;Let's&nbsp;verify&nbsp;the<br>
information&nbsp;is&nbsp;stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"&nbsp;table:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;show&nbsp;columns&nbsp;from&nbsp;bugs<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(exceedingly&nbsp;long&nbsp;output&nbsp;truncated&nbsp;here)<br>
|&nbsp;bug_status|&nbsp;enum('UNCONFIRMED','NEW','ASSIGNED','REOPENED','RESOLVED','VERIFIED','CLOSED')||MUL&nbsp;|&nbsp;UNCONFIRMED||<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry&nbsp;about&nbsp;that&nbsp;long&nbsp;line.&nbsp;&nbsp;We&nbsp;see&nbsp;from&nbsp;this&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bug&nbsp;status"&nbsp;column&nbsp;is<br>
an&nbsp;"enum&nbsp;field",&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;a&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;peculiarity&nbsp;where&nbsp;a&nbsp;string&nbsp;type&nbsp;field&nbsp;can<br>
only&nbsp;have&nbsp;certain&nbsp;types&nbsp;of&nbsp;entries.&nbsp;&nbsp;While&nbsp;I&nbsp;think&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;very&nbsp;cool,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;not<br>
standard&nbsp;SQL.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway,&nbsp;we&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;add&nbsp;the&nbsp;possible&nbsp;enum&nbsp;field&nbsp;entry<br>
'APPROVED'&nbsp;by&nbsp;altering&nbsp;the&nbsp;"bugs"&nbsp;table.<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;ALTER&nbsp;table&nbsp;bugs&nbsp;CHANGE&nbsp;bug_status&nbsp;bug_status<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;enum("UNCONFIRMED",&nbsp;"NEW",&nbsp;"ASSIGNED",&nbsp;"REOPENED",&nbsp;"RESOLVED",<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&#62;&nbsp;"VERIFIED",&nbsp;"APPROVED",&nbsp;"CLOSED")&nbsp;not&nbsp;null;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(note&nbsp;we&nbsp;can&nbsp;take&nbsp;three&nbsp;lines&nbsp;or&nbsp;more&nbsp;--&nbsp;whatever&nbsp;you&nbsp;put&nbsp;in&nbsp;before&nbsp;the<br>
semicolon&nbsp;is&nbsp;evaluated&nbsp;as&nbsp;a&nbsp;single&nbsp;expression)<br>
<br>
Now&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;do&nbsp;this:<br>
<br>
mysql&#62;&nbsp;show&nbsp;columns&nbsp;from&nbsp;bugs;<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;see&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;bug_status&nbsp;field&nbsp;has&nbsp;an&nbsp;extra&nbsp;"APPROVED"&nbsp;enum&nbsp;that's<br>
available!&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool&nbsp;thing,&nbsp;too,&nbsp;is&nbsp;that&nbsp;this&nbsp;is&nbsp;reflected&nbsp;on&nbsp;your&nbsp;query&nbsp;page&nbsp;as<br>
well&nbsp;--&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;query&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;new&nbsp;status.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;how's&nbsp;it&nbsp;fit&nbsp;into&nbsp;the&nbsp;existing<br>
scheme&nbsp;of&nbsp;things?<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Looks&nbsp;like&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back&nbsp;and&nbsp;look&nbsp;for&nbsp;instances&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;word&nbsp;"verified"<br>
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;perl&nbsp;code&nbsp;for&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;--&nbsp;wherever&nbsp;you&nbsp;find&nbsp;"verified",&nbsp;change&nbsp;it&nbsp;to<br>
"approved"&nbsp;and&nbsp;you're&nbsp;in&nbsp;business&nbsp;(make&nbsp;sure&nbsp;that's&nbsp;a&nbsp;case-insensitive&nbsp;search).<br>
Although&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;query&nbsp;by&nbsp;the&nbsp;enum&nbsp;field,&nbsp;you&nbsp;can't&nbsp;give&nbsp;something&nbsp;a&nbsp;status<br>
of&nbsp;"APPROVED"&nbsp;until&nbsp;you&nbsp;make&nbsp;the&nbsp;perl&nbsp;changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;this&nbsp;change&nbsp;I<br>
mentioned&nbsp;can&nbsp;also&nbsp;be&nbsp;done&nbsp;by&nbsp;editing&nbsp;checksetup.pl,&nbsp;which&nbsp;automates&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of<br>
this.&nbsp;&nbsp;But&nbsp;you&nbsp;need&nbsp;to&nbsp;know&nbsp;this&nbsp;stuff&nbsp;anyway,&nbsp;right?<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;hope&nbsp;this&nbsp;database&nbsp;tutorial&nbsp;has&nbsp;been&nbsp;useful&nbsp;for&nbsp;you.&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;you&nbsp;have&nbsp;comments<br>

>The following portion of documentation comes from my
	answer to an old discussion of Keystone, a cool product that
	does trouble-ticket tracking for IT departments.  I wrote this
	post to the  Keystone support group regarding MySQL grant
	table permissions, and how to use them effectively. It is
	badly in need of updating, as I believe MySQL has added a
	field or two to the grant tables  since this time, but it
	serves as a decent introduction and troubleshooting document
	for grant table issues.  I used Keynote to track my troubles
	until I discovered Bugzilla, which gave me a whole new set of
	troubles to work on : )  Although it is of limited use, it
	still has SOME use, thus it's still included.</P
><P
>	Please note, however, that I was a relatively new user to
	MySQL at the time.  Some of my suggestions, particularly in
	how to set up security, showed a terrible lack of
	security-related database experience.

<br>
Maybe&nbsp;we&nbsp;can&nbsp;include&nbsp;this&nbsp;rambling&nbsp;message&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;Keystone&nbsp;FAQ?&nbsp;&nbsp;It&nbsp;gets<br>
asked&nbsp;a&nbsp;lot,&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;only&nbsp;option&nbsp;current&nbsp;listed&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;FAQ&nbsp;is<br>
"--skip-grant-tables".<br>
<br>
Really,&nbsp;you&nbsp;can't&nbsp;go&nbsp;wrong&nbsp;by&nbsp;reading&nbsp;section&nbsp;6&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;manual,&nbsp;at<br>
http://www.mysql.com/Manual/manual.html.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;sure&nbsp;their&nbsp;description&nbsp;is<br>
better&nbsp;than&nbsp;mine.<br>
<br>
MySQL&nbsp;runs&nbsp;fine&nbsp;without&nbsp;permissions&nbsp;set&nbsp;up&nbsp;correctly&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;run&nbsp;the&nbsp;mysql<br>
daemon&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;"--skip-grant-tables"&nbsp;option.&nbsp;&nbsp;Running&nbsp;this&nbsp;way&nbsp;denies<br>
access&nbsp;to&nbsp;nobody.&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately,&nbsp;unless&nbsp;you've&nbsp;got&nbsp;yourself&nbsp;firewalled&nbsp;it<br>
also&nbsp;opens&nbsp;the&nbsp;potential&nbsp;for&nbsp;abuse&nbsp;if&nbsp;someone&nbsp;knows&nbsp;you're&nbsp;running&nbsp;it.<br>
<br>
Additionally,&nbsp;the&nbsp;default&nbsp;permissions&nbsp;for&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;allow&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;at&nbsp;localhost<br>
access&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;database&nbsp;if&nbsp;the&nbsp;database&nbsp;name&nbsp;begins&nbsp;with&nbsp;"test_"&nbsp;or&nbsp;is&nbsp;named<br>
"test"&nbsp;(i.e.&nbsp;"test_keystone").&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;can&nbsp;change&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;your&nbsp;database&nbsp;in<br>
the&nbsp;keystone.conf&nbsp;file&nbsp;($sys_dbname).&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;way&nbsp;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;doing&nbsp;it&nbsp;for<br>
some&nbsp;of&nbsp;my&nbsp;databases,&nbsp;and&nbsp;it&nbsp;works&nbsp;fine.<br>
<br>
The&nbsp;methods&nbsp;described&nbsp;below&nbsp;assume&nbsp;you're&nbsp;running&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;box&nbsp;as<br>
your&nbsp;webserver,&nbsp;and&nbsp;that&nbsp;you&nbsp;don't&nbsp;mind&nbsp;if&nbsp;your&nbsp;$sys_dbuser&nbsp;for&nbsp;Keystone&nbsp;has<br>
superuser&nbsp;access.&nbsp;&nbsp;See&nbsp;near&nbsp;the&nbsp;bottom&nbsp;of&nbsp;this&nbsp;message&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;description&nbsp;of<br>
what&nbsp;each&nbsp;field&nbsp;does.<br>
<br>
Method&nbsp;#1:<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/var/lib<br>
	#location&nbsp;where&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;want&nbsp;to&nbsp;run&nbsp;/usr/bin/mysql_install_db&nbsp;shell<br>
script&nbsp;from&nbsp;to&nbsp;get&nbsp;it&nbsp;to&nbsp;work.<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;ln&nbsp;-s&nbsp;mysql&nbsp;data&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	#&nbsp;soft&nbsp;links&nbsp;the&nbsp;"mysql"&nbsp;directory&nbsp;to&nbsp;"data",&nbsp;which&nbsp;is&nbsp;what<br>
mysql_install_db&nbsp;expects.&nbsp;&nbsp;Alternately,&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;edit&nbsp;mysql_install_db&nbsp;and<br>
change&nbsp;all&nbsp;the&nbsp;"./data"&nbsp;references&nbsp;to&nbsp;"./mysql".<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit&nbsp;/usr/bin/mysql_install_db&nbsp;with&nbsp;your&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;text&nbsp;editor&nbsp;(vi,<br>
emacs,&nbsp;jot,&nbsp;pico,&nbsp;etc.)<br>
A)&nbsp;&nbsp;Copy&nbsp;the&nbsp;"INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;db&nbsp;VALUES<br>
('%','test\_%','','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');"&nbsp;and&nbsp;paste&nbsp;it&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;after<br>
itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;Chage&nbsp;the&nbsp;'test\_%'&nbsp;value&nbsp;to&nbsp;'keystone',&nbsp;or&nbsp;the&nbsp;value&nbsp;of<br>
$sys_dbname&nbsp;in&nbsp;keystone.conf.<br>
B)&nbsp;&nbsp;If&nbsp;you&nbsp;are&nbsp;running&nbsp;your&nbsp;keystone&nbsp;database&nbsp;with&nbsp;any&nbsp;user,&nbsp;you'll&nbsp;need&nbsp;to<br>
copy&nbsp;the&nbsp;"INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;user&nbsp;VALUES<br>
('localhost','root','','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y');"&nbsp;line&nbsp;after<br>
itself&nbsp;and&nbsp;change&nbsp;'root'&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;name&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;keystone&nbsp;database&nbsp;user<br>
($sys_dbuser)&nbsp;in&nbsp;keystone.conf.<br>
<br>
	#&nbsp;adds&nbsp;entries&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;script&nbsp;to&nbsp;create&nbsp;grant&nbsp;tables&nbsp;for&nbsp;specific<br>
hosts&nbsp;and&nbsp;users.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;user&nbsp;you&nbsp;set&nbsp;up&nbsp;has&nbsp;super-user&nbsp;access&nbsp;($sys_dbuser)&nbsp;--<br>
you&nbsp;may&nbsp;or&nbsp;may&nbsp;not&nbsp;want&nbsp;this.&nbsp;&nbsp;The&nbsp;layout&nbsp;of&nbsp;mysql_install_db&nbsp;is&nbsp;really&nbsp;very<br>
uncomplicated.<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/bin/mysqladmin&nbsp;shutdown<br>
	#&nbsp;ya&nbsp;gotta&nbsp;shut&nbsp;it&nbsp;down&nbsp;before&nbsp;you&nbsp;can&nbsp;reinstall&nbsp;the&nbsp;grant&nbsp;tables!<br>
<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;rm&nbsp;-i&nbsp;/var/lib/mysql/mysql/*.IS?'&nbsp;and&nbsp;answer&nbsp;'Y'&nbsp;to&nbsp;the&nbsp;deletion<br>
questions.<br>
	#&nbsp;nuke&nbsp;your&nbsp;current&nbsp;grant&nbsp;tables.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;WILL&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;delete&nbsp;any&nbsp;other<br>
databases&nbsp;than&nbsp;your&nbsp;grant&nbsp;tables.<br>
<br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;/usr/bin/mysql_install_db<br>
	#&nbsp;run&nbsp;the&nbsp;script&nbsp;you&nbsp;just&nbsp;edited&nbsp;to&nbsp;install&nbsp;your&nbsp;new&nbsp;grant&nbsp;tables.<br>
<br>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;mysqladmin&nbsp;-u&nbsp;root&nbsp;password&nbsp;(new_password)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	#&nbsp;change&nbsp;the&nbsp;root&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;password,&nbsp;or&nbsp;else&nbsp;anyone&nbsp;on&nbsp;localhost&nbsp;can<br>
login&nbsp;to&nbsp;MySQL&nbsp;as&nbsp;root&nbsp;and&nbsp;make&nbsp;changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;You&nbsp;can&nbsp;skip&nbsp;this&nbsp;step&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;want<br>
keystone&nbsp;to&nbsp;connect&nbsp;as&nbsp;root&nbsp;with&nbsp;no&nbsp;password.<br>
<br>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;mysqladmin&nbsp;-u&nbsp;(webserver_user_name)&nbsp;password&nbsp;(new_password)&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
	#&nbsp;change&nbsp;the&nbsp;password&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;$sys_dbuser.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;you&nbsp;will&nbsp;need<br>
to&nbsp;change&nbsp;the&nbsp;password&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;keystone.conf&nbsp;file&nbsp;as&nbsp;well&nbsp;in&nbsp;$sys_dbpasswd,<br>
and&nbsp;if&nbsp;your&nbsp;permissions&nbsp;are&nbsp;set&nbsp;up&nbsp;incorrectly&nbsp;anybody&nbsp;can&nbsp;type&nbsp;the&nbsp;URL&nbsp;to<br>
your&nbsp;keystone.conf&nbsp;file&nbsp;and&nbsp;get&nbsp;the&nbsp;password.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not&nbsp;that&nbsp;this&nbsp;will&nbsp;help&nbsp;them<br>
much&nbsp;if&nbsp;your&nbsp;permissions&nbsp;are&nbsp;set&nbsp;to&nbsp;@localhost.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Method&nbsp;#2:&nbsp;&nbsp;easier,&nbsp;but&nbsp;a&nbsp;pain&nbsp;reproducing&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;have&nbsp;to&nbsp;delete&nbsp;your&nbsp;grant<br>
tables.&nbsp;&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;the&nbsp;"recommended"&nbsp;method&nbsp;for&nbsp;altering&nbsp;grant&nbsp;tables&nbsp;in<br>
MySQL.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;don't&nbsp;use&nbsp;it&nbsp;because&nbsp;I&nbsp;like&nbsp;the&nbsp;other&nbsp;way&nbsp;:)<br>

account&nbsp;defined&nbsp;in&nbsp;keystone.conf.&nbsp;&nbsp;However,&nbsp;if&nbsp;you&nbsp;are&nbsp;runnning&nbsp;many<br>
different&nbsp;MySQL-based&nbsp;apps,&nbsp;as&nbsp;we&nbsp;are,&nbsp;it's&nbsp;generally&nbsp;better&nbsp;to&nbsp;edit&nbsp;the<br>
mysql_install_db&nbsp;script&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able&nbsp;to&nbsp;quickly&nbsp;reproduce&nbsp;your&nbsp;permissions<br>
structure&nbsp;again.&nbsp;&nbsp;Note&nbsp;that&nbsp;the&nbsp;FILE&nbsp;privelege&nbsp;and&nbsp;WITH&nbsp;GRANT&nbsp;OPTION&nbsp;may&nbsp;not<br>
be&nbsp;in&nbsp;your&nbsp;best&nbsp;interest&nbsp;to&nbsp;include.<br>

      One of the major benefits of Red Hat Bugzilla is the ability to work with Oracle as a
      database, as well as MySQL.

up&nbsp;with&nbsp;email&nbsp;this&nbsp;past&nbsp;week.&nbsp;I&nbsp;have&nbsp;checked&nbsp;out&nbsp;your&nbsp;updated&nbsp;documentation&nbsp;and&nbsp;I&nbsp;will<br>
have&nbsp;to&nbsp;say&nbsp;very&nbsp;good&nbsp;work.&nbsp;A&nbsp;few&nbsp;notes&nbsp;and&nbsp;additions&nbsp;as&nbsp;follows.<br>
<br>
(ed:&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;FAQ)<br>
&#62;For&nbsp;the&nbsp;record,&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;not&nbsp;using&nbsp;any&nbsp;template&nbsp;type&nbsp;implementation&nbsp;for&nbsp;the&nbsp;cosmetic&nbsp;changes&nbsp;<br>
&#62;maded&nbsp;to&nbsp;Bugzilla.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is&nbsp;just&nbsp;alot&nbsp;of&nbsp;html&nbsp;changes&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;code&nbsp;itself.&nbsp;I&nbsp;admit&nbsp;I&nbsp;may&nbsp;have&nbsp;<br>
&#62;gotten&nbsp;a&nbsp;little&nbsp;carried&nbsp;away&nbsp;with&nbsp;it&nbsp;but&nbsp;the&nbsp;corporate&nbsp;types&nbsp;asked&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;more&nbsp;standardized&nbsp;<br>
&#62;interface&nbsp;to&nbsp;match&nbsp;up&nbsp;with&nbsp;other&nbsp;projects&nbsp;relating&nbsp;to&nbsp;Red&nbsp;Hat&nbsp;web&nbsp;sites.&nbsp;A&nbsp;lot&nbsp;of&nbsp;other&nbsp;web&nbsp;<br>
&#62;based&nbsp;internal&nbsp;tools&nbsp;I&nbsp;am&nbsp;working&nbsp;on&nbsp;also&nbsp;look&nbsp;like&nbsp;Bugzilla.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
<br>
This&nbsp;should&nbsp;probably&nbsp;be&nbsp;changed&nbsp;since&nbsp;we&nbsp;are&nbsp;now&nbsp;in&nbsp;fact&nbsp;using&nbsp;Text::Template&nbsp;for&nbsp;most<br>
of&nbsp;the&nbsp;html&nbsp;rendering.&nbsp;You&nbsp;actually&nbsp;state&nbsp;this&nbsp;later&nbsp;in&nbsp;your&nbsp;numbered&nbsp;list.<br>
<br>
Also&nbsp;number&nbsp;6&nbsp;contradicts&nbsp;number&nbsp;8&nbsp;where&nbsp;number&nbsp;6&nbsp;would&nbsp;be&nbsp;the&nbsp;most&nbsp;up&nbsp;to&nbsp;date&nbsp;status<br>
on&nbsp;the&nbsp;Oracle&nbsp;port.<br>
<br>
Additional&nbsp;Information:<br>
-----------------------------<br>
1.&nbsp;Comments&nbsp;are&nbsp;now&nbsp;stored&nbsp;in&nbsp;varchar&nbsp;fields&nbsp;of&nbsp;4k&nbsp;in&nbsp;size&nbsp;each.&nbsp;If&nbsp;the&nbsp;comment&nbsp;is&nbsp;more<br>
than&nbsp;4k&nbsp;it&nbsp;is&nbsp;broken&nbsp;up&nbsp;into&nbsp;chunks&nbsp;and&nbsp;given&nbsp;a&nbsp;sort&nbsp;number&nbsp;so&nbsp;each&nbsp;comment&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;re<br>
assembled&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;correct&nbsp;order.&nbsp;This&nbsp;was&nbsp;done&nbsp;because&nbsp;originally&nbsp;I&nbsp;was&nbsp;storing&nbsp;the&nbsp;comments<br>
in&nbsp;a&nbsp;long&nbsp;datatype&nbsp;which&nbsp;unfortunately&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;be&nbsp;indexed&nbsp;or&nbsp;joined&nbsp;with&nbsp;another&nbsp;table.&nbsp;This<br>
cause&nbsp;the&nbsp;search&nbsp;of&nbsp;text&nbsp;within&nbsp;the&nbsp;long&nbsp;description&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;disabled&nbsp;for&nbsp;a&nbsp;long&nbsp;time.&nbsp;That<br>
is&nbsp;now&nbsp;working&nbsp;and&nbsp;is&nbsp;nto&nbsp;showing&nbsp;any&nbsp;noticeble&nbsp;performance&nbsp;hit&nbsp;that&nbsp;I&nbsp;can&nbsp;tell.&nbsp;<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp;Work&nbsp;is&nbsp;being&nbsp;started&nbsp;on&nbsp;internationalizing&nbsp;the&nbsp;Bugzilla&nbsp;source&nbsp;we&nbsp;have&nbsp;to&nbsp;allow&nbsp;our<br>
Japanese&nbsp;customers&nbsp;to&nbsp;enter&nbsp;bug&nbsp;reports&nbsp;into&nbsp;a&nbsp;single&nbsp;bugzilla&nbsp;system.&nbsp;This&nbsp;will&nbsp;probably<br>
be&nbsp;done&nbsp;by&nbsp;using&nbsp;the&nbsp;nvarchar&nbsp;data&nbsp;types&nbsp;supported&nbsp;by&nbsp;Oracle&nbsp;which&nbsp;allows&nbsp;storage&nbsp;of<br>
double&nbsp;byte&nbsp;characters&nbsp;and&nbsp;also&nbsp;the&nbsp;use&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Accept-Language&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;http&nbsp;header&nbsp;for&nbsp;<br>
detection&nbsp;by&nbsp;Bugilla&nbsp;of&nbsp;which&nbsp;language&nbsp;to&nbsp;render.<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp;Of&nbsp;course&nbsp;even&nbsp;more&nbsp;cosmetic&nbsp;changes.&nbsp;It&nbsp;is&nbsp;difficult&nbsp;to&nbsp;keep&nbsp;up&nbsp;with&nbsp;the&nbsp;ever&nbsp;<br>
changing&nbsp;faces&nbsp;of&nbsp;www.redhat.com.<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;convenience&nbsp;enhancements&nbsp;in&nbsp;the&nbsp;administration&nbsp;utilities.&nbsp;And&nbsp;more&nbsp;integration<br>
with&nbsp;other&nbsp;internal/external&nbsp;Red&nbsp;Hat&nbsp;web&nbsp;sites.<br>
<br>

    you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and
    legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front
    cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover.  Both covers must
    also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these
    copies.  The front cover must present the full title with all
    words of the title equally prominent and visible.  You may add
    other material on the covers in addition.  Copying with changes
    limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the
    Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim
    copying in other respects.</P

    computer-network location containing a complete Transparent copy
    of the Document, free of added material, which the general
    network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
    charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you
    begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that
    this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated
