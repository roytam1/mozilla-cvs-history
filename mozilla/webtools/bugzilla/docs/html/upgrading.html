>5.9. Upgrading to New Releases</H1
><P
>A plain Bugzilla is fairly easy to upgrade from one version to a
    newer one. Always read the release notes to see if there are any issues
    that you might need to take note of. It is recommended that you take a 
    backup of your database and your entire Bugzilla installation before attempting an
    upgrade. You can upgrade a 'clean' installation by untarring a new
    tarball over the old installation. If you are upgrading from 2.12 or
    later, and have cvs installed, you can type <TT
CLASS="filename"
>cvs -z3 update</TT
>, 
    and resolve conflicts if there are any.
    </P
><P
>However, things get a bit more complicated if you've made
    changes to Bugzilla's code. In this case, you may have to re-make or
    reapply those changes. One good method is to take a diff of your customized
    version against the original, so you can survey all that you've changed.
    Hopefully, templatization will reduce the need for
    this in the future.</P
><P
>From version 2.8 onward, Bugzilla databases can be automatically
    carried forward during an upgrade. However, because the developers of
    Bugzilla are constantly adding new
    tables, columns and fields, you'll probably get SQL errors if you just
    update the code and attempt to use Bugzilla. Always run the
    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>checksetup.pl</TT
> 
    script whenever you upgrade your installation.</P
><P
>If you are running Bugzilla version 2.8 or lower, and wish to
    upgrade to the latest version, please consult the file,
    "UPGRADING-pre-2.8" in the Bugzilla root directory after untarring the
    archive.</P
