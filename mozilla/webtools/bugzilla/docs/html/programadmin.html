      are the broadest category in Bugzilla, and tend to represent real-world
      shipping products. E.g. if your company makes computer games, 
      you should have one product per game, perhaps a "Common" product for 
      units of technology used in multiple games, and maybe a few special
       products (Website, Administration...)</P
><P
>Many of Bugzilla's settings are configurable on a per-product
      basis. The number of "votes" available to users is set per-product, 
      as is the number of votes
      required to move a bug automatically from the UNCONFIRMED status to the
      NEW status.</P
><P
>To create a new product:</P
><P
></P
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>Select "products" from the footer</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Select the "Add" link in the bottom right</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Enter the name of the product and a description. The
          Description field may contain HTML.</P
></LI
></OL
><P
>Don't worry about the "Closed for bug entry", "Maximum Votes
      per person", "Maximum votes a person can put on a single bug",
      "Number of votes a bug in this Product needs to automatically get out
      of the UNCOMFIRMED state", and "Version" options yet. We'll cover
      those in a few moments.

>5.3.2. Components</H2
><P
>Components are subsections of a Product. E.g. the computer game 
      you are designing may have a "UI"
      component, an "API" component, a "Sound System" component, and a
      "Plugins" component, each overseen by a different programmer. It
      often makes sense to divide Components in Bugzilla according to the
      natural divisions of responsibility within your Product or
      company.</P
><P
>&#13;      Each component has a owner and (if you turned it on in the parameters),
      a QA Contact. The owner should be the primary person who fixes bugs in
      that component. The QA Contact should be the person who will ensure
      these bugs are completely fixed. The Owner, QA Contact, and Reporter
      will get email when new bugs are created in this Component and when
      these bugs change. Default Owner and Default QA Contact fields only
      dictate the 
      <EM
>default assignments</EM
>; 
      these can be changed on bug submission, or at any later point in
      a bug's life.</P
><P
>To create a new Component:</P

></LI
><LI
><P
>Fill out the "Component" field, a short "Description", 
          the "Initial Owner" and "Initial QA Contact" (if enabled.) 
          The Component and Description fields may contain HTML; 
          the "Initial Owner" field must be a login name
          already existing in the database.

      3.1", "Flinders 95", and "Flinders 2000". Version is not a multi-select
      field; the usual practice is to select the most recent version with
      the bug.
