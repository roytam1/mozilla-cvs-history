	This allows developers to gauge user need for a particular enhancement
	or bugfix.  By allowing bugs with a certain number of votes to automatically move from

	attention so they don't sit for a long time awaiting triage.

	      This way, they can have a fix ready before the security vulnerability

	      default, has no members, and only add members to the group (in their individual
	      User page, as described under User Administration) who should have
	      priveleged access to "Security" bugs.  Alternately, you may create a Group

>Note: </B
>	  Groups in Bugzilla are a complicated beast that evolved out of very simple user
	  permission bitmasks, apparently itself derived from common concepts in UNIX access
	  controls.  A "bitmask" is a fixed-length number whose value can describe one, and
	  only one, set of states.  For instance, UNIX file permissions are assigned bitmask
	  values:  "execute" has a value of 1, "write" has a value of 2, 
	  and "read" has a value of 4.  Add them together,
	  and a file can be read, written to, and executed if it has a bitmask of "7". (This
	  is a simplified example -- anybody who knows UNIX security knows there is much
	  more to it than this.  Please bear with me for the purpose of this note.)  The only
	  way a bitmask scheme can work is by doubling the bit count for each value.  Thus
	  if UNIX wanted to offer another file permission, the next would have to be a value of
	  8, then the next 16, the next 32, etc.
	</P
><P
>	  Similarly, Bugzilla offers a bitmask to define group permissions, with an internal
	  limit of 64.  Several are already occupied
	  by built-in permissions.  The way around this limitation is
	  to avoid assigning groups to products if you have many products, avoid bloating
	  of group lists, and religiously prune irrelevant groups.  In reality, most installations
	  of Bugzilla support far fewer than 64 groups, so this limitation has not hit
	  for most sites, but it is on the table to be revised for Bugzilla 3.0
	  because it interferes with the security schemes of some administrators.
