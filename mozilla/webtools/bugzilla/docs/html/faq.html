	    A year has gone by, and I <EM

	    find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
	    other defect-tracking software.  However, from my personal
	    experience with other bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers
	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
	    (free!), more developer- friendly features (such as stored
	    queries, email integration, and platform independence),
	    improved scalability, open source code, greater

	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it.  Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in

	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source

	    The Bugzilla code has undergone a reasonably complete security audit,
      and user-facing CGIs run under Perl's taint mode. However, 
	    it is recommended that you closely examine permissions on your Bugzilla
	    installation, and follow the recommended security guidelines found

	     There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also generally
	    not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what you're doing.
	    However, if you understand SQL you can use the mysqladmin utility to
	    manually insert, delete, and modify table information. Personally, I
	    use "phpMyAdmin". You have to compile a PHP module with MySQL

	    Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.  Synchronization will

	    Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure
