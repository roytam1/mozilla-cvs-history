	    The designated "Maintainer" is Tara Hernandez, with QA support by Matthew Tuck.
	    Dan Mosedale and Dawn Endico are employees of Mozilla.org responsible for the
	    installation of Bugzilla there, and are very frequent code contributors.
	    Terry Weissman originally ported Bugzilla, but "these days, Terry just hangs around
	    and heckles."  The rest of us are mostly transient developers; Bugzilla suits
	    our needs, and we contribute code as we have needs for updates.

>		     I suppose the current thread warrants an update on the status of
		Oracle and bugzilla ;) We have now been running Bugzilla 2.8 on
		Oracle for the last two days in our production environment. I
		tried to do as much testing as possible with it before going live
		which is some of the reason for the long delay. I did not get
		enough feedback as I would have liked from internal developers to
		help weed out any bugs still left so I said "Fine, i will take it
		live and then I will get the feedback I want :)" So it is now
		starting to stabilize and it running quite well after working
		feverishly the last two days fixing problems as soon as they came
		in from the outside world. The current branch in cvs is up2date if
		anyone would like to grab it and try it out. The oracle _setup.pl
		is broken right now due to some last minute changes but I will
		update that soon. Therefore you would probably need to create the
		database tables the old fashioned way using the supplied sql
		creation scripts located in the ./oracle directory. We have heavy
		optimizations in the database it self thanks to the in-house DBA
		here at Red Hat so it is running quite fast. The database itself
		is located on a dual PII450 with 1GB ram and 14 high voltage
		differential raided scsi drives. The tables and indexes are
		partitioned in 4 chuncks across the raided drive which is nice
		because when ever you need to do a full table scan, it is actually
		starting in 4 different locations on 4 different drives
		simultaneously. And the indexes of course are on separate drives
		from the data so that speeds things up tremendously. When  I can
		find the time I will document all that we have done to get this
		thing going to help others that may need it.
	      </P
><P
>		As Matt has mentioned it is still using out-dated code and with a
		little help I would like to bring everything up to date for
		eventual  incorporation with the main cvs tree. Due to other
		duties I have with the company any help with this wiould be
		appreciated. What we are using  now is what I call a best first
		effort. It definitely can be improved on and may even need
		complete rewrites in a lot of areas. A lot of changes may have to
		be made in the way Bugzilla does things currently  to make this
		transition to a more generic database interface.  Fortunately when
		making the Oracle changes I made sure I didn't do  anything that I
		would consider Oracle specific and could not be easily done with
		other databases. Alot of the sql statements need to be broken up
		into smaller utilities that themselves would need to make
		decisions on what database they are using but the majority of the
		code can be made database neutral.

	    reason it hasn't been updated for all your bugs. This is the database
	    against which queries are run, so that really complex or slow queries won't
	    lock up portions of the database for other users. You can turn off the
	    shadow database in editparams.cgi. If you wish to continue using the shadow
	    database, then as your "bugs" user run "./syncshadowdb -syncall" from the
	    command line in the bugzilla installation directory to recreate your shadow
	    database. After it finishes, be sure to check the params and make sure that
	    "queryagainstshadowdb" is still turned on. The syncshadowdb program turns it
	    off if it was on, and is supposed to turn it back on when completed; that
	    way, if it crashes in the middle of recreating the database, it will stay
	    off forever until someone turns it back on by hand. Apparently, it doesn't

	    as adding the "---" priority field to your localconfig file in the appropriate area,
	    re-running checksetup.pl, and then changing the default priority in your browser using
	    "editparams.cgi".  Hmm, now that I think about it, that is kind of a klunky way to handle
	    it, but for now it's what we have!  Although the bug has been closed "resolved wontfix",
	    there may be a better way to handle this...
