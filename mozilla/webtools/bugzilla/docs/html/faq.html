	    We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
	    other defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please
      get in touch. However, from the author's personal
	    experience with other bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers
	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
	    (free!), more developer- friendly features (such as stored
	    queries, email integration, and platform independence),
	    improved scalability, open source code, greater
	    flexibility, and superior ease-of-use.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    If you happen to be a commercial bug-tracker vendor, please
	    step forward with a list of advantages your product has over
      Bugzilla. We'd be happy to include it in the "Competitors"
      section.

	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it. Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in
	    usability, customizability, scalability, and user interface. It
	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source
	    bug-tracking software in existence.

	    You can help the project along by either hacking a patch yourself

            MySQL was originally chosen because it is free, easy to install,
            and was available for the hardware Netscape intended to run it on.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;            There is currently work in progress to make Bugzilla work on
            PostgreSQL and Sybase in the default distribution. You can track
            the progress of these initiatives in <A

            respectively.

            Bugzilla used to have the path to perl on the shebang line set to
            <TT
CLASS="filename"

            Terry first started writing the code for mozilla.org he needed a
            version of Perl and other tools that were completely under his
            control. This location was abandoned for the 2.18 release in favor
            of the more sensible <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/bin/perl</TT
>. If you
            installed an older verion of Bugzilla and created the symlink we
            suggested, you can remove it now (provided that you don't have

            Bugzilla can output buglists as HTML (the default), CSV or RDF.
            The link for CSV can be found at the bottom of the buglist in HTML
            format. This CSV format can easily be imported into MS Excel or
            other spreadsheet applications.
          </P

>&#13;            To use the RDF format of the buglist it is necessary to append a
            <TT
CLASS="computeroutput"
>&#38;ctype=rdf</TT
> to the URL. RDF
            is meant to be machine readable and thus it is assumed that the
            URL would be generated programatically so there is no user visible
            link to this format.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            Currently the only script included with Bugzilla that can import

	    It all depends on your level of commitment. Someone with much Bugzilla
	    experience can get you up and running in less than a day, and
	    your Bugzilla install can run untended for years. If your
	    Bugzilla strategy is critical to your business workflow, hire somebody

	    bug-tracking maintenance &#38; customization.

            Red Hat's old version of Bugzilla (based on 2.8) worked on Oracle,

            Red Hat's newer version (based on 2.17.1 and soon to be merged into
            the main distribution) runs on PostgreSQL. At this time we know of
            no recent ports of Bugzilla to Oracle; to be honest, Bugzilla

	     There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also generally
	    not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what you're doing.
	    However, if you understand SQL you can use the <B
CLASS="command"
>mysql</B
>
            command line utility to manually insert, delete and modify table
            information. There are also more intuitive GUI clients available.
            Personal favorites of the Bugzilla team are <A

	    Try running MySQL from its binary: "mysqld --skip-grant-tables". This
	    will allow you to completely rule out grant tables as the cause of your
            frustration. If this Bugzilla is able to connect at this point then
            you need to check that you have granted proper permission to the user
            password combo defined in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>localconfig</TT
>.

	    Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs. Synchronization will
	    only work one way -- you can create a read-only copy of the database
	    at one site, and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main
	    database.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    MySQL has some synchronization features builtin to the latest releases.
	    It would be great if someone looked into the possibilities there
	    and provided a report to the newsgroup on how to effectively
	    synchronize two Bugzilla installations.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    If you simply need to transfer bugs from one Bugzilla to another,
	    checkout the "move.pl" script in the Bugzilla distribution.

	    Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure
	    the Web server to treat *.cgi files as CGI scripts. In IIS, you do this by
	    adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with the &#60;path&#62;\perl.exe %s %s as the
	    executable.

        The logic flow currently used is RESOLVED, then VERIFIED, then CLOSED.
        You <EM
>can</EM
> mass-CLOSE bugs from the change several
        bugs at once page. <EM
>but</EM
>, every bug listed on the
        page has to be in VERIFIED state before the control to do it will show
        up on the form. You can also mass-VERIFY, but every bug listed has to be
        RESOLVED in order for the control to show up on the form. The logic
        behind this is that if you pick one of the bugs that's not VERIFIED and
        try to CLOSE it, the bug change will fail miserably (thus killing any
        changes in the list after it while doing the bulk change) so it doesn't
        even give you the choice.
