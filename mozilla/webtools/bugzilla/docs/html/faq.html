	    We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
	    other defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please
      get in touch. However, from the author's personal
	    experience with other bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers
	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
	    (free!), more developer- friendly features (such as stored
	    queries, email integration, and platform independence),
	    improved scalability, open source code, greater
	    flexibility, and superior ease-of-use.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    If you happen to be a commercial bug-tracker vendor, please
	    step forward with a list of advantages your product has over
      Bugzilla. We'd be happy to include it in the "Competitors"
      section.

	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it.  Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in
	    usability, customizability, scalability, and user interface.  It
	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source
	    bug-tracking software in existence.
	  </P

>&#13;	    That doesn't mean it can't use improvement!
	    You can help the project along by either hacking a patch yourself

	    Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had outsiders

	    Mozilla allows data export through a custom DTD in XML format.
	    It does not, however, export to specific formats other than the

	    is left as an exercise for the reader.

	    To a certain extent, yes. 2.16's templates mean that you can localise

	    Red Hat Bugzilla works with Oracle.  The current version
	    from Mozilla.org does not have this capability.  Unfortunately, though
	    you will sacrifice a lot of the really great features available in
	    Bugzilla 2.14 and 2.16 if you go with the 2.8-based Redhat version.

	     There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also generally
	    not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what you're doing.
	    However, if you understand SQL you can use the mysqladmin utility to
	    manually insert, delete, and modify table information. Personally, I
	    use "phpMyAdmin". You have to compile a PHP module with MySQL
	    support to make it work, but it's very clean and easy to use.

	    Certain version of MySQL (notably, 3.23.29 and 3.23.30) accidentally disabled

	    Try running MySQL from its binary: "mysqld --skip-grant-tables". This
	    will allow you to completely rule out grant tables as the cause of your

	    Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.  Synchronization will
	    only work one way -- you can create a read-only copy of the database
	    at one site, and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main
	    database.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    MySQL has some synchronization features builtin to the latest releases.
	    It would be great if someone looked into the possibilities there
	    and provided a report to the newsgroup on how to effectively
	    synchronize two Bugzilla installations.
	  </P

>&#13;	    If you simply need to transfer bugs from one Bugzilla to another,

	    Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure

	    adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with the &#60;path&#62;\perl.exe %s %s as the
	    executable.
