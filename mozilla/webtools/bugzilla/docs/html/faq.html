	    A year has gone by, and I <EM

	    find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against

	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
	    (free!), more developer- friendly features (such as stored

	    improved scalability, open source code, greater

	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it.  Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in
	    usability, customizability, scalability, and user interface.  It
	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source
	    bug-tracking software in existence.

	    Red Hat Bugzilla is arguably more user-friendly, customizable, and scalable
	    than stock Bugzilla. Check it out at
	    http://bugzilla.redhat.com and the sources at ftp://people.redhat.com/dkl/.
	    They've set their Bugzilla up to work with Oracle out of the box.
	    Note that Redhat Bugzilla is based upon the 2.8 Bugzilla tree;
	    Bugzilla has made some tremendous advances since the 2.8 release.
	    Why not download both Bugzillas to check out the differences for
	    yourself?

><OL

>&#13;		    No enum types. All old enum types are now separate smaller tables.
		  </P

		    changed to a more generic way of doing this task
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;		    Bug reports can only be altered by the reporter, assignee, or a
		    privileged bugzilla user. The rest of the world can see the bug but in
		    a non-changeable format (unless the bug has been marked private).  They
		    can however add comments, add and remove themselves from the CC list
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;		    Different group scheme. Each group has an id number related to it.
		    There is a user_group table which contains userid to groupid mappings
		    to determine which groups each user belongs to.  Additionally there is
		    a bug_group table that has bugid to groupid mappings to show which
		    groups can see a particular bug. If there are no entries for a bug in
		    this table then the bug is public.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;		    Product groups. product_table created to only allow certain products to
		    be visible for certain groups in both bug entry and query. This was
		    particulary helpful for support contracts.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;		    Of course many (too many) changes to Bugzilla code itself to allow use
		    with Oracle and still allow operation with Mysql if so desired.
		    Currently if you use Mysql it is set to use Mysql's old permission
		    scheme to keep breakage to a minimum. Hopefully one day this will
		    standardize on one style which may of course be something completely
		    different.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;		    Uses Text::Template perl module for rendering of the dynamic HTML pages
		    such as enter_bug.cgi, query.cgi, bug_form.pl, and for the header and
		    footer parts of the page. This allows the html to be separate from the
		    perl code for customizing the look and feel of the page to one's
		    preference.
		  </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>&#13;		    There are many other smaller changes. There is also a port to Oracle
		    that I have been working on as time permits but is not completely
		    finished but somewhat usable. I will merge it into our standard code
		    base when it becomes production quality. Unfortunately there will have
		    to be some conditionals in the code to make it work with other than
		    Oracle due to some differences between Oracle and Mysql.
		  </P
></LI
></OL
><P
>&#13;		Both the Mysql and Oracle versions of our current code base are
		available from ftp://people.redhat.com/dkl. If Terry/Tara wants I can submit
		patch files for all of the changes I have made and he can determine what is

		changes to the actual CVS I will need to back out alot of things that are
		not suitable for the rest of the Bugzilla community. I am open to

>&#13;		     I suppose the current thread warrants an update on the status of
		Oracle and bugzilla ;) We have now been running Bugzilla 2.8 on
		Oracle for the last two days in our production environment. I
		tried to do as much testing as possible with it before going live
		which is some of the reason for the long delay. I did not get
		enough feedback as I would have liked from internal developers to
		help weed out any bugs still left so I said "Fine, i will take it
		live and then I will get the feedback I want :)" So it is now
		starting to stabilize and it running quite well after working
		feverishly the last two days fixing problems as soon as they came
		in from the outside world. The current branch in cvs is up2date if
		anyone would like to grab it and try it out. The oracle _setup.pl
		is broken right now due to some last minute changes but I will
		update that soon. Therefore you would probably need to create the
		database tables the old fashioned way using the supplied sql
		creation scripts located in the ./oracle directory. We have heavy
		optimizations in the database it self thanks to the in-house DBA
		here at Red Hat so it is running quite fast. The database itself
		is located on a dual PII450 with 1GB ram and 14 high voltage
		differential raided scsi drives. The tables and indexes are
		partitioned in 4 chuncks across the raided drive which is nice
		because when ever you need to do a full table scan, it is actually
		starting in 4 different locations on 4 different drives
		simultaneously. And the indexes of course are on separate drives
		from the data so that speeds things up tremendously. When  I can
		find the time I will document all that we have done to get this
		thing going to help others that may need it.
	      </P
><P
>&#13;		As Matt has mentioned it is still using out-dated code and with a
		little help I would like to bring everything up to date for
		eventual  incorporation with the main cvs tree. Due to other
		duties I have with the company any help with this wiould be
		appreciated. What we are using  now is what I call a best first
		effort. It definitely can be improved on and may even need
		complete rewrites in a lot of areas. A lot of changes may have to
		be made in the way Bugzilla does things currently  to make this
		transition to a more generic database interface.  Fortunately when
		making the Oracle changes I made sure I didn't do  anything that I
		would consider Oracle specific and could not be easily done with
		other databases. Alot of the sql statements need to be broken up
		into smaller utilities that themselves would need to make
		decisions on what database they are using but the majority of the
		code can be made database neutral.

Loki has mainted their code, originally a fork from the Bugzilla 2.8 code base, and it is quite a bit different than stock Bugzilla at this point.  I recommend you stick with official Bugzilla version 2.14 rather than using a fork, but it's up to you.

	    Yes.  However, modifying some fields, notably those related to bug

	    The index.html page doesn't show the footer.  It's really annoying to have
	    to go to the querypage just to check my "my bugs" link.  How do I get a footer
	    on static HTML pages?
	  </P

><B

            It's possible to get the footer on the static index page using
            Server Side Includes (SSI).  The trick to doing this is making
            sure that your web server is set up to allow SSI and specifically,
            the #exec directive.  You should also rename <TT
CLASS="filename"
>index.html</TT
>
            to <TT
CLASS="filename"
>index.shtml</TT
>.
          </P
><P
>&#13;            After you've done all that, you can add the following line to
            <TT
CLASS="filename"
>index.shtml</TT
>:

>&#13;            Because this method depends on being able to use a #exec directive,

            You could have a small script (such as <TT
CLASS="filename"
>api.cgi</TT

            that basically looks like:

	    Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had outsiders

	    Mozilla allows data export through a custom DTD in XML format.

	    is left as an exercise for the reader.

	    Red Hat Bugzilla, mentioned above, works with Oracle.  The current version

	    Bugzilla 2.10 and 2.12 if you go with the 2.8-based Redhat version.

	     You've almost certainly enabled the "shadow database", but for some
	    reason it hasn't been updated for all your bugs. This is the database
	    against which queries are run, so that really complex or slow queries won't
	    lock up portions of the database for other users. You can turn off the
	    shadow database in editparams.cgi. If you wish to continue using the shadow
	    database, then as your "bugs" user run "./syncshadowdb -syncall" from the
	    command line in the bugzilla installation directory to recreate your shadow
	    database. After it finishes, be sure to check the params and make sure that
	    "queryagainstshadowdb" is still turned on. The syncshadowdb program turns it
	    off if it was on, and is supposed to turn it back on when completed; that
	    way, if it crashes in the middle of recreating the database, it will stay
	    off forever until someone turns it back on by hand. Apparently, it doesn't
	    always do that yet.

	     There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also generally
	    not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what you're doing.
	    However, if you understand SQL you can use the mysqladmin utility to
	    manually insert, delete, and modify table information. Personally, I
	    use "phpMyAdmin". You have to compile a PHP module with MySQL
	    support to make it work, but it's very clean and easy to use.

	    Certain version of MySQL (notably, 3.23.29 and 3.23.30) accidentally disabled

	    Try running MySQL from its binary: "mysqld --skip-grant-tables". This

	    Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.  Synchronization will
	    only work one way -- you can create a read-only copy of the database
	    at one site, and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main
	    database.
	  </P
><P
>&#13;	    MySQL has some synchronization features builtin to the latest releases.
	    It would be great if someone looked into the possibilities there

	    synchronize two Bugzilla installations.
	  </P

	    The current behavior is acceptable to bugzilla.mozilla.org and most
	    users.  I personally don't like it.  You have your choice of patches
	    to change this behavior, however.

	    Note that these patches are somewhat dated.  You will need to do the find

	    The most likely cause is a very old browser or a browser that is

	    Yup.  Just rename it once you download it, or save it under a different

	    cripple some other functionality.

	    In the Bugzilla administrator UI, edit the keyword and it will let you

	    with the keyword cache.  Run sanitycheck.cgi to fix it.

	    How can I change the default priority to a null value?  For instance, have the default
	    priority be "---" instead of "P2"?
	  </P

CLASS="answer"

	    This is well-documented here: <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49862"
TARGET="_top"
>&#13;	    http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=49862</A
>.  Ultimately, it's as easy
	    as adding the "---" priority field to your localconfig file in the appropriate area,
	    re-running checksetup.pl, and then changing the default priority in your browser using
	    "editparams.cgi".  Hmm, now that I think about it, that is kind of a klunky way to handle
	    it, but for now it's what we have!  Although the bug has been closed "resolved wontfix",
	    there may be a better way to handle this...
