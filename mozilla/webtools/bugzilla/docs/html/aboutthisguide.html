>      This document was started on September 17, 2000
      by Matthew P. Barnson after a great deal of procrastination updating the Bugzilla FAQ,
      which I left untouched for nearly half a year.
      After numerous complete rewrites and reformatting, it is the document you see today.
    </P
><P
>      Despite the lack of updates, Bugzilla is simply the best piece of bug-tracking software
      the world has ever seen.  This document is intended to be the comprehensive guide to 
      the installation, administration, maintenance, and use of the Bugzilla bug-tracking system.
    </P

>      This release of the Bugzilla Guide is the <EM
>2.11</EM
> release.
      It is so named that it may match the current version of Bugzilla.
      The numbering tradition stems from that used for many free software projects,
      in which <EM
>even-numbered</EM
> point releases (1.2, 1.14, etc.)
      are considered "stable releases", intended for public consumption; on the other 
      hand, <EM
>odd-numbered</EM
> point releases (1.3, 2.09, etc.)
      are considered unstable <EM
>development</EM
> releases intended
      for advanced users, systems administrators, developers, and those who enjoy
      a lot of pain. 
    </P
><P
>      Newer revisions of the Bugzilla Guide will follow the numbering conventions of
      the main-tree Bugzilla releases, available at
      <A
HREF="http://www.mozilla.org/bugs/source.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Mozilla.org</A
>, with
      the exception that intermediate releases will have a minor revision number
      following a period.  For instance, if the current version of Bugzilla is 4.2,
      the current "stable" version of the Bugzilla guide, in, say, it's fifth revision,
      would be numbered "4.2.5".  Got it?  Good.
    </P

>      I wrote this in response to the enormous demand for decent Bugzilla documentation.
      I have incorporated instructions from the Bugzilla README, Frequently Asked Questions,
      Database Schema Document, and various mailing lists to create it.
