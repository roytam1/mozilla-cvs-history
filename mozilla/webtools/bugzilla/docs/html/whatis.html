>      Bugzilla is one example of a class of programs called "Defect Tracking Systems",
      or, more commonly, "Bug-Tracking Systems".  Defect Tracking Systems allow individual or
      groups of developers to keep track of outstanding bugs in their product effectively.
      At the time Bugzilla was originally written, as a port from Netscape Communications'
      "Bugsplat!" program to Perl from TCL, there were very few competitors in the market
      for bug-tracking software.  Most commercial defect-tracking software vendors at the
      time charged enormous licensing fees.  Bugzilla quickly became a favorite of the
      open-source crowd (with its genesis in the open-source browser project, Mozilla) and
      is now the de-facto standard defect-tracking system against which all others are
      measured.

>      Despite its current robustness and popularity, however, Bugzilla
      faces some near-term challenges, such as reliance on a single database, a lack of
      abstraction of the user interface and program logic, verbose email bug
      notifications, a powerful but daunting query interface, little reporting configurability,
      problems with extremely large queries, some unsupportable bug resolution options,
      no internationalization, and dependence on some nonstandard libraries.
    </P
><P
>      Despite these small problems, Bugzilla is very hard to beat.  It is under <EM

>
      active development to address the current issues, and a long-awaited overhaul in the form
      of Bugzilla 3.0 is expected sometime later this year.
