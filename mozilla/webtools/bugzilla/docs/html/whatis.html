><P
>      Bugzilla is one example of a class of programs called "Defect
Tracking Systems", or, more commonly, "Bug-Tracking Systems".  Defect
Tracking Systems allow individual or groups of developers to keep
track of outstanding bugs in their product effectively. Bugzilla was
originally written by Terry Weissman in a programming language called
"TCL", to replace a crappy bug-tracking database used internally for
Netscape Communications.  Terry later ported Bugzilla to Perl from
TCL, and in Perl it remains to this day. Most commercial
defect-tracking software vendors at the time charged enormous
licensing fees, and Bugzilla quickly became a favorite of the
open-source crowd (with its genesis in the open-source browser
project, Mozilla).  It is now the de-facto standard defect-tracking
system against which all others are measured.

>      Despite its current robustness and popularity, however, Bugzilla
      faces some near-term challenges, such as reliance on a single database, a lack of
      abstraction of the user interface and program logic, verbose email bug
      notifications, a powerful but daunting query interface, little reporting configurability,
      problems with extremely large queries, some unsupportable bug resolution options,
      no internationalization, and dependence on some nonstandard libraries.
    </P
><P
>      Some recent headway has been made on the query front, however.  If you are using the latest
      version of Bugzilla, you should see a "simple search" form on the default front page of
      your Bugzilla install.  Type in two or three search terms and you should pull up some
      relevant information.  This is also available as "queryhelp.cgi".
    </P
><P
>      Despite these small problems, Bugzilla is very hard to beat.  It is under <EM
>very</EM
>
      active development to address the current issues, and a long-awaited overhaul in the form
      of Bugzilla 3.0 is expected sometime later this year.
