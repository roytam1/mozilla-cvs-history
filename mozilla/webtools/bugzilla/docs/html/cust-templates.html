>&#13;      One of the large changes for 2.16 was the templatisation of the
      entire user-facing UI, using the 
      <A
HREF="http://www.template-toolkit.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Template Toolkit</A
>.
      Administrators can now configure the look and feel of Bugzilla without
      having to edit Perl files or face the nightmare of massive merge
      conflicts when they upgrade to a newer version in the future.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Templatisation also makes localised versions of Bugzilla possible, 
      for the first time. In the future, a Bugzilla installation may
      have templates installed for multiple localisations, and select
      which ones to use based on the user's browser language setting.

NAME="AEN1539">5.7.1. What to Edit</H2
><P
>&#13;        There are two different ways of editing of Bugzilla's templates,
        and which you use depends mainly on how you upgrade Bugzilla. The
        template directory structure is that there's a top level directory,
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template</TT
>, which contains a directory for
        each installed localisation. The default English templates are
        therefore in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>en</TT
>. Underneath that, there
        is the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default</TT
> directory and optionally the 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom</TT
> directory. The <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default</TT
>
        directory contains all the templates shipped with Bugzilla, whereas
        the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom</TT
> directory does not exist at first and
        must be created if you want to use it.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The first method of making customisations is to directly edit the
        templates in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/default</TT
>. This is
        probably the best method for small changes if you are going to use
        the CVS method of upgrading, because if you then execute a
        <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs update</B
>, any template fixes will get
        automagically merged into your modified versions.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        If you use this method, your installation will break if CVS conflicts
        occur.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The other method is to copy the templates into a mirrored directory
        structure under <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/custom</TT
>.  The templates
        in this directory automatically override those in default.  
        This is the technique you
        need to use if you use the overwriting method of upgrade, because
        otherwise your changes will be lost.  This method is also better if
        you are using the CVS method of upgrading and are going to make major
        changes, because it is guaranteed that the contents of this directory
        will not be touched during an upgrade, and you can then decide whether
        to continue using your own templates, or make the effort to merge your
        changes into the new versions by hand.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        If you use this method, your installation may break if incompatible
        changes are made to the template interface.  If such changes are made
        they will be documented in the release notes, provided you are using a
        stable release of Bugzilla.  If you use using unstable code, you will
        need to deal with this one yourself, although if possible the changes
        will be mentioned before they occur in the deprecations section of the
        previous stable release's release notes.

NAME="AEN1558">5.7.2. How To Edit Templates</H2
><P
>&#13;        The syntax of the Template Toolkit language is beyond the scope of
        this guide. It's reasonably easy to pick up by looking at the current 
        templates; or, you can read the manual, available on the
        <A
HREF="http://www.template-toolkit.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Template Toolkit home
        page</A
>. However, you should particularly remember (for security
        reasons) to always HTML filter things which come from the database or
        user input, to prevent cross-site scripting attacks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        However, one thing you should take particular care about is the need
        to properly HTML filter data that has been passed into the template.
        This means that if the data can possibly contain special HTML characters
        such as &#60;, and the data was not intended to be HTML, they need to be
        converted to entity form, ie &#38;lt;.  You use the 'html' filter in the
        Template Toolkit to do this.  If you fail to do this, you may open up
        your installation to cross-site scripting attacks.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Also note that Bugzilla adds a few filters of its own, that are not
        in standard Template Toolkit.  In particular, the 'url_quote' filter
        can convert characters that are illegal or have special meaning in URLs,
        such as &#38;, to the encoded form, ie %26.  This actually encodes most
        characters (but not the common ones such as letters and numbers and so
        on), including the HTML-special characters, so there's never a need to
        HTML filter afterwards.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Editing templates is a good way of doing a "poor man's custom fields".
        For example, if you don't use the Status Whiteboard, but want to have
        a free-form text entry box for "Build Identifier", then you can just
        edit the templates to change the field labels. It's still be called
        status_whiteboard internally, but your users don't need to know that.

NAME="AEN1568">5.7.3. Template Formats</H2
><P
>&#13;        Some CGIs have the ability to use more than one template. For
        example, buglist.cgi can output bug lists as RDF or two
        different forms of HTML (complex and simple). (Try this out
        by appending <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#38;format=simple</TT
> to a buglist.cgi
        URL on your Bugzilla installation.) This
        mechanism, called template 'formats', is extensible.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To see if a CGI supports multiple output formats, grep the
        CGI for "ValidateOutputFormat". If it's not present, adding
        multiple format support isn't too hard - see how it's done in
        other CGIs.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To make a new format template for a CGI which supports this, 
        open a current template for
        that CGI and take note of the INTERFACE comment (if present.) This 
        comment defines what variables are passed into this template. If 
        there isn't one, I'm afraid you'll have to read the template and
        the code to find out what information you get. 
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Write your template in whatever markup or text style is appropriate.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        You now need to decide what content type you want your template
        served as. Open up the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>localconfig</TT
> file and find the 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>$contenttypes</TT
>
        variable. If your content type is not there, add it. Remember
        the three- or four-letter tag assigned to you content type. 
        This tag will be part of the template filename.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Save the template as <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#60;stubname&#62;-&#60;formatname&#62;.&#60;contenttypetag&#62;.tmpl</TT
>. 
        Try out the template by calling the CGI as 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#60;cginame&#62;.cgi?format=&#60;formatname&#62;</TT

>&#13;        There are a few templates you may be particularly interested in
        customising for your installation.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>index.html.tmpl</B
>:
        This is the Bugzilla front page.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>global/header.html.tmpl</B
>:
        This defines the header that goes on all Bugzilla pages.
        The header includes the banner, which is what appears to users
        and is probably what you want to edit instead.  However the
        header also includes the HTML HEAD section, so you could for
        example add a stylesheet or META tag by editing the header.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>global/banner.html.tmpl</B
>:
        This contains the "banner", the part of the header that appears
        at the top of all Bugzilla pages.  The default banner is reasonably
        barren, so you'll probably want to customise this to give your
        installation a distinctive look and feel.  It is recommended you
        preserve the Bugzilla version number in some form so the version 
        you are running can be determined, and users know what docs to read.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>global/footer.html.tmpl</B
>:
        This defines the footer that goes on all Bugzilla pages.  Editing
        this is another way to quickly get a distinctive look and feel for
        your Bugzilla installation.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>bug/create/user-message.html.tmpl</B
>:
        This is a message that appears near the top of the bug reporting page.
        By modifying this, you can tell your users how they should report
        bugs.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>bug/create/create.html.tmpl</B
> and
        <B
CLASS="command"
>bug/create/comment.txt.tmpl</B
>:
        You may wish to get bug submitters to give certain bits of structured
        information, each in a separate input widget, for which there is not a
        field in the database. The bug entry system has been designed in an
        extensible fashion to enable you to define arbitrary fields and widgets,
        and have their values appear formatted in the initial
        Description, rather than in database fields. An example of this
        is the mozilla.org 
        <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?format=guided"
TARGET="_top"
>guided 
        bug submission form</A
>.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To make this work, create a custom template for 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>enter_bug.cgi</TT
> (the default template, on which you
        could base it, is <TT
CLASS="filename"
>create.html.tmpl</TT
>),
        and either call it <TT
CLASS="filename"
>create.html.tmpl</TT
> or use a format and
        call it <TT
CLASS="filename"
>create-&#60;formatname&#62;.html.tmpl</TT
>.
        Put it in the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom/bug/create</TT
>
        directory. In it, add widgets for each piece of information you'd like
        collected - such as a build number, or set of steps to reproduce.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Then, create a template like 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom/bug/create/comment.txt.tmpl</TT
>, also named
        after your format if you are using one, which
        references the form fields you have created. When a bug report is
        submitted, the initial comment attached to the bug report will be
        formatted according to the layout of this template.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        For example, if your enter_bug template had a field
        <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>&#60;input type="text" name="buildid" size="30"&#62;</PRE
></FONT
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
        and then your comment.txt.tmpl had
        <TABLE
BORDER="0"
BGCOLOR="#E0E0E0"
WIDTH="100%"
><TR
><TD
><FONT
COLOR="#000000"
><PRE
