><P
>&#13;      One of the large changes for 2.16 was the templatisation of the
      entire user-facing UI, using the 
      <A
HREF="http://www.template-toolkit.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Template Toolkit</A
>.
      Administrators can now configure the look and feel of Bugzilla without
      having to edit Perl files or face the nightmare of massive merge
      conflicts when they upgrade to a newer version in the future.
    </P
><P
>&#13;      Templatisation also makes localised versions of Bugzilla possible, 
      for the first time. In the future, a Bugzilla installation may
      have templates installed for multiple localisations, and select
      which ones to use based on the user's browser language setting.

NAME="AEN1611">5.7.1. What to Edit</H2
><P
>&#13;        There are several ways to take advantage of Bugzilla's templates,
        and which you use depends on what you want to do. The Bugzilla
        template directory structure is that there's a top level directory,
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template</TT
>, which contains a directory for
        each installed localisation. The default English templates are
        therefore in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>en</TT
>. Underneath that, there
        are two directories - <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default</TT
> and 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>custom</TT
>. The <TT
CLASS="filename"
>default</TT
>
        directory contains all the templates shipped with Bugzilla.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        One method of making customisations is to directly edit the templates
        in <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/default</TT
>. This is probably the
        best method for small changes, because if you then execute a
        <B
CLASS="command"
>cvs update</B
>, any template fixes will get
        automagically merged into your modified versions.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The other method is to copy the templates into 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>template/en/custom</TT
>. This method is better if
        you are going to make major changes, because it is guaranteed that
        the contents of this directory will not be touched during an upgrade,
        and you can then decide whether to continue using your own templates,
        or make the effort to merge your changes into the new versions by
        hand.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        The syntax of the Template Toolkit language is beyond the scope of
        this guide. It's reasonably easy to pick up by looking at the current 
        templates; or, you can read the manual, available on the
        <A
HREF="http://www.template-toolkit.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Template Toolkit home
        page </A
>.

><P
>&#13;        There are a few templates you may be particularly interested in
        customising for your installation.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        <B
CLASS="command"
>global/header.html.tmpl</B
> and
        <B
CLASS="command"
>global/footer.html.tmpl</B
>:
        These define the header and footer that go on all Bugzilla pages.
        Editing these is a way to quickly get a distinctive look and
        feel for your Bugzilla installation.

NAME="AEN1632">5.7.3. Template Formats</H2
><P
>&#13;        Some CGIs have the ability to use more than one template. For
        example, buglist.cgi can output bug lists as RDF or two
        different forms of HTML (complex and simple). (Try this out
        by appending <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#38;format=simple</TT
> to a buglist.cgi
        URL on your Bugzilla installation.) This
        mechanism, called template 'formats', is extensible.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To see if a CGI supports multiple output formats, grep the
        CGI for "ValidateOutputFormat". If it's not present, adding
        multiple format support isn't too hard - see how it's done in
        other CGIs.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        To make a new format template for a CGI which supports this, 
        open a current template for
        that CGI and take note of the INTERFACE comment (if present.) This 
        comment defines what variables are passed into this template. If 
        there isn't one, I'm afraid you'll have to read the template and
        the code to find out what information you get. 
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Write your template in whatever markup or text style is appropriate.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        You now need to decide what content type you want your template
        served as. Open up the localconfig file and find the $contenttypes
        variable. If your content type is not there, add it. Remember
        the three- or four-letter tag assigned to you content type. 
        This tag will be part of the template filename.
      </P
><P
>&#13;        Save the template as <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#60;stubname&#62;-&#60;formatname&#62;.&#60;contenttypetag&#62;.tmpl</TT
>. 
        Try out the template by calling the CGI as 
        <TT
CLASS="filename"
>&#60;cginame&#62;.cgi?format=&#60;formatname&#62;</TT
> .
