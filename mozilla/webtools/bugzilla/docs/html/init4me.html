>&#13;      Customized User Preferences offer tremendous versatility to your

      footer of each page once you have logged in to <A

>"Advanced Email Filtering Options"</SPAN

	  in fact, the standard email filter set.  All of them are
	  self-explanatory, but you can use the filters in interesting
	  ways.  For instance, some people (notably Quality Assurance
	  personnel) often only care to receive updates regarding a
	  bug when the bug changes state, so they can track bugs on
	  their flow charts and know when it is time to pull the bug
	  onto a quality assurance platform for inspection.  Other
	  people set up email gateways to

HREF="tinderbox.html"

>By default, the "My Bugs" link appears at the bottom of

	  the most common uses for this page is to remove the "My
	  Bugs" link, replacing it with two other queries, commonly
	  called "My Bug Reports" and "My Bugs" (but only referencing
	  bugs assigned to you).  This allows you to distinguish those
	  bugs you have reported from those you are assigned.  I
	  commonly set up complex Boolean queries in the Query page
	  and link them to my footer in this page.  When they are
	  significantly complex, a one-click reference can save hours
	  of work.</P
