><P
>      After installation, follow the checklist below to ensure that
      you have a successful installation.
      If you do not see a recommended setting for a parameter,
      consider leaving it at the default
      while you perform your initial tests on your Bugzilla setup.
    </P
><DIV
CLASS="PROCEDURE"
><OL
TYPE="1"
><LI
><P
>	  Set "maintainer" to <EM
>your</EM
> email address.
	  This allows Bugzilla's error messages
	  to display your email
	  address and allow people to contact you for help.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Set "urlbase" to the URL reference for your Bugzilla installation.
	  If your bugzilla query page is at http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/query.cgi,
	  your url base is http://www.foo.com/bugzilla/
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Set "usebuggroups" to "1" <EM
>only</EM
>
	  if you need to restrict access to products.
	  I suggest leaving this parameter <EM
>off</EM
>
	  while initially testing your Bugzilla.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Set "usebuggroupsentry" to "1" if you want to be able to restrict access to products.
	  Once again, if you are simply testing your installation, I suggest against
	  turning this parameter on; the strict security checking may stop you from
	  being able to modify your new entries.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Set "shadowdb" to "bug_shadowdb" if you will be
	  running a *very* large installation of Bugzilla.
	  The shadow database enables many simultaneous users
	  to read and write to the database
	  without interfering with one another.  
	  <DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="NOTE"
><P
><B
>Note: </B
>	      Enabling "shadowdb" can adversely affect the stability
	      of your installation of Bugzilla.
	      You may frequently need to manually synchronize your databases,
	      or schedule nightly syncs
	      via "cron"
	    </P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></DIV
>
	  Once again, in testing you should
	  avoid this option -- use it if or when you <EM
>need</EM
> to use it, and have
	  repeatedly run into the problem it was designed to solve -- very long wait times while
	  attempting to commit a change to the database.
        </P
><P
>	  If you use the "shadowdb" option, it is only natural that you should turn the "queryagainstshadowdb"
	  option "On" as well.  Otherwise you are replicating data into a shadow database for no reason!
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  If you have custom logos or HTML you must put in place to fit within your site design guidelines,
	  place the code in the "headerhtml", "footerhtml", "errorhtml", "bannerhtml", or "blurbhtml" text boxes.
	  <DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="NOTE"
><P
><B
>Note: </B
>	      The "headerhtml" text box is the HTML printed out <EM
>before</EM
> any other code on the page.
	      If you have a special banner, put the code for it in "bannerhtml".  You may want to leave these
	      settings at the defaults initially.
	    </P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></DIV

	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Add any text you wish to the "passwordmail" parameter box.  For instance,
	  many people choose to use this box to give a quick training blurb about how to
	  use Bugzilla at your site.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Set "newemailtech" to "on".  Your users will thank you.  This is the default in the post-2.12 world.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Do you want to use the qa contact ("useqacontact") and status whiteboard ("usestatuswhiteboard") fields?
	  These fields are useful because they allow for more flexibility, particularly when you have an existing
	  Quality Assurance and/or Release Engineering team, 
	  but they may not be needed for smaller installations.
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Set "whinedays" to the amount of days you want to let bugs go in the "New" or "Reopened" state before
	  notifying people they have untouched new bugs.  If you do not plan to use this feature, simply do
	  not set up the whining cron job described in the README, or set this value to "0".
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Set the "commenton" options according to your site policy.  It is a wise idea to require comments when users
	  resolve, reassign, or reopen bugs.
	  <DIV
CLASS="NOTE"
><BLOCKQUOTE
CLASS="NOTE"
><P
><B
>Note: </B
>	      It is generally far better to require a developer comment when resolving bugs than not.
	      Few things are more annoying to bug database users than having a developer
	      mark a bug "fixed" without any comment as to what the fix was (or even that it was truly fixed!)
	    </P
></BLOCKQUOTE
></DIV
>
	</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Set "supportwatchers" to "On".  This feature is helpful for team leads to monitor progress in their
	  respective areas, and can offer many other benefits, such as allowing a developer to pick up a
	  former engineer's bugs without requiring her to change all the information in the bug.
