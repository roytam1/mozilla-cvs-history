>&#13;      After installation, follow the checklist below to help ensure
      that you have a successful installation. If you do not see a
      recommended setting for a parameter, consider leaving it at the
      default while you perform your initial tests on your Bugzilla
      setup.

><LI
><P
>The <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

	  bug.</P
><P
>&#13;	  Set "usebuggroups" to "on" <EM
>only</EM

><P
>&#13;	  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

	  <SPAN

	  groupmask when submitted.  This parameter is made for those
	  installations where product isolation is a necessity.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Set "usebuggroupsentry" to "on" if you absolutely need to
	  restrict access to bugs from the moment they are submitted
	  through resolution. Once again, if you are simply testing
	  your installation, I suggest against turning this parameter
	  on; the strict security checking may stop you from being
	  able to modify your new entries.

><P
>&#13;	  You run into an interesting problem when Bugzilla reaches a
	  high level of continuous activity.  MySQL supports only
	  table-level write locking.  What this means is that if
	  someone needs to make a change to a bug, they will lock the
	  entire table until the operation is complete.  Locking for
	  write also blocks reads until the write is complete.  The
	  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"shadowdb"</SPAN
> parameter was designed to get around
	  this limitation.  While only a single user is allowed to
	  write to a table at a time, reads can continue unimpeded on
	  a read-only shadow copy of the database.  Although your
	  database size will double, a shadow database can cause an
	  enormous performance improvement when implemented on
	  extremely high-traffic Bugzilla databases.
	</P
><P
>&#13;	  Set "shadowdb" to "bug_shadowdb" if you will be running a
	  *very* large installation of Bugzilla. The shadow database
	  enables many simultaneous users to read and write to the
	  database without interfering with one another.

>&#13;	      Enabling "shadowdb" can adversely affect the stability
	      of your installation of Bugzilla. You should regularly
	      check that your database is in sync.  It is often
	      advisable to force a shadow database sync nightly via
	      <SPAN

> Once again, in testing you should avoid this option

	  to solve -- very long wait times while attempting to commit
	  a change to the database.  Mozilla.org began needing
	  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"

> when they reached around 40,000
	  Bugzilla users with several hundred Bugzilla bug changes and
	  comments per day.
        </P
><P
>&#13;	  If you use the "shadowdb" option, it is only natural that
	  you should turn the "queryagainstshadowdb" option "On" as
	  well.  Otherwise you are replicating data into a shadow
	  database for no reason!

	  some trait in common.  Many people will put <SPAN

	  fields are useful because they allow for more flexibility,

	  and/or Release Engineering team,  but they may not be needed

>&#13;	      It is generally far better to require a developer

>The <SPAN

	  user.  By enabling this option, you allow users to receive
	  email updates whenever other users receive email updates.
	  This is, of course, subject to the groupset restrictions on
	  the bug; if the <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"watcher"</SPAN
> would not normally be
	  allowed to view a bug, the watcher cannot get around the
	  system by setting herself up to watch the bugs of someone

	  view.</P
><P
>For Bugzilla sites which require strong inter-Product

	  idea.</P
><P
>&#13;	  However, for most sites you should set
	  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"supportwatchers"</SPAN
> to "On".  This feature is
	  helpful for team leads to monitor progress in their
	  respective areas, and can offer many other benefits, such as
	  allowing a developer to pick up a former engineer's bugs
	  without requiring her to change all the information in the
	  bug.
