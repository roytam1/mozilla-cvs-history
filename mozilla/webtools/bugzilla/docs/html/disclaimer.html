      installing Bugzilla and at regular intervals thereafter.  Heaven knows

>      Bugzilla has not undergone a complete security review.
      Security holes probably exist in the code.
      Great care should be taken both in the installation and usage of this software.
      Carefully consider the implications of installing other network services with Bugzilla.
