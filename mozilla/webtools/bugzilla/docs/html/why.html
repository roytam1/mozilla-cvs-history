>      For many years, defect-tracking software has remained principally the domain
      of large software development houses.  Even then, most shops never bothered
      with bug-tracking software, and instead simply relied on shared lists and
      email to monitor the status of defects.  This procedure is error-prone and
      tends to cause those bugs judged least significant by developers to be
      dropped or ignored
    </P
><P
>      These days, many companies are finding that integrated defect-tracking
      systems reduce downtime, increase productivity, and raise customer 
      satisfaction with their systems.  Along with full disclosure, an open
      bug-tracker allows manufacturers to keep in touch with their clients
      and resellers, to communicate about problems effectively throughout
      the data management chain.  Many corporations have also discovered that
      defect-tracking helps reduce costs by providing IT support accountability,
      telephone support knowledge bases, and a common, well-understood system
      for accounting for unusual system or software issues.

>      But why should <EM

    </P
><P
>      Bugzilla is very adaptable to various situations.  Known uses currently
      include IT support queues, Systems Administration deployment management,
      chip design and development problem tracking (both pre-and-post fabrication),
      and software and hardware bug tracking for luminaries such as Redhat, Loki software,
      Linux-Mandrake, and VA Systems.  Combined with systems such as CVS, Bonsai,
      or Perforce SCM, Bugzilla provides a powerful, easy-to-use  solution to
      configuration management and replication problems
    </P
><P
>      Bugzilla can dramatically increase the productivity and accountability
      of individual employees by providing a documented workflow and positive
      feedback for good performance.  How many times do you wake up in the
      morning, remembering that you were supposed to do *something* today,
      but you just can't quite remember?  Put it in Bugzilla, and you have a record
      of it from which you can extrapolate milestones, predict product versions
      for integration, and by using Bugzilla's e-mail integration features
      be able to follow the discussion trail that led to critical decisions.
    </P
><P
>      Ultimately, Bugzilla puts the power in your hands to improve your value
      to your employer or business while providing a usable framework for your natural
      attention to detail and knowledge store to flourish.
