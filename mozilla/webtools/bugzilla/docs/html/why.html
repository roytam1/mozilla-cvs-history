>2.2. Why Should We Use Bugzilla?</H1
><P
>For many years, defect-tracking software has remained principally
    the domain of large software development houses. Even then, most shops
    never bothered with bug-tracking software, and instead simply relied on
    shared lists and email to monitor the status of defects. This procedure
    is error-prone and tends to cause those bugs judged least significant by
    developers to be dropped or ignored.</P
><P
>These days, many companies are finding that integrated
    defect-tracking systems reduce downtime, increase productivity, and raise
    customer satisfaction with their systems. Along with full disclosure, an
    open bug-tracker allows manufacturers to keep in touch with their clients
    and resellers, to communicate about problems effectively throughout the
    data management chain. Many corporations have also discovered that
    defect-tracking helps reduce costs by providing IT support
    accountability, telephone support knowledge bases, and a common,
    well-understood system for accounting for unusual system or software
    issues.</P
><P
>But why should 
    <EM
>you</EM
>

    use Bugzilla?</P
><P
>Bugzilla is very adaptable to various situations. Known uses
    currently include IT support queues, Systems Administration deployment
    management, chip design and development problem tracking (both
    pre-and-post fabrication), and software and hardware bug tracking for
    luminaries such as Redhat, NASA, Linux-Mandrake, and VA Systems.
    Combined with systems such as

    provides a powerful, easy-to-use solution to configuration management and
    replication problems.</P
><P
>Bugzilla can dramatically increase the productivity and
    accountability of individual employees by providing a documented workflow
    and positive feedback for good performance. How many times do you wake up
    in the morning, remembering that you were supposed to do 
    <EM
>something</EM
>
    today, but you just can't quite remember? Put it in Bugzilla, and you
    have a record of it from which you can extrapolate milestones, predict
    product versions for integration, and  follow the discussion trail 
    that led to critical decisions.</P
><P
>Ultimately, Bugzilla puts the power in your hands to improve your
    value to your employer or business while providing a usable framework for
    your natural attention to detail and knowledge store to flourish.</P
