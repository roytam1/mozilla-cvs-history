    which you are welcome to play with (if it's up.) 
    However, it does not necessarily
    have all Bugzilla features enabled, and often runs cutting-edge versions
    of Bugzilla for testing, so some things may work slightly differently

          Bugs are divided up by Product and Component, with a Product
          having one or more Components in it. For example,
          bugzilla.mozilla.org's "Bugzilla" Product is composed of several
          Components:

          These define exactly what state the bug is in - from not even
          being confirmed as a bug, through to being fixed and the fix
          confirmed by Quality Assurance. The different possible values for

          The administrator can define keywords which you can use to tag and

          The "Version" field is usually used for versions of a product which

>Severity:</EM

          This indicates how severe the problem is - from blocker
          ("application unusable") to trivial ("minor cosmetic issue"). You
          can also use this field to indicate whether a bug is an enhancement
          request.</P

          (a.k.a. Target Milestone) A future version by which the bug is to
          be fixed. e.g. The Bugzilla Project's milestones for future
          Bugzilla versions are 2.18, 2.20, 3.0, etc. Milestones are not
          restricted to numbers, thought - you can use any text strings, such
          as dates.</P

      While some of the advice is Mozilla-specific, the basic principles of
      reporting Reproducible, Specific bugs, isolating the Product you are
      using, the Version of the Product, the Component which failed, the
      Hardware Platform, and Operating System you were using at the time of
      the failure go a long way toward ensuring accurate, responsible fixes
      for the bug that bit you.</P
