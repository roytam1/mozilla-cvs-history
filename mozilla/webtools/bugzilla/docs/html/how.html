      A bug passes through several Statuses in its lifetime, and ends up in the

      The "Version" field is usually used for versions of a product which have

      have the particular problem the bug report is about.

	    (a.k.a. Target Milestone) A future version by which the bug is to be
      fixed. e.g. The Bugzilla Project's milestones for future
	    Bugzilla versions are 2.18, 2.20, 3.0, etc. Milestones are 
      not restricted to numbers, thought - you can use any text strings,

      If this bug cannot be fixed unless other bugs are fixed (depends on), or

While some of the advice is Mozilla-specific, the basic principles of reporting Reproducible, Specific bugs, isolating the Product you are using, the Version of the Product, the Component which failed, the Hardware Platform, and Operating System you were using at the time of the failure go a long way toward ensuring accurate, responsible fixes for the bug that bit you.
