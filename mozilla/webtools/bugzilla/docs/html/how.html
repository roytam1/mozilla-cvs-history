      Although Landfill serves as a great introduction to Bugzilla, it does not offer
      all the options you would have as a user on your own installation of Bugzilla,
      nor can it do more than serve as a general introduction to Bugzilla.  Additionally,
      Landfill often runs cutting-edge versions of Bugzilla for testing, so some things
      may work slightly differently than mentioned here.

		  small bug-fix releases on subsequent tenths of a digit.  In most cases, it's not
		  a decimal number; for instance, often 1.9 is an <EM

>	    A "Milestone", or "Target Milestone" is a often a planned future "Version" of a
	    product.  In many cases, though, Milestones simply represent significant dates for
	    a developer.  Having certain features in your Product is frequently
	    tied to revenue (money)
	    the developer will receive if the features work by the time she 
	    reaches the Target Milestone.
	    Target Milestones are a great tool to organize your time.
	    If someone will pay you $100,000 for
	    incorporating certain features by a certain date,
	    those features by that Milestone date become
	    a very high priority.  Milestones tend to be highly malleable creatures,
	    though, that appear
	    to be in reach but are out of reach by the time the important day arrives.

>	    The Bugzilla Project has set up Milestones for future 
	    Bugzilla versions 2.14, 2.16, 2.18, 3.0, etc.  However,

	    code name, or weird alphanumeric
	    combination, like "M19".

	      "Accept bug (change status to ASSIGNED)", fix it, and then resolve.
	      But in this case, we're
	      going to short-circuit the process because this wasn't a real bug.
	      Change the dropdown next to
	      "Resolve Bug" to "INVALID", make sure the radio button is
	      marked next to "Resolve Bug", then
	      click "Commit".

>	      Hey!  It said it couldn't take the change in a big red box!
	      That's right, you must specify
	      a Comment in order to make this change.  Select the "Back"
	      button in your browser, add a
	      Comment, then try Resolving the bug with INVALID status again.
	      This time it should work.

>	  You have now learned the basics of Bugzilla navigation,
	  entering a bug, and bug maintenance.
	  I encourage you to explore these features, and see what you can do with them!
	  We'll spend no more time on individual Bugs or Queries from this point on, so you are
	  on your own there.
	</P
><P
>	  But I'll give a few last hints!
	</P
><P
>	  There is a <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/help.html"
TARGET="_top"
>CLUE</A
>
	  on the Query page
	  that will teach you more how to use the form.
	</P
><P
>	  If you click the hyperlink on the
	  <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi"
TARGET="_top"
>Component</A
>
	  box of the Query page, you will be presented a form that will describe what all
	  the components are.
	</P
><P
>	  Possibly the most powerful feature of the Query page is the 
	  <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/booleanchart.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Boolean Chart</A
> section.
	  It's a bit confusing to use the first time, but can provide unparalleled
	  flexibility in your queries,
	  allowing you to build extremely powerful requests.
	</P
><P
>	  Finally, you can build some nifty 
	  <A
HREF="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/reports.cgi"
TARGET="_top"
>Reports</A
>
	  using the "Bug Reports" link near the bottom of the query page, and also
	  available via the "Reports" link
	  at the footer of each page.
