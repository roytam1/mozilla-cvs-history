>&#13;	    Apache web server, and other NCSA-compliant web servers,
	    observe the convention of using files in directories
	    called <TT

>.htaccess</TT
> files.  These
	    restrict parameters of the web server.  In Bugzilla, they
	    are used to restrict access to certain files which would
	    otherwise compromise your installation.  For instance, the
	    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>localconfig</TT
> file contains the
	    password to your database.  If this information were
	    generally available, and remote access to your database
	    turned on, you risk corruption of your database by
