      Naming of particular products or brands should not be seen as
      endorsements, with the exception of the term "GNU/Linux".  We
      wholeheartedly endorse the use of GNU/Linux in every situation
      where it is appropriate.  It is an extremely versatile, stable,
      and robust operating system that offers an ideal operating
      environment for Bugzilla.
    </para>
    <para>
      You are strongly recommended to make a backup of your system
      before installing Bugzilla and at regular intervals thereafter.
      If you implement any suggestion in this Guide, implement this one!

    <para>
      Although the Bugzilla development team has taken great care to
      ensure that all easily-exploitable bugs or options are
      documented or fixed in the code, security holes surely exist.
      Great care should be taken both in the installation and usage of
      this software. Carefully consider the implications of installing
      other network services with Bugzilla.  The Bugzilla development
      team members, Netscape Communications, America Online Inc., and
      any affiliated developers or sponsors assume no liability for
      your use of this product.  You have the source code to this
      product, and are responsible for auditing it yourself to ensure
      your security needs are met.
