    <title>Purpose and Scope of this Guide</title>
    <para>
      This document was started on September 17, 2000 by Matthew P.
      Barnson after a great deal of procrastination updating the
      Bugzilla FAQ, which I left untouched for nearly half a year.
      After numerous complete rewrites and reformatting, it is the
      document you see today.
    </para>
    <para>
      Bugzilla is simply the best piece of bug-tracking software the
      world has ever seen.  This document is intended to be the
      comprehensive guide to  the installation, administration,
      maintenance, and use of the Bugzilla bug-tracking system.
    </para>
    <para>
      This release of the Bugzilla Guide is the
      <emphasis>&bzg-ver;</emphasis> release. It is so named that it
      may match the current version of Bugzilla. The numbering
      tradition stems from that used for many free software projects,
      in which <emphasis>even-numbered</emphasis> point releases (1.2,
      1.14, etc.) are considered "stable releases", intended for
      public consumption; on the other  hand,
      <emphasis>odd-numbered</emphasis> point releases (1.3, 2.09,
      etc.) are considered unstable <emphasis>development</emphasis>
      releases intended for advanced users, systems administrators,
      developers, and those who enjoy a lot of pain. 
    </para>
    <para>
      Newer revisions of the Bugzilla Guide follow the numbering
      conventions of the main-tree Bugzilla releases, available at
      <ulink url="&bz;">&bz;</ulink>.  Intermediate releases will have
      a minor revision number following a period.  The current version
      of Bugzilla, as of this writing (&bzg-date;) is &bz-ver;; if
      something were seriously wrong with that edition of the Guide,
      subsequent releases would receive an additional dotted-decimal
      digit to indicate the update (&bzg-ver;.1, &bzg-ver;.2, etc.).
      Got it?  Good.
    </para>
    <para>
      I wrote this in response to the enormous demand for decent
      Bugzilla documentation. I have incorporated instructions from
      the Bugzilla README, Frequently Asked Questions, Database Schema
      Document, and various mailing lists to create it. Chances are,
      there are glaring errors in this documentation; please contact
      &bzg-auth-email; to correct them.

      No liability for the contents of this document can be accepted.
      Use the concepts, examples, and other content at your own risk.
      As this is a new edition of this document, there may be errors
      and inaccuracies that may damage your system.  Use of this
      document may cause your girlfriend to leave you, your cats to
      pee on your furniture and clothing, your computer to cease
      functioning, your boss to fire you, and global thermonuclear
      war.  Proceed with caution.

    <para>
      Naming of particular products or brands should not be seen as
      endorsements, with the exception of the term "GNU/Linux".  I
      wholeheartedly endorse the use of GNU/Linux in every situation
      where it is appropriate.  It is an extremely versatile, stable,
      and robust operating system that offers an ideal operating
      environment for Bugzilla.
    </para>
    <para>
      You are strongly recommended to make a backup of your system
      before installing Bugzilla and at regular intervals thereafter.
      Heaven knows it's saved my bacon time after time; if you
      implement any suggestion in  this Guide, implement this one!
    </para>
    <para>
      Although the Bugzilla development team has taken great care to
      ensure that all easily-exploitable bugs or options are
      documented or fixed in the code, security holes surely exist.
      Great care should be taken both in the installation and usage of
      this software. Carefully consider the implications of installing
      other network services with Bugzilla.  The Bugzilla development
      team members, Netscape Communications, America Online Inc., and
      any affiliated developers or sponsors assume no liability for
      your use of this product.  You have the source code to this
      product, and are responsible for auditing it yourself to insure
      your security needs are met.
