      Naming of particular products or brands should not be seen as

      Although the Bugzilla development team has taken great care to
      ensure that all exploitable bugs have been fixed, security holes surely 
      exist in any piece of code. Great care should be taken both in 
      the installation and usage of this software. The Bugzilla development
      team members assume no liability for your use of Bugzilla. You have 
      the source code, and are responsible for auditing it yourself to ensure
      your security needs are met.
