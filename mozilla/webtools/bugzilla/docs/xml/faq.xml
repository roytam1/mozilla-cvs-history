	<answer>
	  <para>
	    A

	<question id="faq-general-compare">
	  <para>
	    How does Bugzilla stack up against other bug-tracking databases?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    We can't find any head-to-head comparisons of Bugzilla against
	    other defect-tracking software. If you know of one, please
      get in touch. However, from the author's personal
	    experience with other bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers
	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price
	    (free!), more developer- friendly features (such as stored
	    queries, email integration, and platform independence),
	    improved scalability, open source code, greater
	    flexibility, and superior ease-of-use.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you happen to be a commercial bug-tracker vendor, please
	    step forward with a list of advantages your product has over
      Bugzilla. We'd be happy to include it in the "Competitors"
      section.

	<question id="faq-general-bzmissing">
	  <para>
	    Why doesn't Bugzilla offer this or that feature or compatibility
	    with this other tracking software?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it.  Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in
	    usability, customizability, scalability, and user interface.  It
	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source
	    bug-tracking software in existence.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    That doesn't mean it can't use improvement!
	    You can help the project along by either hacking a patch yourself
	    that supports the functionality you require, or else submitting a
	    "Request for Enhancement" (RFE) using the bug submission interface
	    at <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Bugzilla">bugzilla.mozilla.org</ulink>.

	<question id="faq-general-mysql">
	  <para>
	    Why MySQL?  I'm interested in seeing Bugzilla run on
	    Oracle/Sybase/Msql/PostgreSQL/MSSQL.
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
            MySQL was originally chosen because it is free, easy to install,
            and was available for the hardware Netscape intended to run it on.
	  </para>
          <para>
            There is currently work in progress to make Bugzilla work on
            PostgreSQL and Sybase in the default distribution.  You can track
            the progress of these initiatives in bugs <ulink
            url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=98304">98304</ulink>

            respectively.
          </para>
          <para>
            Once both of these are done, adding support for additional
            database servers should be trivial.

	<question id="faq-general-bonsaitools">
	  <para>
	    Why do the scripts say
            <filename>/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl</filename> instead of
	    <filename>/usr/bin/perl</filename> or something else?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	     Mozilla.org used <filename>/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl</filename>,
             because originally Terry wanted a place to put a version of Perl
             and other tools that was strictly under his control.

            <para>
              This convention was abonded during the 2.17 development cycle so

	  <para>
	    It is web and e-mail based.  You can edit bugs by sending specially

	  <para>
	    Absolutely!  You can track any number of Products that can each be
            composed of any number of Components.
	  </para>
          <note>
            <para>There are only 55 groups available in version 2.16 of
            Bugzilla. If you are using product groups, this will also limit
            the number of products you can have. This limit does not exist in
            the current 2.17 development releases and will not exist in 2.18.

	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow attachments (text, screenshots, URLs etc)? If yes,
	    are there any that are NOT allowed?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes - any sort of attachment is allowed, although administrators can
      configure a maximum size.  
            Bugzilla gives the user the option of either using the MIME-type
            supplied by the browser, choosing from a pre-defined list or
            manually typing any arbitrary MIME-type. 
	  </para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question id="faq-phb-priorities">
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow us to define our own priorities and levels? Do we
	    have complete freedom to change the labels of fields and format of them, and
	    the choice of acceptable values?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  However, modifying some fields, notably those related to bug
	    progression states, also require adjusting the program logic to
	    compensate for the change.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    There is no GUI for adding fields to Bugzilla at this
	    time.  You can follow development of this feature at
	    <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=91037"/>.

	<question id="faq-phb-reporting">
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla provide any reporting features, metrics, graphs, etc? You
	    know, the type of stuff that management likes to see. :)
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  Look at <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/reports.cgi"/>
	    for samples of what Bugzilla can do in reporting and graphing.
	  </para>
	  <para>
            If you can not get the reports you want from the included reporting
            scripts, it is possible to hook up a professional reporting package
            such as Crystal Reports using ODBC. If you choose to do this,
            beware that giving direct access to the database does contain some
            security implications. Even if you give read-only access to the
            bugs database it will bypass the secure bugs features of Bugzilla.
	  </para>
          <note>
            <para>
              Bugzilla's current development versions can do a lot more in the
              way of reporting. To see examples, check out
              <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/report.cgi"/>.

	    Is there email notification and if so, what do you see when you get an
	    email?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Email notification is user-configurable.  By default, the bug id and 
      Summary of the bug report accompany each email notification, along with
	    a list of the changes made.

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Bugzilla email is sent in plain text, the most compatible mail format
	    on the planet.
	    <note>
	      <para>
		If you decide to use the bugzilla_email integration features
		to allow Bugzilla to record responses to mail with the associated bug,
		you may need to caution your users to set their mailer to "respond
		to messages in the format in which they were sent".  For security reasons
		Bugzilla ignores HTML tags in comments, and if a user sends HTML-based
		email into Bugzilla the resulting comment looks downright awful.

	<question id="faq-phb-data">
	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had outsiders
	    write up a bug report using a MS Word bug template, could that template be
	    imported into "matching" fields? If I wanted to take the results of a query
	    and export that data to MS Excel, could I do that?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
          <para>
            Bugzilla can only output buglists as HTML in version 2.16. There
            are other formats available (CSV and RDF) in the newer development
            versions.
          </para>

            Bugzilla can export bugs using <filename>xml.cgi</filename> with
            either a bug number or list of bug numbers.
          </para>
          <para>
            Currently the only script included with Bugzilla that can import
            data is <filename>importxml.pl</filename> which is intended to be
            used for importing the data generated by <filename>xml.cgi</filename>
            in association with bug moving. Any other use is left as an
            exercise for the user.
          </para>
          <para>
            There are also scripts included in the <filename>contrib/</filename>
            directory for using e-mail to import information into Bugzilla,
            but these scripts are not currently supported and included for
            educational purposes.

            The admin interfaces are still not included in these translated

	  <para>
	    What type of human resources are needed to be on staff to install and

	    individuals would we need to hire and how much would that cost vs buying an
	    "Out-of-the-Box" solution.
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    If Bugzilla is set up correctly from the start, continuing maintenance
      needs are minimal and can be done easily using the web interface.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Commercial Bug-tracking software typically costs somewhere upwards
	    of $20,000 or more for 5-10 floating licenses.  Bugzilla consultation

	<question id="faq-phb-installtime">
	  <para>
	    What time frame are we looking at if we decide to hire people to install
	    and maintain the Bugzilla? Is this something that takes hours or weeks to
	    install and a couple of hours per week to maintain and customize or is this
	    a multi-week install process, plus a full time job for 1 person, 2 people,
	    etc?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    It all depends on your level of commitment.  Someone with much Bugzilla

	     There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also generally

	    However, if you understand SQL you can use the <command>mysql</command>
            command line utility to manually insert, delete and modify table
            information.  There are also more intuitive GUI clients available.

	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Try running MySQL from its binary: "mysqld --skip-grant-tables". This
	    will allow you to completely rule out grant tables as the cause of your
            frustration. If this Bugzilla is able to connect at this point then

	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.  Synchronization will
	    only work one way -- you can create a read-only copy of the database
	    at one site, and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main
	    database.

	  <para>
	    MySQL has some synchronization features builtin to the latest releases.

	    synchronize two Bugzilla installations.

	    Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure

	    Microsoft has some advice on this matter, as well:
	    <blockquote>
	      <para>
		"Set application mappings. In the ISM, map the extension for the script
		file(s) to the executable for the script interpreter. For example, you might
		map the extension .py to Python.exe, the executable for the Python script
		interpreter. Note For the ActiveState Perl script interpreter, the extension
		.pl is associated with PerlIS.dll by default. If you want to change the
		association of .pl to perl.exe, you need to change the application mapping.
		In the mapping, you must add two percent (%) characters to the end of the
		pathname for perl.exe, as shown in this example: c:\perl\bin\perl.exe %s %s"
