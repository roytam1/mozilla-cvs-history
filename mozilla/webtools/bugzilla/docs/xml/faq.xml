      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Who maintains Bugzilla?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    There are many, many contributors from around the world maintaining Bugzilla.
	    The designated "Maintainer" is Tara Hernandez, with QA support by Matthew Tuck.
	    Dan Mosedale and Dawn Endico are employees of Mozilla.org responsible for the
	    installation of Bugzilla there, and are very frequent code contributors.
	    Terry Weissman originally ported Bugzilla, but "these days, Terry just hangs around
	    and heckles."  The rest of us are mostly transient developers; Bugzilla suits
	    our needs, and we contribute code as we have needs for updates.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    How does Bugzilla stack up against other bug-tracking databases?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    A year has gone by, and I <emphasis>still</emphasis> can't find any head-to-head
	    comparisons of Bugzilla against other defect-tracking software.  However, from my
	    personal experience with other bug-trackers, Bugzilla offers
	    superior performance on commodity hardware, better price (free!), more developer-
	    friendly features (such as stored queries, email integration, and platform
	    independence), improved scalability, open source code, greater flexibility,
	    and superior ease-of-use.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you happen to be a commercial Bugzilla vendor, please step forward with a rebuttal
	    so I can include it in the FAQ.  We're not in pursuit of Bugzilla ueber alles;
	    we simply love having a powerful, open-source tool to get our jobs done.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    How do I change my user name in Bugzilla?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    You can't.  However, the administrative account can, by simply opening
	    your user account in editusers.cgi and changing the login name.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Why doesn't Bugzilla offer this or that feature or compatability
	    with this other tracking software?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    It may be that the support has not been built yet, or that you
	    have not yet found it.  Bugzilla is making tremendous strides in
	    usability, customizability, scalability, and user interface.  It
	    is widely considered the most complete and popular open-source
	    bug-tracking software in existence.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    That doesn't mean it can't use improvement!
	    You can help the project along by either hacking a patch yourself
	    that supports the functionality you require, or else submitting a
	    "Request for Enhancement" (RFE) using the bug submission interface
	    at <ulink url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">bugzilla.mozilla.org</ulink>.
	  </para>
	</answer>
      </qandaentry>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Why MySQL?  I'm interested in seeing Bugzilla run on
	    Oracle/Sybase/Msql/PostgreSQL/MSSQL?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>Terry Weissman answers,
	  <blockquote>
	    <para>
	      You're not the only one. But <emphasis>I</emphasis> am not very interested. I'm not
	      a real SQL or database person. I just wanted to make a useful tool,
	      and build it on top of free software. So, I picked MySQL, and
	      learned SQL by staring at the MySQL manual and some code lying
	      around here, and
	      wrote Bugzilla. I didn't know that Enum's were non-standard SQL.
	      I'm not sure if I would have cared, but I didn't even know. So, to
	      me, things are "portable" because it uses MySQL, and MySQL is
	      portable enough. I fully understand (now) that people want to be
	      portable to other databases, but that's never been a real concern
	      of mine.
	    </para>
	  </blockquote>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Things aren't quite that grim these days, however.  Terry pretty much
	    sums up much of the thinking many of us have for Bugzilla, but there
	    is light on the horizon for database-independence!  Here are some options:
	  </para>

      <qandaentry>
	<question>
	  <para>
	    Why do the scripts say "/usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl" instead of
	    "/usr/bin/perl" or something else?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	     Mozilla.org uses /usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl. The prime rule in making
	    submissions is "don't break bugzilla.mozilla.org". If it breaks it, your
	    patch will be reverted faster than you can do a diff.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Here's Terry Weissman's comment, for some historical context:
	    <blockquote>
	      <para>
		[This was] purely my own convention. I wanted a place to put a version of
		Perl and other tools that was strictly under my control for the
		various webtools, and not subject to anyone else. Edit it to point
		to whatever you like.
	      </para>
	      <note>
		<para>
		  We always recommend that, if possible, you keep the path
		  as /usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl, and simply add a /usr/bonsaitools
		  and /usr/bonsaitools/bin directory, then symlink your version
		  of perl to /usr/bonsaitools/bin/perl.  This will make upgrading
		  your Bugzilla much easier in the future.
		</para>
		<para>
		  Obviously, if you do not have root access to your Bugzilla
		  box, our suggestion is irrelevant.

      <title>Red Hat Bugzilla</title>
      <para>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>This section is no longer up-to-date.</emphasis>

	<question>
	  <para>
	    What about Red Hat Bugzilla?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Red Hat Bugzilla is arguably more user-friendly, customizable, and scalable
	    than stock Bugzilla. Check it out at
	    http://bugzilla.redhat.com and the sources at ftp://people.redhat.com/dkl/.
	    They've set their Bugzilla up to work with Oracle out of the box.
	    Note that Redhat Bugzilla is based upon the 2.8 Bugzilla tree;
	    Bugzilla has made some tremendous advances since the 2.8 release.
	    Why not download both Bugzillas to check out the differences for
	    yourself?
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Dave Lawrence, the original Red Hat Bugzilla maintainer, mentions:
	    <blockquote>
	      <para>
		Somebody needs to take the ball and run with it.  I'm the only
		maintainer and am very pressed for time.
	      </para>
	    </blockquote>
	    If you, or someone you know, has the time and expertise to do the integration
	    work so main-tree Bugzilla 2.12 and higher integrates the Red
	    Hat Bugzilla Oracle modifications, please donate your
	    time to supporting the Bugzilla project.

	<question>
	  <para>
	    What are the primary benefits of Red Hat Bugzilla?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    <emphasis>Dave Lawrence</emphasis>:
	    <blockquote>
	      <para>
		For the record, we are not using any template type implementation for
		the cosmetic changes maded to Bugzilla.  It is just alot of html changes
		in the code itself.  I admit I may have gotten a little carried away with it
		but the corporate types asked for a more standardized interface to match up
		with other projects relating to Red Hat web sites.  A lot of other web based
		internal tools I am working on also look like Bugzilla.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		I do want to land the changes that I have made to Bugzilla but I may
		have to back out a good deal and make a different version of Red Hat's
		Bugzilla for checking in to CVS. Especially the cosmetic changes because it
		seems they may not fit the general public.  I will do that as soon as I can.
		I also still do my regular QA responsibilities along with Bugzilla so time
		is difficult sometimes to come by.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		There are also a good deal of other changes that were requested by
		management for things like support contracts and different permission
		groups for making bugs private. Here is a short list of the major
		changes that have been made:
	      </para>
	      <orderedlist>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    No enum types. All old enum types are now separate smaller tables.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    No bit wise operations. Not all databases support this so they were
		    changed to a more generic way of doing this task
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Bug reports can only be altered by the reporter, assignee, or a
		    privileged bugzilla user. The rest of the world can see the bug but in
		    a non-changeable format (unless the bug has been marked private).  They
		    can however add comments, add and remove themselves from the CC list
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Different group scheme. Each group has an id number related to it.
		    There is a user_group table which contains userid to groupid mappings
		    to determine which groups each user belongs to.  Additionally there is
		    a bug_group table that has bugid to groupid mappings to show which
		    groups can see a particular bug. If there are no entries for a bug in
		    this table then the bug is public.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Product groups. product_table created to only allow certain products to
		    be visible for certain groups in both bug entry and query. This was
		    particulary helpful for support contracts.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Of course many (too many) changes to Bugzilla code itself to allow use
		    with Oracle and still allow operation with Mysql if so desired.
		    Currently if you use Mysql it is set to use Mysql's old permission
		    scheme to keep breakage to a minimum. Hopefully one day this will
		    standardize on one style which may of course be something completely
		    different.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    Uses Text::Template perl module for rendering of the dynamic HTML pages
		    such as enter_bug.cgi, query.cgi, bug_form.pl, and for the header and
		    footer parts of the page. This allows the html to be separate from the
		    perl code for customizing the look and feel of the page to one's
		    preference.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
		  <para>
		    There are many other smaller changes. There is also a port to Oracle
		    that I have been working on as time permits but is not completely
		    finished but somewhat usable. I will merge it into our standard code
		    base when it becomes production quality. Unfortunately there will have
		    to be some conditionals in the code to make it work with other than
		    Oracle due to some differences between Oracle and Mysql.
		  </para>
		</listitem>
	      </orderedlist>
	      <para>
		Both the Mysql and Oracle versions of our current code base are
		available from ftp://people.redhat.com/dkl. If Terry/Tara wants I can submit
		patch files for all of the changes I have made and he can determine what is
		suitable for addition to the main bugzilla cade base. But for me to commit
		changes to the actual CVS I will need to back out alot of things that are
		not suitable for the rest of the Bugzilla community. I am open to
		suggestions.

	    <note>
	      <para>
		This information is somewhat dated; I last updated it
		7 June 2000.  Please see the "Variants" section of "The Bugzilla Guide"

	    <blockquote>
	      <para>
		     I suppose the current thread warrants an update on the status of
		Oracle and bugzilla ;) We have now been running Bugzilla 2.8 on
		Oracle for the last two days in our production environment. I
		tried to do as much testing as possible with it before going live
		which is some of the reason for the long delay. I did not get
		enough feedback as I would have liked from internal developers to
		help weed out any bugs still left so I said "Fine, i will take it
		live and then I will get the feedback I want :)" So it is now
		starting to stabilize and it running quite well after working
		feverishly the last two days fixing problems as soon as they came
		in from the outside world. The current branch in cvs is up2date if
		anyone would like to grab it and try it out. The oracle _setup.pl
		is broken right now due to some last minute changes but I will
		update that soon. Therefore you would probably need to create the
		database tables the old fashioned way using the supplied sql
		creation scripts located in the ./oracle directory. We have heavy
		optimizations in the database it self thanks to the in-house DBA
		here at Red Hat so it is running quite fast. The database itself
		is located on a dual PII450 with 1GB ram and 14 high voltage
		differential raided scsi drives. The tables and indexes are
		partitioned in 4 chuncks across the raided drive which is nice
		because when ever you need to do a full table scan, it is actually
		starting in 4 different locations on 4 different drives
		simultaneously. And the indexes of course are on separate drives
		from the data so that speeds things up tremendously. When  I can
		find the time I will document all that we have done to get this
		thing going to help others that may need it.
	      </para>
	      <para>
		As Matt has mentioned it is still using out-dated code and with a
		little help I would like to bring everything up to date for
		eventual  incorporation with the main cvs tree. Due to other
		duties I have with the company any help with this wiould be
		appreciated. What we are using  now is what I call a best first
		effort. It definitely can be improved on and may even need
		complete rewrites in a lot of areas. A lot of changes may have to
		be made in the way Bugzilla does things currently  to make this
		transition to a more generic database interface.  Fortunately when
		making the Oracle changes I made sure I didn't do  anything that I
		would consider Oracle specific and could not be easily done with
		other databases. Alot of the sql statements need to be broken up
		into smaller utilities that themselves would need to make
		decisions on what database they are using but the majority of the
		code can be made database neutral.

	    Loki's "Fenris" Bugzilla is based upon the (now ancient) Bugzilla 2.8

	    It works well enough for Loki.  Additionally, the major

		     You may have noticed that Fenris is a fork from Bugzilla-- our

		expressed interest in the code. Fenris has one major  improvement
		over Bugzilla, and that is individual comments are not appended
		onto a string blob, they are stored as a record in a separate
		table. This allows you to, for instance, separate comments out
		according to privilege levels in case your bug database could
		contain sensitive information not for public eyes. We also provide
		things like email hiding to protect user's privacy, additional
		fields such as 'user_affected' in case someone enters someone
		else's bug, comment editing and deletion, and more conditional
		system variables than Bugzilla does (turn off attachments,
		qacontact, etc.).

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  There are many specific MIME-types that are pre-defined by Bugzilla,
	    but you may specify any arbitrary MIME-type you need when you
	    upload the file.  Since all attachments are stored in the database,
	    however, I recommend storing large binary attachments elsewhere

	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Yes.  However, modifying some fields, notably those related to bug

Good point.  Yeah, easy enough to do, that it shouldn't be a big deal for
someone to take it on if they want it.  FAQ is a good place for it.

	  <para>
	    Does Bugzilla allow data to be imported and exported? If I had outsiders
	    write up a bug report using a MS Word bug template, could that template be
	    imported into "matching" fields? If I wanted to take the results of a query
	    and export that data to MS Excel, could I do that?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Mozilla allows data export through a custom DTD in XML format.
	    It does not, however, export to specific formats other than the
	    XML Mozilla DTD.  Importing the data into Excel or any other application
	    is left as an exercise for the reader.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you create import filters to other applications from Mozilla's XML,
	    please submit your modifications for inclusion in future Bugzilla
	    distributions.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    As for data import, any application can send data to Bugzilla through
	    the HTTP protocol, or through Mozilla's XML API.  However, it seems
	    kind of silly to put another front-end in front of Bugzilla;
	    it makes more sense to create a simplified bug submission form in

	    What type of human resources are needed to be on staff to install and

	    "Out-of-the-Box" solution.
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    If Bugzilla is set up correctly from the start, continuing maintenance needs

	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    It all depends on your level of commitment.  Someone with much Bugzilla

	    If you are using an alternate Mail Transport Agent (MTA other than

	  <para>
	    Red Hat Bugzilla, mentioned above, works with Oracle.  The current version
	    from Mozilla.org does not have this capability.  Unfortunately, though
	    you will sacrifice a lot of the really great features available in

	  <para>
	    Bugs are missing from queries, but exist in the database (and I can pull
	    them up by specifying the bug ID). What's wrong?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	     You've almost certainly enabled the "shadow database", but for some
	    reason it hasn't been updated for all your bugs. This is the database
	    against which queries are run, so that really complex or slow queries won't
	    lock up portions of the database for other users. You can turn off the
	    shadow database in editparams.cgi. If you wish to continue using the shadow
	    database, then as your "bugs" user run "./syncshadowdb -syncall" from the
	    command line in the bugzilla installation directory to recreate your shadow
	    database. After it finishes, be sure to check the params and make sure that
	    "queryagainstshadowdb" is still turned on. The syncshadowdb program turns it
	    off if it was on, and is supposed to turn it back on when completed; that
	    way, if it crashes in the middle of recreating the database, it will stay
	    off forever until someone turns it back on by hand. Apparently, it doesn't
	    always do that yet.

	    Run the "sanity check" utility (./sanitycheck.cgi in the bugzilla_home

	    OK (i.e. any red letters), there are certain things Bugzilla can recover

	  <para>
	     There is no facility in Bugzilla itself to do this. It's also generally
	    not a smart thing to do if you don't know exactly what you're doing.
	    However, if you understand SQL you can use the mysqladmin utility to
	    manually insert, delete, and modify table information. Personally, I
	    use "phpMyAdmin". You have to compile a PHP module with MySQL
	    support to make it work, but it's very clean and easy to use.

	    Try running MySQL from its binary: "mysqld --skip-grant-tables". This

	    How do I synchronize bug information among multiple different Bugzilla

	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Well, you can synchronize or you can move bugs.  Synchronization will
	    only work one way -- you can create a read-only copy of the database
	    at one site, and have it regularly updated at intervals from the main
	    database.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    MySQL has some synchronization features builtin to the latest releases.
	    It would be great if someone looked into the possibilities there
	    and provided a report to the newsgroup on how to effectively
	    synchronize two Bugzilla installations.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    If you simply need to transfer bugs from one Bugzilla to another,

	<answer>
	  <para>
	    Depending on what Web server you are using, you will have to configure

	    adding *.cgi to the App Mappings with the &lt;path&gt;\perl.exe %s %s as the
	    executable.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Microsoft has some advice on this matter, as well:
	    <blockquote>
	      <para>
		"Set application mappings. In the ISM, map the extension for the script
		file(s) to the executable for the script interpreter. For example, you might
		map the extension .py to Python.exe, the executable for the Python script
		interpreter. Note For the ActiveState Perl script interpreter, the extension
		.pl is associated with PerlIS.dll by default. If you want to change the
		association of .pl to perl.exe, you need to change the application mapping.
		In the mapping, you must add two percent (%) characters to the end of the
		pathname for perl.exe, as shown in this example: c:\perl\bin\perl.exe %s %s"

	    Can I have some general instructions on how to make Bugzilla on Win32 work?
	  </para>
	</question>
	<answer>
	  <para>
	    The following couple entries are deprecated in favor of the Windows installation
	    instructions available in the "Administration" portion of "The Bugzilla Guide".
	    However, they are provided here for historical interest and insight.
	    <literallayout>
  1. #!C:/perl/bin/perl had to be added to every perl file.
  2. Converted to Net::SMTP to handle mail messages instead of
     /usr/bin/sendmail.
  3. The crypt function isn't available on Windows NT (at least none that I
     am aware), so I made encrypted passwords = plaintext passwords.
  4. The system call to diff had to be changed to the Cygwin diff.
  5. This was just to get a demo running under NT, it seems to be working
     good, and I have inserted almost 100 bugs from another bug tracking
     system. Since this work was done just to get an in-house demo, I am NOT
     planning on making a patch for submission to Bugzilla. If you would
     like a zip file, let me know.

Q: Hmm, couldn't figure it out from the general instructions above.  How
about step-by-step?
A: Sure! Here ya go!

  1. Install IIS 4.0 from the NT Option Pack #4.
  2. Download and install Active Perl.
  3. Install the Windows GNU tools from Cygwin. Make sure to add the bin
     directory to your system path. (Everyone should have these, whether
     they decide to use Bugzilla or not. :-) )
  4. Download relevant packages from ActiveState at
     http://www.activestate.com/packages/zips/. + DBD-Mysql.zip
  5. Extract each zip file with WinZip, and install each ppd file using the
     notation: ppm install &lt;module&gt;.ppd
  6. Install Mysql.  *Note: If you move the default install from c:\mysql,
     you must add the appropriate startup parameters to the NT service. (ex.
     -b e:\\programs\\mysql)
  7. Download any Mysql client. http://www.mysql.com/download_win.html
  8. Setup MySql. (These are the commands that I used.)

          I. Cleanup default database settings.
           C:\mysql\bin\mysql -u root mysql
           mysql> DELETE FROM user WHERE Host='localhost' AND User='';
           mysql> quit
          C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin reload

          II. Set password for root.
           C:\mysql\bin\mysql -u root mysql
           mysql> UPDATE user SET Password=PASSWORD('new_password')
           WHERE user='root';
           mysql> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
           mysql> quit
           C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root reload

          III. Create bugs user.
           C:\mysql\bin\mysql -u root -p
           mysql> insert into user (host,user,password)
          values('localhost','bugs','');
           mysql> quit
           C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root reload

          IV. Create the bugs database.
           C:\mysql\bin\mysql -u root -p
           mysql> create database bugs;

          V. Give the bugs user access to the bugs database.
           mysql> insert into db
          (host,db,user,select_priv,insert_priv,update_priv,delete_priv,create_priv,drop_priv)
          values('localhost','bugs','bugs','Y','Y','Y','Y','Y','N')
           mysql> quit
           C:\mysql\bin\mysqladmin -u root reload
  9. Run the table scripts to setup the bugs database.
 10. Change CGI.pm to use the following regular expression because of
     differing backslashes in NT versus UNIX.
        o $0 =~ m:[^\\]*$:;
 11. Had to make the crypt password = plain text password in the database.
     (Thanks to Andrew Lahser" &lt;andrew_lahser@merck.com&gt;" on this one.) The
     files that I changed were:
        o globals.pl
        o CGI.pl
        o alternately, you can try commenting all references to 'crypt'
          string and replace them with similar lines but without encrypt()
          or crypr() functions insida all files.
 12. Replaced sendmail with Windmail. Basically, you have to come up with a
     sendmail substitute for NT. Someone said that they used a Perl module
     (Net::SMTP), but I was trying to save time and do as little Perl coding
     as possible.
 13. Added "perl" to the beginning of all Perl system calls that use a perl
     script as an argument and renamed processmail to processmail.pl.
 14. In processmail.pl, I added binmode(HANDLE) before all read() calls. I'm
     not sure about this one, but the read() under NT wasn't counting the
     EOLs without the binary read."
