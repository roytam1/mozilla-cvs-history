    <para>Bonsai is a web-based tool for managing 
    <xref linkend="cvs" />

    . Using Bonsai, administrators can control open/closed status of trees,
    query a fast relational database back-end for change, branch, and comment
    information, and view changes made since the last time the tree was
    closed. Bonsai
    also integrates with

    <para>CVS integration is best accomplished, at this point, using the
    Bugzilla Email Gateway.</para>

    <para>Follow the instructions in this Guide for enabling Bugzilla e-mail
    integration. Ensure that your check-in script sends an email to your
    Bugzilla e-mail gateway with the subject of 
    <quote>[Bug XXXX]</quote>, 
    and you can have CVS check-in comments append to your Bugzilla bug. If
    you have your check-in script include an @resolution field, you can even
    change the Bugzilla bug state.</para>

    <para>There is also a CVSZilla project, based upon somewhat dated 
    Bugzilla code, to integrate CVS and Bugzilla through CVS' ability to 
    email. Check it out at:

    is now an officially supported product from Perforce, and you can find

    .</para>

    <para>Integration of Perforce with Bugzilla, once patches are applied, is
    seamless. Perforce replication information will appear below the comments
    of each bug. Be certain you have a matching set of patches for the
    Bugzilla version you are installing. p4dti is designed to support
    multiple defect trackers, and maintains its own documentation for it.
    Please consult the pages linked above for further information.</para>
