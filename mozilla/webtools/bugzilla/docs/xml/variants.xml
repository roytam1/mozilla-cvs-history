  <title>Bugzilla Variants and Competitors</title>

  <para>I created this section to answer questions about Bugzilla competitors
  and variants, then found a wonderful site which covers an awful lot of what
  I wanted to discuss. Rather than quote it in its entirety, I'll simply
  refer you here:

  <section id="rhbugzilla" xreflabel="Red Hat Bugzilla">
    <title>Red Hat Bugzilla</title>

    <para>Red Hat Bugzilla is a fork of Bugzilla 2.8. 
    One of its major benefits is the ability
    to work with Oracle, MySQL, and PostGreSQL databases serving as the
    back-end, instead of just MySQL. Dave Lawrence of Red Hat is 
    active in the Bugzilla community, and we hope to see a reunification
    of the fork before too long.</para>

  <section id="variant-fenris" xreflabel="Loki Bugzilla, a.k.a. Fenris">
    <title>Loki Bugzilla (Fenris)</title>

    <para>Fenris was a fork from Bugzilla made by Loki Games; when
    Loki went into receivership, it died. While Loki's other code lives on,
    its custodians recommend Bugzilla for future bug-tracker deployments.

  <section id="variant-issuezilla" xreflabel="Issuezilla">
    <title>Issuezilla</title>

    <para>Issuezilla was another fork from Bugzilla, made by collab.net and
    hosted at tigris.org. It is also dead; the primary focus of bug-tracking 
    at tigris.org is their Java-based bug-tracker,

  <section id="variant-scarab" xreflabel="Scarab">
    <title>Scarab</title>

    <para>Scarab is a new open source bug-tracking system built using Java
    Serlet technology. It is currently at version 1.0 beta 8.</para>

    <title>Perforce SCM</title>

    <para>Although Perforce isn't really a bug tracker, it can be used as
    such through the <quote>jobs</quote>
    functionality.</para>

  <section id="variant-sourceforge" xreflabel="SourceForge">
    <title>SourceForge</title>

    <para>SourceForge is a way of coordinating geographically
    distributed free software and open source projects over the Internet.
    It has a built-in bug tracker, but it's not highly thought of.</para>
