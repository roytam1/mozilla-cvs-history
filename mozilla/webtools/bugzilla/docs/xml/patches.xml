    <title>Command-line Bugzilla Queries</title>
    <para>
      Users can query Bugzilla from the command line using this suite
      of utilities.
    </para>
    <para>
      The query.conf file contains the mapping from options to field
      names and comparison types.  Quoted option names are "grepped"
      for, so it should be easy to edit this file.  Comments (#) have
      no effect; you must make sure these lines do not contain any
      quoted "option"
    </para>
    <para>
      buglist is a shell script which submits a Bugzilla query and
      writes the resulting HTML page to stdout.  It supports both
      short options, (such as "-Afoo" or "-Rbar") and long options
      (such as "--assignedto=foo" or "--reporter=bar").  If the first
      character of an option is not "-", it is treated as if it were
      prefixed with "--default=".
    </para>
    <para>
      The columlist is taken from the COLUMNLIST environment variable.
      This is equivalent to the "Change Columns" option when you list
      bugs in buglist.cgi.  If you have already used Bugzilla, use
      <command>grep COLUMLIST ~/.netscape/cookies</command> to see
      your current COLUMNLIST setting.
    </para>
    <para>
      bugs is a simple shell script which calls buglist and extracts
      the bug numbers from the output.  Adding the prefix
      "http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?bug_id=" turns the bug
      list into a working link if any bugs are found. Counting bugs is
      easy.  Pipe the results through <command>sed -e 's/,/ /g' | wc |
	awk '{printf $2 "\n"}'</command>

    <title>The Quicksearch Utility</title>
    <para>
      Quicksearch is a new, experimental feature of the 2.12 release.
      It consist of two Javascript files, "quicksearch.js" and
      "localconfig.js", and two documentation files,
      "quicksearch.html" and "quicksearchhack.html"
    </para>
    <para>
      The index.html page has been updated to include the QuickSearch
      text box.
    </para>
    <para>
      To take full advantage of the query power, the Bugzilla
      maintainer must edit "localconfig.js" according to the value
      sets used in the local installation.
    </para>
    <para>
      Currently, keywords must be hard-coded in localconfig.js.  If
      they are not, keywords are not automatically recognized.  This
      means, if localconfig.js is left unconfigured, that searching
      for a bug with the "foo" keyword will only find bugs with "foo"
      in the summary, status whiteboard, product or component name,
      but not those with the keyword "foo".
    </para>
    <para>
      Workarounds for Bugzilla users:
      <simplelist>
	<member>search for '!foo' (this will find only bugs with the
	  keyword "foo"</member>
	<member>search 'foo,!foo' (equivalent to 'foo OR
	  keyword:foo')</member>
      </simplelist>
    </para>
    <para>
      When this tool is ported from client-side JavaScript to
      server-side Perl, the requirement for hard-coding keywords can
      be fixed. <ulink

  <section id="bzhacking">
    <title>Hacking Bugzilla</title>
    <para>
      What follows are some general guidelines for changing Bugzilla, and adhering to good coding practice while doing so.  We've had some checkins in the past which ruined Bugzilla installations because of disregard for these conventions.  Sorry for the lack of formatting; I got this info into the Guide on the day of 2.14 release and haven't formatted it yet.
    </para>
    <literallayout>

The following is a guide for reviewers when checking code into Bugzilla's
CVS repostory at mozilla.org.  If you wish to submit patches to Bugzilla,
you should follow the rules and style conventions below.  Any code that
does not adhere to these basic rules will not be added to Bugzilla's
codebase.

 1. Usage of variables in Regular Expressions

    It is very important that you don't use a variable in a regular
    expression unless that variable is supposed to contain an expression.
    This especially applies when using grep.  You should use:

    grep ($_ eq $value, @array);

    - NOT -

    grep (/$value/, @array);

    If you need to use a non-expression variable inside of an expression, be
    sure to quote it properly (using \Q..\E).

Coding Style for Bugzilla
-------------------------

While it's true that not all of the code currently in Bugzilla adheres to
this styleguide, it is something that is being worked toward.  Therefore,
we ask that all new code (submitted patches and new files) follow this guide
as closely as possible (if you're only changing 1 or 2 lines, you don't have
to reformat the entire file :).

 1. Whitespace

    Bugzilla's prefered indentation is 4 spaces (no tabs, please).

 2. Curly braces.

    The opening brace of a block should be on the same line as the statement
    that is causing the block and the closing brace should be at the same
    indentation level as that statement, for example:

    if ($var) {
        print "The variable is true";
    } else {
        print "Try again";
    }

    - NOT -

    if ($var)
    {
        print "The variable is true";
    }
    else
    {
        print "Try again";
    }

 3. File Names

    File names for bugzilla code and support documention should be legal across
    multiple platforms.  \ / : * ? " < > and | are all illegal characters for
    filenames on various platforms.  Also, file names should not have spaces in
    them as they can cause confusion in CVS and other mozilla.org utilities.

 4. Variable Names

    If a variable is scoped globally ($::variable) its name should be descriptive
    of what it contains.  Local variables can be named a bit looser, provided the
    context makes their content obvious.  For example, $ret could be used as a
    staging variable for a routine's return value as the line |return $ret;| will
    make it blatently obvious what the variable holds and most likely be shown
    on the same screen as |my $ret = "";|.

 5. Cross Database Compatability

    Bugzilla was originally written to work with MySQL and therefore took advantage
    of some of its features that aren't contained in other RDBMS software.  These
    should be avoided in all new code.  Examples of these features are enums and
    encrypt().

 6. Cross Platform Compatability

    While Bugzilla was written to be used on Unix based systems (and Unix/Linux is
    still the only officially supported platform) there are many who desire/need to
    run Bugzilla on Microsoft Windows boxes.  Whenever possible, we should strive
    not to make the lives of these people any more complicated and avoid doing things
    that break Bugzilla's ability to run on multiple operating systems.
