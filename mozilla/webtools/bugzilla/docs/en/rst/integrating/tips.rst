Integrating Bugzilla with Third-Party Tools
###########################################

Many utilities and applications can integrate with Bugzilla,
either on the client- or server-side. None of them are maintained
by the Bugzilla community, nor are they tested during our
QA tests, so use them at your own risk. They are listed at
`<https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Addons>`_.
