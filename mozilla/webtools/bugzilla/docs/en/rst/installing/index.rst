Installing Bugzilla
===================

.. note:: If you just want to *use* Bugzilla,
   you do not need to install it. None of this chapter is relevant to
   you. Ask your Bugzilla administrator for the URL to access it from
   your web browser. You may want to read :ref:`using`.

Bugzilla can be installed under Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, and perhaps other
operating systems. However, if you are setting it up on a dedicated machine
and you have control of the operating system to use, the Bugzilla team
wholeheartedly recommends Linux as an extremely versatile, stable, and robust
operating system that provides an ideal environment for Bugzilla. In that
case, you may want to read the :ref:`Quick Start instructions <quick-start>`.
