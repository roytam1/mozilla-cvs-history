Languages
=========

Bugzilla's templates can be localized, although it's a big job. If you have
a localized set of templates for your version of Bugzilla, Bugzilla can 
support multiple languages at once. In that case, Bugzilla honours the user's
``Accept-Language`` HTTP header when deciding which language to serve.

Many language templates can be obtained from
`the localization section of the Bugzilla website
<http://www.bugzilla.org/download.html#localizations>`_. Instructions
for submitting new languages are also available from that location.
