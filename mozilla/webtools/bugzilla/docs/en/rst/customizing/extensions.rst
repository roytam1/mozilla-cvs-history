Extensions
##########

One of the best ways to customize Bugzilla is by writing a Bugzilla
Extension. Bugzilla Extensions let you modify both the code and
UI of Bugzilla in a way that can be distributed to other Bugzilla
users and ported forward to future versions of Bugzilla with minimal
effort.

We maintain a
`list of available extensions <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Addons>`_
on our wiki. You would need to
make sure that the extension in question works with your version of Bugzilla.
