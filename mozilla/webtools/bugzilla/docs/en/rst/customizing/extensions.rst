Extensions
##########

One of the best ways to customize Bugzilla is by using a Bugzilla
Extension. Extensions can modify both the code and UI of Bugzilla in a way
that can be distributed to other Bugzilla users and ported forward to future
versions of Bugzilla with minimal effort.

We maintain a
`list of available extensions <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Bugzilla:Addons>`_
written by other people on our wiki. You would need to
make sure that the extension in question works with your version of Bugzilla.
Or you can look into :ref:`writing your own extension <writing-extensions>`.
