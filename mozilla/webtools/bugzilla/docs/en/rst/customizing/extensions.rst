Extensions
==========

One of the best ways to customize Bugzilla is by writing a Bugzilla
Extension. Bugzilla Extensions let you modify both the code and
UI of Bugzilla in a way that can be distributed to other Bugzilla
users and ported forward to future versions of Bugzilla with minimal
effort.

See the `Bugzilla Extension
documentation <../html/api/Bugzilla/Extension.html>`_ for information on how to write an Extension.
