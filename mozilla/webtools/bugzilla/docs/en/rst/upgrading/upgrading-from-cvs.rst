Upgrading from CVS

This will be a clone of the Bzr instructions but using CVS commands.
We might share some text using the include directive
if there is a long enough section to be worth splitting it out. But I'm
not going to fill it in until the Bzr instructions have had a review,
to save having to maintain two copies of the same stuff.
