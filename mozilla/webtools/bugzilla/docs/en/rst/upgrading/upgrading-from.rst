The procedure to switch to Git is as follows. The idea is to switch version
control systems without changing the exact version of Bugzilla you are using,
to minimise the risk of conflict or problems. Any major upgrade can then
happen as a separate step. 

Update Bugzilla To The Latest Point Release
===========================================

It is recommended that you switch while using the latest
point release for your major version. You can update to the latest point
release using bzr.

First, you need to find what version of Bugzilla you are using. It should be
in the top right corner of the front page but, if not, open the file
:file:`Bugzilla/Constants.pm` in your Bugzilla directory and search for
:code:`BUGZILLA_VERSION`.

Then, you need to find out what the latest point release for that major
version of Bugzilla is. The
`Bugzilla download page <http://www.bugzilla.org/download/>`_
should tell you that for supported versions. For versions out of support, here
is a list of the final point releases:

* 3.6.13
* 3.4.14
* 3.2.10
* 3.0.11

XXX Do we need below here? Are these versions in bzr? Will anyone be running
them from a bzr install?

* 2.22.7
* 2.20.7
* 2.18.6
* 2.16.11
* 2.14.5

If you are not currently running the latest point release, you should use the
following update command:

|updatecommand|

Where you replace $VERSION by the version number of the latest point release.
Then run checksetup to upgrade your database:

:command:`./checksetup.pl`

You should then test your Bugzilla carefully, or just use it for a day or two,
to make sure it's all still working fine.

Download Code from Git
======================

Download a copy of your current version of Bugzilla from the git repository
into a separate directory alongside your existing Bugzilla installation
(which we will assume is in a directory called :file:`bugzilla`).

You will need a copy of the git program. All Linux installations have it;
search your package manager for "git". On Windows or Mac OS X, you can
`download the official build <http://www.git-scm.com/downloads>`_.

Once git is installed, run these commands to pull a copy of Bugzilla:

:command:`git clone https://git.mozilla.org/bugzilla/bugzilla bugzilla-new`

:command:`cd bugzilla-new`

:command:`git checkout $VERSION`

Replace $VERSION with the two-digit version number of your current Bugzilla, e.g.
4.2. These command will automatically change your version to the latest
point release of version $VERSION.

Save Any Local Customizations
=============================

Go into your original Bugzilla directory and run this command:

|diffcommand|

If you have made customizations to your Bugzilla, and you made them by
changing the Bugzilla code itself (rather than using the Extension system),
then :file:`patch.diff` will have non-zero size. You will want to keep a copy
of those changes by keeping a copy of this file. If the file has zero size,
you haven't made any local customizations.

Shut Down Bugzilla
==================

At this point, you should shut down Bugzilla to make sure nothing changes
while you make the switch. Go into the administrative interface and put an
appropriate message into the :guilabel:`shutdownhtml` parameter, which is in the
"General" section of the administration parameters. As the name implies, HTML
is allowed.

This would be a good time to make :ref:`backups`. We shouldn't be affecting
the database, but you can't be too careful.

Copy Across Data and Modules
============================

Copy the contents of the following directories from your current installation
of Bugzilla into the corresponding directory in :file:`bugzilla-new/`:

.. code-block:: none

  lib/
  data/

You also need to copy an extensions you have written or installed, which are
in the :file:`extensions/` directory. In the Bugzilla directory, run this
command:

|extstatuscommand|

If any directories are listed as "unknown", copy those across.

Then, copy the following file from your current installation of Bugzilla
into the corresponding place in :file:`bugzilla-new/`:

.. code-block:: none

  localconfig

This file contains your database password and access details. Because your
two versions of Bugzilla are the same, this should all work fine.

Reapply Local Customizations
============================

If your :file:`patch.diff` file was zero sized, you can
jump to the next step. Otherwise, you have to apply the patch to your new
installation. If you are on Windows and you donâ€™t have the :command:`patch`
program, you can download it from
`GNUWin <http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/patch.htm>`_. Once
downloaded, you must copy patch.exe into the Windows directory. 

Copy :file:`patch.diff` into the :file:`bugzilla-new` directory and then do:

:command:`patch -p0 --dry-run < patch.diff`

The patch should apply cleanly because you have exactly the same version of
Bugzilla in both directories. If it does, remove the :command:`--dry-run` and
rerun the command to apply it for real. If it does not apply cleanly, it is
likely that you have managed to get a Bugzilla version mismatch between the
two directories.

Swap The New Version In
=======================

Now we swap the directories over, and run checksetup.pl to confirm that all
is well. From the directory containing the :file:`bugzilla` and
:file:`bugzilla-git` directories, run:

:command:`mv bugzilla bugzilla-old`

:command:`mv bugzilla-new bugzilla`

:command:`cd bugzilla`

:command:`./checksetup.pl`

Running :file:`checksetup.pl` should not result in any changes to your database at
the end of the run. If it does, then it's most likely that the two versions
of Bugzilla you have are not, in fact, the same.

Re-enable Bugzilla
==================

Go into the administrative interface and clear the contents of the
:guilabel:`shutdownhtml` parameter.

Test Bugzilla
=============

Use your Bugzilla for several days to check that the switch has had no
detrimental effects. Then, if necessary, follow the instructions in
:ref:`upgrading-with-git` to upgrade to the latest version of Bugzilla.

Rolling Back
============

If something goes wrong at any stage of the switching process (e.g. your
patch doesn't apply, or checksetup doesn't complete), you can always just
switch the directories back (if you've got that far) and re-enable Bugzilla
(if you disabled it) and then seek help. Even if you have re-enabled Bugzilla,
and find a problem a little while down the road, you are still using the same
version so there would be few side effects to switching the directories back
a day or three later.
