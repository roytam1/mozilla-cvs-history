Upgrading with a Tarball
########################

If you are unable (or unwilling) to use Git, another option that's
always available is to obtain the latest tarball from the `Download Page <http://www.bugzilla.org/download/>`_ and
upgrade your Bugzilla installation from that.

The best way to do this is to untar the tarball into a new directory (not
on top of your existing installation), copy any data and configuration across
to that directory, and then switch the directories over.

XXX This now needs much the same info as an SCM switch about having
parallel directories and copying stuff over.
