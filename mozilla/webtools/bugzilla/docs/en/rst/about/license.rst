Bugzilla is `free <http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>`_ and
`open source <http://opensource.org/osd>`_ software, which means (among other
things) that you can download it, install it and run it for any purpose
whatsoever without the need for license or payment. Isn't that refreshing?

Bugzilla's code is made available under the
`Mozilla Public License 2.0 <http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/>`_ (MPL),
specifically the variant which is Incompatible with Secondary Licenses.
However, again, if you only want to install and run Bugzilla, you don't need
to worry about that; it's only relevant if you redistribute the code or any
changes you make.
