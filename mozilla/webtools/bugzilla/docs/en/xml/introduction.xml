    <title>What is Bugzilla?</title>

    <para>
    Bugzilla is a bug- or issue-tracking system. Bug-tracking
    systems allow individual or groups of developers effectively to keep track
    of outstanding problems with their products.

    <title>Why use a bug-tracking system?</title>
    
    <para>For many years, defect-tracking software was principally
    the domain of large software development houses. Most smaller shops
    simply relied on
    shared lists and email to monitor the status of defects. This procedure
    was error-prone and tended to cause those bugs judged least significant by
    developers to be dropped or ignored.</para>

    <para>Integrated
    defect-tracking systems reduce downtime, increase productivity, and raise
    customer satisfaction with their systems. Along with full disclosure, an
    open bug-tracker allows you to keep in touch with your clients
    and resellers, to communicate about problems effectively throughout the
    data management chain. Many corporations have also discovered that
    defect-tracking helps reduce costs by providing IT support
    accountability, telephone support knowledge bases, and a common,
    well-understood method for accounting for unusual system or software
    issues.</para>

    <para>Bugzilla is very adaptable to various situations. Known uses
    currently include IT support queues, Systems Administration deployment
    management, chip design and development problem tracking (both
    pre-and-post fabrication), and software and hardware bug tracking for
    luminaries such as Redhat, NASA, Linux-Mandrake, and VA Systems.
    Combined with systems such as

    <ulink url="http://www.perforce.com">Perforce SCM</ulink>, Bugzilla
    provides a powerful, easy-to-use solution to configuration management and
    replication problems.</para>
