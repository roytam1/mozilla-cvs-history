      Although the Bugzilla development team has taken great care to
      ensure that all exploitable bugs or options have been
      fixed, security holes surely exist. Great care should be taken both in 
      the installation and usage of this software. The Bugzilla development
      team members assume no liability for your use of this software. You have 
      the source code, and are responsible for auditing it yourself to ensure
      your security needs are met.
