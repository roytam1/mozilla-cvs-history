    <TITLE>Purpose and Scope of this Guide</TITLE>
    <PARA>
      This document was started on September 17, 2000
      by Matthew P. Barnson after a great deal of procrastination updating the Bugzilla FAQ,
      which I left untouched for nearly half a year.
      After numerous complete rewrites and reformatting, it is the document you see today.
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
      Despite the lack of updates, Bugzilla is simply the best piece of bug-tracking software
      the world has ever seen.  This document is intended to be the comprehensive guide to 
      the installation, administration, maintenance, and use of the Bugzilla bug-tracking system.
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
      This release of the Bugzilla Guide is the <EMPHASIS>2.11</EMPHASIS> release.
      It is so named that it may match the current version of Bugzilla.
      The numbering tradition stems from that used for many free software projects,
      in which <EMPHASIS>even-numbered</EMPHASIS> point releases (1.2, 1.14, etc.)
      are considered "stable releases", intended for public consumption; on the other 
      hand, <EMPHASIS>odd-numbered</EMPHASIS> point releases (1.3, 2.09, etc.)
      are considered unstable <EMPHASIS>development</EMPHASIS> releases intended
      for advanced users, systems administrators, developers, and those who enjoy
      a lot of pain. 
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
      Newer revisions of the Bugzilla Guide will follow the numbering conventions of
      the main-tree Bugzilla releases, available at
      <ULINK URL="http://www.mozilla.org/bugs/source.html">Mozilla.org</ULINK>, with
      the exception that intermediate releases will have a minor revision number
      following a period.  For instance, if the current version of Bugzilla is 4.2,
      the current "stable" version of the Bugzilla guide, in, say, it's fifth revision,
      would be numbered "4.2.5".  Got it?  Good.
    </PARA>
    <PARA>
      I wrote this in response to the enormous demand for decent Bugzilla documentation.
      I have incorporated instructions from the Bugzilla README, Frequently Asked Questions,
      Database Schema Document, and various mailing lists to create it.
      Chances are, there are glaring errors in this documentation; please contact
      <EMAIL>barnboy@trilobyte.net</EMAIL> to correct them.

      You are strongly recommended to make a backup of your system before
      installing Bugzilla and at regular intervals thereafter.  Heaven knows
      it's saved my bacon time after time; if you implement any suggestion in 
      this Guide, implement this one!

      Bugzilla has not undergone a complete security review.
      Security holes probably exist in the code.
      Great care should be taken both in the installation and usage of this software.
      Carefully consider the implications of installing other network services with Bugzilla.
