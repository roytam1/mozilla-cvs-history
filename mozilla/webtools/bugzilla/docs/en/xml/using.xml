    <title>What is Bugzilla?</title>
    <para>
      Bugzilla is one example of a class of programs called "Defect
Tracking Systems", or, more commonly, "Bug-Tracking Systems".  Defect
Tracking Systems allow individual or groups of developers to keep
track of outstanding bugs in their product effectively. Bugzilla was
originally written by Terry Weissman in a programming language called
"TCL", to replace a crappy bug-tracking database used internally for
Netscape Communications.  Terry later ported Bugzilla to Perl from
TCL, and in Perl it remains to this day. Most commercial
defect-tracking software vendors at the time charged enormous
licensing fees, and Bugzilla quickly became a favorite of the
open-source crowd (with its genesis in the open-source browser
project, Mozilla).  It is now the de-facto standard defect-tracking
system against which all others are measured.

    <para>
      Bugzilla has matured immensely, and now boasts many advanced features.  These include:

    <para>
      Despite its current robustness and popularity, Bugzilla faces
      some near-term challenges, such as reliance on a single
      database, a lack of abstraction of the user interface and
      program logic, verbose email bug notifications, a powerful but
      daunting query interface, little reporting configurability,
      problems with extremely large queries, some unsupportable bug
      resolution options, little internationalization (although non-US
      character sets are accepted for comments), and dependence on
      some nonstandard libraries.
    </para>
    <para>
      Some recent headway has been made on the query front, however.
      If you are using the latest version of Bugzilla, you should see
      a <quote>simple search</quote> form on the default front page of
      your Bugzilla install.  Type in two or three search terms and
      you should pull up some relevant information.  This is also
      available as "queryhelp.cgi".
    </para>
    <para>
      Despite these small problems, Bugzilla is very hard to beat.  It
      is under <emphasis>very</emphasis> active development to address
      the current issues, and continually gains new features.

  <section id="why">
    <title>Why Should We Use Bugzilla?</title>
    <epigraph>
      <para>
	No, Who's on first...
      </para>
    </epigraph>
    <para>
      For many years, defect-tracking software has remained
      principally the domain of large software development houses.
      Even then, most shops never bothered with bug-tracking software,
      and instead simply relied on shared lists and email to monitor
      the status of defects.  This procedure is error-prone and tends
      to cause those bugs judged least significant by developers to be
      dropped or ignored.
    </para>
    <para>
      These days, many companies are finding that integrated
      defect-tracking systems reduce downtime, increase productivity,
      and raise customer  satisfaction with their systems.  Along with
      full disclosure, an open bug-tracker allows manufacturers to
      keep in touch with their clients and resellers, to communicate
      about problems effectively throughout the data management chain.
      Many corporations have also discovered that defect-tracking
      helps reduce costs by providing IT support accountability,
      telephone support knowledge bases, and a common, well-understood
      system for accounting for unusual system or software issues.
    </para>
    <para>
      But why should <emphasis>you</emphasis> use Bugzilla?
    </para>
    <para>
      Bugzilla is very adaptable to various situations.  Known uses
      currently include IT support queues, Systems Administration
      deployment management, chip design and development problem
      tracking (both pre-and-post fabrication), and software and
      hardware bug tracking for luminaries such as Redhat, Loki
      software, Linux-Mandrake, and VA Systems.  Combined with systems
      such as CVS, Bonsai, or Perforce SCM, Bugzilla provides a
      powerful, easy-to-use  solution to configuration management and
      replication problems
    </para>
    <para>
      Bugzilla can dramatically increase the productivity and
      accountability of individual employees by providing a documented
      workflow and positive feedback for good performance.  How many
      times do you wake up in the morning, remembering that you were
      supposed to do <emphasis>something</emphasis> today, but you
      just can't quite remember?  Put it in Bugzilla, and you have a
      record of it from which you can extrapolate milestones, predict
      product versions for integration, and by using Bugzilla's e-mail
      integration features be able to follow the discussion trail that
      led to critical decisions.
    </para>
    <para>
      Ultimately, Bugzilla puts the power in your hands to improve
      your value to your employer or business while providing a usable
      framework for your natural attention to detail and knowledge
      store to flourish.

      Bugzilla is a large, complex system.  Describing how to use it
      requires some time.  If you are only interested in installing or
      administering a Bugzilla installation, please consult the
      Installing and Administering Bugzilla portions of this Guide.
      This section is principally aimed towards developing end-user
      mastery of Bugzilla, so you may fully enjoy the benefits
      afforded by using this reliable open-source bug-tracking
      software.

      </note> Although Landfill serves as a great introduction to
      Bugzilla, it does not offer all the options you would have as a
      user on your own installation of Bugzilla, nor can it do more
      than serve as a general introduction to Bugzilla.  Additionally,
      Landfill often runs cutting-edge versions of Bugzilla for
      testing, so some things may work slightly differently than
      mentioned here.

      <title>The Bugzilla Query Page</title>
      <para>
	The Bugzilla Query Page is the heart and soul of the Bugzilla
	user experience.  It is the master interface where you can
	find any bug report, comment, or patch currently in the
	Bugzilla system.  We'll go into how to create your own bug

      <para>
	There are efforts underway to simplify query usage.  If you
	have a local installation of Bugzilla 2.12 or higher, you
	should have <filename>quicksearch.html</filename> available to
	use and simplify your searches.  There is also a helper for

      </para>
      <para>
	The first thing you need to notice about the Bugzilla Query
	Page is that nearly every box you see on your screen has a

	the upper-left-hand corner of your browser window you should
	see the word <quote>Status</quote> underlined.  Select it.

      <para>
	I'm sure that after checking out the online help, you are now
	an expert on the Bugzilla Query Page.  If, however, you feel
	you haven't mastered it yet, let me walk you through making a

	Bugzilla bug-tracking system itself.
      </para>
      <orderedlist>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Ensure you are back on the <quote>Bugzilla Query
	      Page</quote>. Do nothing in the boxes marked "Status",
	    "Resolution", "Platform", "OpSys", "Priority", or
	    "Severity".  The default query for "Status" is to find all
	    bugs that are NEW, ASSIGNED, or REOPENED, which is what we
	    want.  If you don't select anything in the other 5
	    scrollboxes there, then you are saying that "any of these
	    are OK"; we're not locking ourselves into only finding
	    bugs on the "DEC" Platform, or "Windows 95" OpSys
	    (Operating System).  You're smart, I think you have it
	    figured out.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Basically, selecting <emphasis>anything</emphasis> on the
	    query page narrows your search down.  Leaving stuff
	    unselected, or text boxes unfilled, broadens your search.
	  </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    You see the box immediately below the top six boxes that
	    contains an "Email" text box,  with the words "matching
	    as", a drop-down selection box, then some checkboxes with
	    "Assigned To" checked by default?  This allows you to
	    filter your search down based upon email address.  Let's
	    put my email address in there, and see what happens.
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    Type "barnboy@trilobyte.net" in the top Email text box.
	  </para>
	</listitem>

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Let's narrow the search some more.  Scroll down until you
	    find the box with the word "Program" over the top of it.
	    This is where we can narrow our search down to only
	    specific products (software programs or product lines) in
	    our Bugzilla database. Please notice the box is a
	    <emphasis>scrollbox</emphasis>.  Using the down arrow on
	    the scrollbox, scroll down until you can see an entry
	    called "Bugzilla".  Select this entry.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Did you notice that some of the boxes to the right changed
	    when you selected "Bugzilla"? Every Program (or Product)
	    has different Versions, Components, and Target Milestones
	    associated with it.  A "Version" is the number of a
	    software program.
	    <example>
	      <title>Some Famous Software Versions</title>
	      <informalexample>
		<para>
		  Do you remember the hype in 1995 when Microsoft
		  Windows 95(r) was released? It may have been several
		  years ago, but Microsoft(tm) spent over $300 Million
		  advertising this new Version of their software.
		  Three years later, they released Microsoft Windows
		  98(r), another new version, to great fanfare, and
		  then in 2000 quietly  released Microsoft Windows
		  ME(Millenium Edition)(r). 
		</para>
		<para>
		  Software "Versions" help a manufacturer
		  differentiate their current product from their
		  previous products.  Most do not identify their
		  products by the year they were released. Instead,
		  the "original" version of their software will often
		  be numbered "1.0", with small bug-fix releases on
		  subsequent tenths of a digit.  In most cases, it's
		  not a decimal number; for instance, often 1.9 is an
		  <emphasis>older</emphasis> version of the software
		  than 1.11, but is a <emphasis>newer</emphasis>
		  version than 1.1.1.
		</para>
		<para>
		  In general, a "Version" in Bugzilla should refer to
		  <emphasis>released</emphasis> products, not products
		  that have not yet been released  to the public.
		  Forthcoming products are what the Target Milestone
		  field is for.
		</para>
	      </informalexample>
	    </example>
	  </para>
	  <para>
	    A "Component" is a piece of a Product.
	    It may be a standalone program, or some other logical
	    division of a Product or Program. 
	    Normally, a Component has a single Owner, who is responsible
	    for overseeing efforts to improve that Component.

	    A "Milestone", or "Target Milestone" is a often a planned
	    future "Version" of a product.  In many cases, though,
	    Milestones simply represent significant dates for a
	    developer.  Having certain features in your Product is
	    frequently tied to revenue (money) the developer will
	    receive if the features work by the time she  reaches the
	    Target Milestone. Target Milestones are a great tool to
	    organize your time. If someone will pay you $100,000 for
	    incorporating certain features by a certain date, those
	    features by that Milestone date become a very high
	    priority.  Milestones tend to be highly malleable
	    creatures, though, that appear to be in reach but are out
	    of reach by the time the important day arrives.

	    Target Milestone can just as easily be a specific date,
	    code name, or weird alphanumeric combination, like "M19".

	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    OK, now let's select the "Bugzilla" component from its scrollbox.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Skip down the page a bit -- do you see the "submit query" button?
	    Select it, and let's run
	    this query!
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem>
	  <para>
	    Congratulations!  You've completed your first Query, and
	    have before you the Bug List of the author of this Guide,
	    Matthew P. Barnson (barnboy@trilobyte.net).  If I'm doing
	    well, you'll have a cryptic "Zarro Boogs Found" message on
	    your screen.  It is just a happy hacker's way of saying
	    "Zero Bugs Found".  However, I am fairly certain I will
	    always have some bugs assigned to me that aren't done yet,
	    so you won't often see that message!
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>
	I encourage you to click the bug numbers in the left-hand
	column and examine my bugs.  Also notice that if you click the
	underlined  links near the top of this page, they do not take
	you to context-sensitive help here, but instead sort the
	columns of bugs on the screen! When you need to sort your bugs
	by priority, severity, or the people they are assigned to,
	this is a tremendous timesaver.
      </para>
      <para>
	A couple more interesting things about the Bug List page:
	<simplelist>
	  <member><emphasis>Change Columns</emphasis>: by selecting
	    this link, you can show all kinds of information in the
	    Bug List</member>
	  <member><emphasis>Change several bugs at once</emphasis>: If
	    you have sufficient rights to change all the bugs shown in
	    the Bug List, you can mass-modify them. This is a big
	    time-saver.</member>
	  <member><emphasis>Send mail to bug owners</emphasis>: If you
	    have many related bugs, you can request an update from
	    every person who owns the bugs in the Bug List asking them
	    the status.</member>
	  <member><emphasis>Edit this query</emphasis>: If you didn't
	    get exactly the results you were looking for, you can
	    return to the Query page through this link and make small
	    revisions to the query you just made so you get more
	    accurate results.</member>
	</simplelist>
      </para>
      <note>
	<para>
	  There are many more options to the Bugzilla Query Page  and
	  the Bug List than I have shown you. But this should be
	  enough for you to learn to get around. I encourage you to
	  check out the <ulink
			       url="http://www.mozilla.org/bugs/">Bugzilla Home Page</ulink> to learn about the Anatomy and Life Cycle of a Bug before continuing.

	<title>Writing a Great Bug Report</title>
	<para>
	  Before we plunge into writing your first bug report, I
	  encourage you to read some bug-writing guidelines.  If you
	  are reading this document as part of a Bugzilla CVS checkout
	  or un-tarred Bugzilla distribution, you should be able to
	  read them by clicking <ulink
				       url="../../bugwritinghelp.html">here</ulink>.  If you are reading this online, check out the Mozilla.org bug-writing guidelines at <ulink url="http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html">http://www.mozilla.org/quality/bug-writing-guidelines.html</ulink>.  While some of the advice is Mozilla-specific, the basic principles of reporting Reproducible, Specific bugs, isolating the Product you are using, the Version of the Product, the Component which failed, the Hardware Platform, and Operating System you were using at the time of the failure go a long way toward ensuring accurate, responsible fixes for the bug that bit you.
	</para>
	<para>
	  While you are at it, why not learn how to find previously
	  reported bugs?  Mozilla.org has published a great tutorial
	  on finding duplicate bugs, available at <ulink

	  You have now learned the basics of Bugzilla navigation,

	  We'll spend no more time on individual Bugs or Queries from
	  this point on, so you are on your own there.
	</para>
	<para>
	  But I'll give a few last hints!
	</para>
	<para>
	  There is a <ulink
			    url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/help.html">CLUE</ulink> on the Query page that will teach you more how to use the form.
	</para>
	<para>
	  If you click the hyperlink on the <ulink
						   url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/describecomponents.cgi">Component</ulink> box of the Query page, you will be presented a form that will describe what all the components are.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Possibly the most powerful feature of the Query page is the
	  <ulink
		 url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/booleanchart.html">Boolean Chart</ulink> section. It's a bit confusing to use the first time, but can provide unparalleled flexibility in your queries, allowing you to build extremely powerful requests.
	</para>
	<para>
	  Finally, you can build some nifty  <ulink
						    url="http://bugzilla.mozilla.org/reports.cgi">Reports</ulink> using the "Bug Reports" link near the bottom of the query page, and also available via the "Reports" link at the footer of each page.

      Customized User Preferences offer tremendous versatility to your

      <title>Account Settings</title>
      <para>
	On this page, you can change your basic Account Settings,
	including your password and full name. For security reasons,
	in order to change anything on this page you must type your
	<emphasis>current</emphasis> password into the <quote>Old
	  Password</quote> field.  If you wish to change your
	password, type the new password you want into the <quote>New
	  Password</quote> field and again into the <quote>Re-enter
	  new password</quote> field to ensure you typed your new
	password correctly.  Select the <quote>Submit</quote> button

      <section id="notification" xreflabel="">
	<title>Email Notification</title>
	<para>
	  Here you can reduce or increase the amount of email sent you
	  from Bugzilla.  Although this is referred to as
	  <quote>Advanced Email Filtering Options</quote>, they are,
	  in fact, the standard email filter set.  All of them are
	  self-explanatory, but you can use the filters in interesting
	  ways.  For instance, some people (notably Quality Assurance
	  personnel) often only care to receive updates regarding a
	  bug when the bug changes state, so they can track bugs on
	  their flow charts and know when it is time to pull the bug
	  onto a quality assurance platform for inspection.  Other
	  people set up email gateways to
	    <xref linkend="bonsai"> or <xref linkend="tinderbox">, and
	  restrict which types of Bugzilla information are fed to
	  these systems..

      </section>
      <section id="newemailtech">
	<title>New Email Technology</title>
	<note>
	  <para>
	    This option may not be available in all Bugzilla
	    installations, depending upon the preferences of the
	    systems administrator responsible for the setup of your
	    Bugzilla. However, if you really want this functionality,
	    ask her to "enable newemailtech in Params" and "make it
	    the default for all new users", referring her to the
	    Administration section of this Guide.
	  </para>
	</note>
	<para>
	  Disregard the warnings about "experimental and bleeding
	  edge"; the code to handle email in a cleaner manner than
	  that historically used for Bugzilla is quite robust and
	  well-tested now.
	</para>
	<para>
	  I recommend you enable the option, "Click here to sign up
	  (and risk any bugs)". Your email-box will thank you for it.
	  The fundamental shift in "newemailtech" is away from
	  standard UNIX "diff" output, which is quite ugly, to a
	  prettier, better laid-out email.

	    Bugzilla. However, if you really want this functionality,
	    ask her to "enable watchers in Params".
	  </para>
	</note>
	<para>
	  By entering user email names into the "Users to watch" text
	  entry box, delineated by commas, you can watch bugs of other
	  users.  This powerful functionality enables seamless
	  transitions as developers change projects, managers wish to
	  get in touch with the issues faced by their direct reports,
	  or users go on vacation.  If any of these three situations
	  apply to you, you will undoubtedly find this feature quite
	  convenient.

    <section id="footersettings">
      <title>Page Footer</title>
      <note>
	<para>
	  By default, this page is quite barren.  However, go explore
	  the Query Page some more; you will find that you can store
	  numerous queries on the server, so if you regularly run a
	  particular query it is just a drop-down menu away.  On this
	  page of Preferences, if you have many stored queries you can
	  elect to have them always one-click away!
	</para>
      </note>
      <para>
	If you have many stored queries on the server, here you will
	find individual drop-downs for each stored query.  Each
	drop-down gives you the option of that query appearing on the
	footer of every page in Bugzilla!  This gives you powerful
	one-click access to any complex searches you may set up, and
	is an excellent way to impress your boss...
      </para>
      <tip>
	<para>By default, the "My Bugs" link appears at the bottom of
	  each page.  However, this query gives you both the bugs you
	  have reported, as well as those you are assigned.  One of
	  the most common uses for this page is to remove the "My
	  Bugs" link, replacing it with two other queries, commonly
	  called "My Bug Reports" and "My Bugs" (but only referencing
	  bugs assigned to you).  This allows you to distinguish those
	  bugs you have reported from those you are assigned.  I
	  commonly set up complex Boolean queries in the Query page
	  and link them to my footer in this page.  When they are
	  significantly complex, a one-click reference can save hours
	  of work.</para>
