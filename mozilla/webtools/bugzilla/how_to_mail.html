<TITLE>How to Mail to bugzilla</TITLE>

<H1>THIS DOESN'T WORK RIGHT NOW.  Coming someday.</H1>

Mailing to "bugzilla" will be piped through a script which examines
your message, stripping out control lines, and passing the rest of the
message in as the description of a new bug.  The control lines look like: <P>

<PRE>
@FIELD-LABEL VALUE
        LABEL           Legal Values
        Priority        critical major normal minor trivial

        URL             -anything-
        Assign          someone in eng


and

@description
        This tells the bug parse to stop looking for control lines,
        allowing the bug description to contain lines which start with @
</PRE>

There are default values for all these fields.  If you don't specify a
Summary, the subject of the mail message is used. <P>

If you specify an illegal value, the default value is used, the
bug is assigned to you, and the answerback message will describe
the error. <P>

After the bug is posted, you will get mail verifying the posting
and informing you of the bug number if you wish to fix any
mistakes made by the auto-processor. <P>

EXAMPLE: <P>


<PRE>
    % Mail bugzilla
    Subject: WinFE crashes with GPF when I pour beer on my keyboard
    @priority critical
    @platform PC
    @assign troy

    After the beer bash I emptied the rest of the keg onto my keyboard
    and my sharp build of Navigator got a GPF.
