=head1 NAME

Bugzilla::Install::Util - Utility functions that are useful both during
installation and afterwards.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains various subroutines that are used primarily
during installation. However, these subroutines can also be useful to
non-installation code, so they have been split out into this module.

The difference between this module and L<Bugzilla::Util> is that this
module is safe to C<use> anywhere in Bugzilla, even during installation,
because it depends only on L<Bugzilla::Constants> and built-in perl modules.

None of the subroutines are exported by default--you must explicitly
export them.

=head1 SUBROUTINES

=over

=item C<get_version_and_os>

Returns a hash containing information about what version of Bugzilla we're
running, what perl version we're using, and what OS we're running on.

=item C<indicate_progress>

=over

=item B<Description>

This prints out lines of dots as a long update is going on, to let the user
know where we are and that we're not frozen. A new line of dots will start
every 60 dots.

Sample usage: C<indicate_progress({ total =E<gt> $total, current =E<gt>
$count, every =E<gt> 1 })>

=item B<Sample Output>

Here's some sample output with C<total = 1000> and C<every = 10>:

 ............................................................600/1000 (60%)
 ........................................

=item B<Params>

=over

=item C<total> - The total number of items we're processing.

=item C<current> - The number of the current item we're processing.

=item C<every> - How often the function should print out a dot.
For example, if this is 10, the function will print out a dot every
ten items. Defaults to 1 if not specified.

=back

=item B<Returns>: nothing

=back

=item C<install_string>

=over

=item B<Description>

This is a very simple method of templating strings for installation.
It should only be used by code that has to run before the Template Toolkit
can be used. (See the comments at the top of the various L<Bugzilla::Install>
modules to find out when it's safe to use Template Toolkit.)

It pulls strings out of the F<strings.txt.pl> "template" and replaces
any variable surrounded by double-hashes (##) with a value you specify.

This allows for localization of strings used during installation.

=item B<Example>

Let's say your template string looks like this:

 The ##animal## jumped over the ##plant##.
 
Let's say that string is called 'animal_jump_plant'. So you call the function
like this:

 install_string('animal_jump_plant', { animal => 'fox', plant => 'tree' });

That will output this:

 The fox jumped over the tree.

=item B<Params>

=over

=item C<$string_id> - The name of the string from F<strings.txt.pl>.

=item C<$vars> - A hashref containing the replacement values for variables
inside of the string.

=back

=item B<Returns>: The appropriate string, with variables replaced.

=back

=item C<vers_cmp>

=over

=item B<Description>

This is a comparison function, like you would use in C<sort>, except that
it compares two version numbers. So, for example, 2.10 would be greater
than 2.2.

It's based on versioncmp from L<Sort::Versions>, with some Bugzilla-specific
fixes.

=item B<Params>: C<$a> and C<$b> - The versions you want to compare.

=item B<Returns>

C<-1> if C<$a> is less than C<$b>, C<0> if they are equal, or C<1> if C<$a>
is greater than C<$b>.
