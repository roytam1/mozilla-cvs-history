query.cgi:
  Add --- to legal_resolution and target_milestone, why?

look for uses of make_popup
  -- it hasn't been modified yet

deal with processmail
  -- merge in use of Net::SMTP from redhat

deal with *.sh
  -- either take my table changes and integrate with existing scripts or kill and leave one big table creation script

see about new_comment
  -- it deals with its own data file, why?
