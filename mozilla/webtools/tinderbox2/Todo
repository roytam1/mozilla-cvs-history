The VC_Bonsai implementation does not work.  It is included only
because they will become important.  I do not understand the
interfaces well enought to finish the work and I have no means to test
them.

I have not coded the Image (fortune) system but I have left coding
hints as to how it would work.

I did not code a warnings system with all the warning pages (see
tinderbox1).

I did not code shownote.cgi to allow people who deploy the notice
board but do not have popup windows to see the notices.

I have not updated the client build scripts to work with the new system.

I need a Javascript expect to look over the current versions of CVS
Blame and Tinderbox1 and ensure that I have the best features of these
javascript programs in tinderbox2/src/lib/HTMLPopUp/MozillaLayers.pm.
Please keep the code neat and nicely indented.

I need to allow the VC system to have a daemon gather the VC
information and pass it to tinderbox via the same update methods wich
Builds uses. Then both the tinder.cgi and this new cvs process could
be run out of cron periodically and the webpages would not be delayed
if CVS takes a long time to respond this might improve the response
time of the web updates.  Also the OS process scheduler could do a
better job of scheduling if there were two different processes one
which was IO bound and one which was CPU bound.  

It would be really nice if could mail tinderbox the updates which
apply to the branches of interest, then tinderbox would not have to
pool and it would get the branch information which it needs.

I would like to show the set of bugs which have been closed during
each time period.  The CVS checkins are often being done to close bugs
it would be helpful to see what the bug numbers are and to have a
popup which shows the bug summary, who closed it, and other details.
It would also be handy to see which bugs have been reopened as these
indicate a problem with the development process.  There is no need to
display bugs which have been opened for the first time.  New bugs are
not related to development activities.
