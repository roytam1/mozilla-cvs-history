Release 0.8

Fix the Unmonitored Builds in admintree.cgi

Improve the prediction of when builds will end by introducing the
notion of 'deadtime'

Separate out the BuildStaus table for easier configuration of the
status without changing the build display library.

All executables are now taint safe

Improvments to the configuration script to taint support and to help
prevent accidental edit of files in the build or install directory.
