Release 0.8

Fix the Unmonitored Builds in admintree.cgi and in status.html page.

Storable.pm has been tested as a Persistence implementation.

Improve the prediction of when builds will end by introducing the
notion of 'deadtime'.

Separate out the BuildStaus table for easier configuration of the
status without changing the build display library.

Better security:

	All scripts run in taint perl mode

	Separation of HTML and DATA directories in 
		addition to the CGI directory

Improved Makefile/Configure support

	New permissions help prevent accidental edit of files in the
		build or install directory

	Interpositioning of libraries, for local configuration,
		fully supported

	Test arguments added to Makefile
