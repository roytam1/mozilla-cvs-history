Tinderbox Documentation
-----------------------

*) Every directory has a ReadMe file which tells about all the files
in that directory.

*) Every executable can be run with --help so that you can see what
the program does and what its arguments are.  If you have trouble
running the file just look at the file in a text editor and find
the string "usage".

*) The top of every file (both code and configuration) has a short
explanation of what this file does.

*) The code has lots of documentation so you can read the code if you
need more details about how something works.
