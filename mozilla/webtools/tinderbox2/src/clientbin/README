This directory contains example Tinderbox client scripts. These scripts are
for illustration/documentation purposes only and are not maintained
regularly. Current scripts to build mozilla will live in an another spot
in the mozilla tree.

Three examples have been provided:

mozilla-windows.pl: perl script that drives mozilla tinderbox builds for Win32
mozilla-unix.pl   : perl script that drives mozilla tinderbox builds for UNIX
build-moz-smoke.pl: perl script that drives mozilla tinderbox builds for UNIX,
	and subsequently runs the executable returning a green tree only if
	it does not crash.

These scripts show the basic elements of a Tinderbox client script. These
elements are:

1) Sending a start e-mail to the Tinderbox server, in the form of a formatted
mail message. Example:

tinderbox: tree: Mozilla
tinderbox: builddate: 900002087
tinderbox: status: building
tinderbox: build: IRIX 6.3 Depend
tinderbox: errorparser: unix
tinderbox: buildfamily: unix

2) Obtain a source tree by performing a cvs checkout.

3) Perform the build, saving the output to a log file.

4) Determine if the build was successful or failed. This could be done either
by checking for the presence of a binary, or being using error codes returned
from the compile command.

5) Send a completion message to Tinderbox, identifying build success or
failure.  Example:

tinderbox: tree: Mozilla
tinderbox: builddate: 900002087
tinderbox: status: success
tinderbox: build: IRIX 6.3 Depend
tinderbox: errorparser: unix
tinderbox: buildfamily: unix
