Synopsis


This cgi script will gunzip a file and send the result to standard out
in a form that a webserver can display.  Filenames are passed in via
an abreviated form.  It is assumed that all files are either brief or
full log files which are stored in known Tinderbox directories.  The
file id is the basename of the file without the '.gz.html' extension.
