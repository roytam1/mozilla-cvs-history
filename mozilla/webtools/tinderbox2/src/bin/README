All the Tinderbox2 executables are found in this directory.

The web server will only run programs which end in '.cgi'.  Programs
which begin with 'processmail' are run by the MTA whenever there is
new mail for that program. The Makefile will separate out the cgi
programs into a cgibins directory and put the other programs into a
bins directory.

For security you may wish to ensure that the two directories are
separated.


The programs in this directory:

  tinder.cgi
      The main program which generates all the static web pages
      which display the state of development.

  addnote.cgi
      The cgi program which allows users to create notes to be
      displayed on the notice board and tells tinder.cgi about
      the new data.

  admintree.cgi
      An administrative page for adding Messages of the Day
      or turning off various build columns.

  gunzip.cgi
      Uncompresses the HTML log files and sends them to the
      stdout so that the web server can display them.  It accepts
      log file discriptions in an abreiviated format so that URL's
      do not get too long.

  processmail_bugs
      The mail delivery agent which bug ticket mail will be processed.

  processmail_builds
      The mail delivery agent which build logs will be processed.

  processmail_null
      The mail delivery agent which throws away mail delivered to it.
      This is sometimes useful for debugging or maintenance tasks.

  rmlogs
      A script to be run via cron which will remove old log files
      from the disk so that it does not fill up.

  bustagestats.cgi
      Generates a "bustage" stats page (???)

  gifsize
      Adds HEIGHT= and WIDTH= to images referenced in specified HTML file.

  regenerate.cgi
      (???)
