# processmail_bugs - The 'bug tracking' mail processing engine for
# tinderbox.  The bug tracking server (bugzilla, aim, remedy, etc.)
# should send mail to the tinderbox server, when bug tickets change
# state. This program will parse the most common mail formats and and
# tell the tinderbox server about the the database column Vs value
# pairs.  This program should be run by the MTA (Sendmail,Fetchmail)
# when ever mail for the tinderboxs bugtracking mail account arrives.
# Tinderbox will display summary information about these tickets on
# the same page as the build and version control information.  This
# program should not need any local configuration.  All we assume is
# that the mail contains the name/value pairs on separate lines and
# that these are easy to parse out.  All configuration is done in the
# BTData.pm so that the display module (BT_Generic.pm) can display the
# information correclty.  The Bug Tracking modules are designed to be
# very flexible and work with any bug tracking system, they may
# require technical configurations.  No locks are used by the mail
# processes, data is passed to the tinderbox server in a maildir like
# format.

# Sample Bugzilla mail.
# notice that mail is a diff either -u or -c format

# There are other format that mail can be sent: "prettyasciimail",
# "newemailtech". I have not recieved any mail in these formats so I
# have not written a parser yet.

# The first example comes from redhat.com the second from bugzilla.org
# notice they use different diff settings.
