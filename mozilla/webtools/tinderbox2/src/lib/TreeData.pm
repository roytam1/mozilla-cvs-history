# TreeData.pm - the configuration file which describes the local VC
# repository data.  Only TinderDB::VC and VCDisplay know the
# datastructure contained in this file.  Other modules can only check
# if a string is a valid tree name or can get the list of all valid
# trees through funtional interfaces.  Also this file store the list
# of valid tree states.  The TreeState is used as an informational
# message only it does not directly effect the operation of the
# version control system. The TreeState is manipulated via the
# TinderHeader interface.

# This data used to be configurable via the treeadmin interface but we
# do not support that. The format of this data depends on the version
# control system in use and abstraction prevents treeadmin.cgi from
# knowing those details.  I may code a TreeData specific admin-CGI
# script in the future but I do not have time now and the benifits are
# not so clear.  For bonsai users it would be best if the DB stored
# the tree data.  The tinderbox server could download the data from a
# central place when it first starts up, and this download could
# trigger a registration for email updates of changes to any trees
# which this tinderbox server is monitoring. As long as the data is
# stored in a file, it is safer to have this data stored in VC in its
# own file, in case of problems.  The data tends to be technical
# enough that this file is managed by a Jr Sysadmin and they prefer a
# text editor with CVS to a CGI script and no records.  Also the
# client side build script needs to know how to checkout a tree and
# map tree names to what was checked out, so there is a communication
# issue to work out.

# Each tree is a map from a name to all the information necessary to
# do a checkout of the sources (in this case cvs repository to
# checkout, module, branch needed).  Tree names are used as parts of
# filenames so should not contain ' ' or '/' or unprintable
# characters.  You may need to change this datastructure if you do not
# use CVS.

# Who uses tree data?  

# Only the VCDisplay and TinderDB::VC know what the internal structure
# of the tree hash is.  All other modules only need to use the name of
# a valid tree.

# Also the client side build script needs to know how to checkout a
# tree.

# dir_pattern is a hack to get arround the fact that CVS does not
# always understand the module structure.  If we can discribe what is
# in the module using a perl pattern we can implement lost
# CVS functionality in perl.

# It may interest you to know we are currently using this format to
# build sets of locally developed libraries.  Each tree is really a
# set of CVS modules which need to be built in some order due to
# dependencies on the modules.  The build script knows how to do this.
# As far as tinderbox is concerned the tree is a single CVS module
# which checks out the whole set of modules.  The rest of development
# thinks of a tree as a set of modules.
