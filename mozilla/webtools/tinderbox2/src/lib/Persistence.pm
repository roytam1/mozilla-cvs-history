# Persistence - an abstract interface to save the data structures to
# disk and load the data back.  An effort is made to ensure files are
# updated atomically.  This interface allows us to easily change the
# perl module we use to store the data (Data::Dumper, Storable, etc).
# You will have choices between Data::Dumper which is slow but text
# files allows great debugging capabilities and Storable (not yet
# implemented) which is much faster but binary format.  testing is
# going into this function.  Data::Dumper module has an implicit eval
# and should not be used for securty sensitive uses.
