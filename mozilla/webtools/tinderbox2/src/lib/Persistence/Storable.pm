# Persistence::Storable.pm - A implementation of the Persistence API
# using Storable.  Storable is a commonly used Perl CPAN Module which
# writes/recovers perl datastructures to files using a binary format.
# This implemenation of Persistence should be faster than Dumper.pm
# but will be harder to debug Tinderbox if it is in use as it is not
# possible to read the data structures which are generated with a
# browser.

#    consistent with the storable interface.
