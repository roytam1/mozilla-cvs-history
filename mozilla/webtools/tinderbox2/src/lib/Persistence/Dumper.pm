# Persistence::Dumper.pm - A implementation of the Persistance API
# using Data::Dumper.  I suggest using this while debugging Tinderbox
# as the data structures can be viewed in a text editor or even
# modified by hand if need be. However, most of my cpu time during
# testing is going into this function.

# dprofpp says that:

#	%58.0 of user time which is 11.05 seconds 
#	(out of 19.03 User/102.15 Elapsed Seconds)
#	was spend in 32878 calls to Data::Dumper::_dump()
