# Persistence::Dumper.pm - A implementation of the Persistance API
# using Data::Dumper.  I suggest using this while debugging Tinderbox
# as the data structures can be viewed in a text editor or even
# modified by hand if need be. However, most of my cpu time during
# testing is going into this function.

# dprofpp says that:

#	%58.0 of user time which is 11.05 seconds 
#	(out of 19.03 User/102.15 Elapsed Seconds)
#	was spend in 32878 calls to Data::Dumper::_dump()

# The calling structure looks like the call for Storable because the
# arguments for that module are more strict then Data::Dumper.

#    $data: is a scalar (often a list of references to the data) which
#    contains the data we will save. We can only save scalars to be
#    consistant with the storable interface.

#    $data_file: The file where the data will be stored.

  # only eval this string to get back the data.  We pick the name of
  # the data to be '$r' so that load_structure will know what to
  # return.

 	       Data::Dumper->Dump([$data_refs], ["\$r"],).
