# VCDisplay::None - This is the implemenation to use if there is no
# means of displaying source code via the web.  The interface is
# highly influcenced by the Bonsai system using cvsblame cvsguess and
# cvsquery an we may need to generalize the interfaces in the future
# to accomidate more VC systems.
