# FileStructure.pm - The lookup for where different file/directories,

# administrator may need to put different trees onto different disk
# partitions and this will require making get_filename() less regular

# here is an idea for future use.  Currently EACH database has an
# atomic update and EACH html file is also updated the same way.  If
# we were careful with the choice of directories we could write our
# databases and HTML files into directories which were below a common
# root then update the root atomically.  Only one atomic update per
# run of tinderbox.  This would save a bunch of disk operations but
# reduce flexibility.



# I wish to do away with images.  They do not add much to the display
# and they make a bunch of clutter.
