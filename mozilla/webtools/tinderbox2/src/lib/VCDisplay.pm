# VCDisplay.pm - describes how tinderbox should prepeare URLS to
# show the source tree allow VC queries.  Currently there are two
# implementations one for users of the bonsai system (cvsquery,
# cvsguess, cvsblame) and one for users who have no web based access
# to their version control repository.  In the future I will make a
# VCDisplay module for CVSWeb.

# The function query creates HTTP links for SQL queries to the Version
# Control (VC) system.  The protype system that this works for is
# BONSAI the netscape database which is fed data from CVS.  The
# arguments to query are:

#    %args = (
#	     'tree' => Which VC tree this query applies to 
#	     'mindate' => The oldest time which should be considered
#	     'maxdate' => The most recent time which should be considered
#	     'who' => The VC name of the individual who checked in the change
#	     'linktxt' => The text to display on the link to the query
#	     'alt_linktxt' => Alternative text to display if there is no web 
#				 access to the VC system
#	     );
    

# The function guess creates HTTP links to the current version of a
# particular file at a specified line number.  This function is used
# when only the basename of the file is provided and some additional
# work must be done to figure out the file which was meant.  Most
# compilers only give the basename in their error messages and leave
# the determination of the directory to the user who is looking at the
# error log.

# arguments to guess are:

#    %args = (
#	     'tree' => Which VC tree this query applies to 
#	     'file' => The basename of the file to be displayed
#	     'line' => The line number of the file which is of interest, 
#                      some context above and below this line will be shown.
#	     'linktxt' => The text to display on the link to the query
#	     'alt_linktxt' => Alternative text to display if there is no web 
#				access to the VC system
#	     );
    

# The function source is used instead of guess when the full filename
# is know.  The arguments to guess and source are identical.  There is
# no code in tinderbox which uses this function.
