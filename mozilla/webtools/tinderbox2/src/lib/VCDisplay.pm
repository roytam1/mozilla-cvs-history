# VCDisplay.pm - describes how tinderbox should prepeare URLS to
# show the source tree allow VC queries.  Currently there are two
# implementations one for users of the bonsai system (cvsquery,
# cvsguess, cvsblame) and one for users who have no web based access
# to their version control repository.  In the future I will make a
# VCDisplay module for CVSWeb.
