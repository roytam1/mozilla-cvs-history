# TinderDB::VC_Bonsai - methods to query the bonsai interface to CVS
# Version Control system and find the users who have checked changes
# into the tree recently and renders this information into HTML for
# the status page.  This module depends on TreeData and is one of the
# few which can see its internal datastructures.  The
# TinderHeader::TreeState is queried so that users will be displayed
# in the color which represents the state of the tree at the time they
# checked their code in.  This module uses the library BonsaiData.pm
# to provide an abstract programatic interface to Bonsai.  We assume
# that the Bonsai tree names are the same as the Tinderbox tree names.
# This module is very similar to VC_CVS and the two files should be
# kept in sync.

# the Bonsai (Mozilla.org's SQL interface to CVS) implemenation of the
# Version Control DB for Tinderbox.  This column of the status table
# will report who has changed files in the CVS repository and what
# files they have changed.

# Remember CVS does all its work in GMT (UCT), Tinderbox does all its work in
# local time.  Thus this file needs to perform the conversions.



#   We store the hash of all names who modified the tree at a
#   particular time as follows:

#   $DATABASE{$tree}{$time}{'author'}{$author}{$file} = $log;

# additionally information about changes in the tree state are stored
# in the variable:

#   $DATABASE{$tree}{$time}{'treestate'} = $state;

# we also store information in the metadata structure

#   $METADATA{$tree}{'updates_since_trim'} += 1;
#
# where state is either 'Open' or 'Closed' or some other user defined string.
#
# Cell colors are controled by the functions:
#	TreeData::get_all_tree_states()
#	TreeData::TreeState2color($state)
