# TinderDB::VC_Perforce - methods to query the Perforce Version
# Control system and find the users who have checked changes into the
# tree recently and renders this information into HTML for the status
# page.  This module depends on TreeData and is one of the few which
# can see its internal datastructures.  

# The TinderHeader::TreeState is queried so that users will be
# displayed in the color which represents the state of the tree at the
# time they checked their code in.  Ideally Perforce should have a
# notion of tree state so that when the development tree is in a
# restricted state the developers find that their ability to checkin
# is restricted as well.  For example when the tree is 'closed' no
# developer should be able to check in however QA and the Project
# Managment team should be able to allow indivual developers to check
# in code on a case by case basis.  The security model in Perforce
# does not make such regular changes to the security tables
# perticularly easy or safe to be performed by so many people.

# The only perforce command this module runs is:
#
#		 'p4 describe -s $num'
#
# This means that tinderbox needs to run as a user which has Perforce
# 'list' privileges.

# Tinderbox works on the notion of "tree" which is a set of
# directories (under a particular branch).  Perforce has no easily
# identifiable analog.  We would like to query Perforce about changes
# only to the set of files which concerns us.  It is not clear if the
# filespec can be used with the 'describe -s' command to limit the
# information reported about about a change set.

# We had similar problems with CVS so we create this notion in
# Tinderbox using the variables
# $TreeData::VC_TREE{$tree}{'dir_pattern'} which define regular
# expressions of file names.  There must be at least one file in the
# change set which matches the dir pattern for us to assume that this
# change set applies to this tree.  If not we ignore the change set.

# This is not implemented yet since we have no experiance with what is
# needed but some ideas are left in the code, commented out, so that
# we can work with them later.

# The Perforce implemenation of the Version Control DB for Tinderbox.
# This column of the status table will report who has changed files in
# the Perforce Depot and what files they have changed.



#  We store the hash of all names who modified the tree at a
#  particular time as follows:

#  $DATABASE{$tree}{$time}{'author'}{$author} = 
#            [\@affected_files, \@jobs_fixed, $change_num];

# Where each element of @affected_files looks like
#	 [$filename, $revision, $action, $comment];
#
# This was extracted from perforce data which looked like
#         ... //depot/filename#32 edit

# Where each element of @jobs_fixed, looks like
#         [$jobname, $author, $status, $comment];
#
# This was extracted from perforce data which looked like
# 		job000001 on 2001/05/27 by ken *closed*


# we also store information in the metadata structure

#   $METADATA{$tree}{'updates_since_trim'} += 1;
#

#  we remember which change sets we have information about and what we
#  will need to be quired to get new data.
#
#  $METADATA{$tree}{'next_change_num'});
#

# additionally information about changes in the tree state are stored
# in the variable:

#   $DATABASE{$tree}{$time}{'treestate'} = $state;

#
# where state is either 'Open' or 'Closed' or some other user defined string.
#
# Cell colors are controled by the functions:
#	TreeData::get_all_sorted_tree_states()
#	TreeData::TreeState2color($state)
#	TreeData::TreeState2char($state)
