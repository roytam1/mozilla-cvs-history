# We want to allow users to embed links and other HTML into their
# comments BUT we must filter user input to prevent this:

# http://www.ciac.org/ciac/bulletins/k-021.shtml

#   When a victim with scripts enabled in their browser reads this
#   message, the malicious code may be executed
#   unexpectedly. Scripting tags that can be embedded in this way
#   include <SCRIPT>, <OBJECT>, <APPLET>, and <EMBED>.

# note that since we want some tags to be allowed (href) but not
# others.  This requirement breaks the taint perl mechanisms for
# checking as we can not escape every '<>'.

# the data is stored as:
#  $DATABASE{$tree}{$time}{$author} = $message;
#  $METADATA{$tree}{'updates_since_trim'}+= 1

# where each $message has the required fields:

#	$record->{'time'} # the time the notice was posted in time() format
#	$record->{'mailaddr'} # the mail address of the user who posed the notice
#	$record->{'rendered_notice'}; # the notice in a HTML displayble format

# currently addnote.cgi saves additional debug information in these not
# used fields:

#	$record->{'tree'}  # the name of the tree this notice appiles to
#	$record->{'notice'} # the raw text of the notice
#	$record->{'localtime'} # the time as a user viewable string
