# To help preserve the database in the event of a serious system
# problem we save the database to a different file name then change
# the name of the file to the database file name.  This allows us to
# recover from a program crash during the save operation since we
# always have at least one copy of the data around.

  # In the future we may wish to put the tree name, a reference to the
  # database and a reference to the metadata into the object but this
  # would make it harder to push into @TinderDB::HTML_COLUMNS at
  # compile time AND this a GLOBAL list of implementations to use so
  # needs to be kept clear of tree specific data.  How to connect the
  # object returned by TinderDB::loadtree_db($tree) with the object
  # used by TinderDB::Build::loadtree_db($tree) is not clear to me, we
  # would loose much of the simplicity of the wrappers with strange
  # calling sequences. Also now the TinderDB object is quite complex
  # it needs to be indexed by: module, tree, value.  The build module
  # uses the fact that STATUS can be peeked at when the TinderDB
  # object is not around.
