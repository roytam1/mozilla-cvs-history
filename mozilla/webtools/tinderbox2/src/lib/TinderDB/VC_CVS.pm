# TinderDB::VC_CVS - methods to query the (raw) CVS Version Control
# system and find the users who have checked changes into the tree
# recently and renders this information into HTML for the status page.
# This module depends on TreeData.  The TinderHeader::TreeState is
# queried so that users will be displayed in the color which
# represents the state of the tree at the time they checked their code
# in.  If you are using bonsai you should not use this module, use
# TinderDB::VC_Bonsai instead.

package TinderDB::VC_CVS;

# the raw CVS implemenation of the Version Control DB for Tinderbox.
# This column of the status table will report who has changed files in
# the CVS repository and what files they have changed.

# Remember CVS does all its work in GMT (UCT), Tinderbox does all its work in
# local time.  Thus this file needs to perform the conversions.

# The 'cvs history' command does not give correct info about
# modifications to the repository (types= 'ARM') when passed a module
# name, it was only designed to work on individual files.  If you use
# the -m option you will not find any info about checkins. We leave
# off the module name and take the info for the whole repository
# instead. If this becomes a bother we can reject information about
# updates which do not match a pattern.  In this respect the pattern
# becomes a proxy for the module.  The pattern is stored in
# $TreeData::VC_TREE{$tree}{'dir_pattern'}.  

# There is nothing I can think of to get information about which
# branch the changes were checked in on.  The history command also has
# no notion of branches, but that is a common problem with the way CVS
# does branching anyway.

# What we really want it the checkin comments but history does not
# give us that information and it would be too expensive to run cvs
# again for each file.  The file name is good enough but other VC
# implementations should use the checkin comments if availible.

#   We store the hash of all names who modified the tree at a
#   particular time as follows:

#   $DATABASE{$tree}{$time}{'author'}{$author}{$file} = 1;

# additionally information about changes in the tree state are stored
# in the variable:

#   $DATABASE{$tree}{$time}{'treestate'} = $state;

# we also store information in the metadata structure

#   $METADATA{$tree}{'updates_since_trim'} += 1;
#
# where state is either 'Open' or 'Closed' or some other user defined string.
#
# Cell colors are controled by the functions:
#	TreeData::get_all_tree_states()
#	TreeData::TreeState2color($state)


# Most of the real time for the tinder.cgi process is waiting for CVS
# to tell us about the history.  

# dprofpp says that:
#	 %64.8 of real time which is 66.25 seconds out of 102.15 Seconds
#	 was spent in 3 calls to TinderDB::VC::apply_db_updates()

# It may be a good idea to separate this out into a different process.
# We may want to have a process which gets the history data and passes
# it to tinder.cgi via the same type of updates as the build accepts.
# Then both the tinder.cgi and this new cvs process could be run out
# of cron periodically and the webpages would not be delayed if CVS
# takes a long time to respond this might improve the response time of
# the web updates.  Also the OS process scheduler could do a better
# job of scheduling if there were two different processes one which
# was IO bound and one which was CPU bound.  A separate CVS process
# may improve the quality of the output the cvs info page says that
# there is an option `-w'

#     Show only the records for modifications done from the same
#     working directory where `history' is executing.

# I sugest making the separation a configurable option so some users
# can have VC_CVS run in push mode and others in pull mode.

# It would even be better if bonsai could be convinced set up a
# subscription service for trees.  Then Bonsai could mail tinderbox
# the updates which apply to the branches of interest and tinderbox
# would not have to pool and it would get the branch information which
# it needs.
