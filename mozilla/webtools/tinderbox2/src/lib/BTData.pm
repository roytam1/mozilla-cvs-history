# Some AIM variable names have spaces in them, we will conert these

# the product product types listed in the bug tracking data base
# refers to one development project except for a particular
# feature/platform of one particular project which is being developed
# by a separate group of developers.  So the version control notion of
# tress (a set of modules on a branch) may not have a direct map into
# the bug tracking database at all times.

# This function should return 'undef' if the bug report should be
