# Each tree is a map from a name to all the information necessary to
# do a checkout of the sources (in this case cvs repository to
# checkout, module, branch needed) and to create a URL to display the
# page (if such a means exists).  Tree names are used as parts of
# filenames so should not contain ' ' or '/' or unprintable
# characters.  You may need to change this datastructure if you do not
# use CVS.

# Who uses tree data?

# Only the VCDisplay and TinderDB::VC know what the internal structure
# of the tree hash is.  All other modules only need to use the name of
# a valid tree.

# Also the client side build script needs to know how to checkout a
# tree.
