# This package is used for configuring the Generic Bug Tracking system
# module.  I belive that this will handle most bug tracking systems.
# We assume that bugs are stored in a database (each bug has a known
# list of field names) and that a subset of the fields will be of
# interest to the tinderbox users (tinderbox is not the correct place
# to display any sort of long comment field).  Tinderbox will display
# the bug number and a popup window showing relevant fields discribing
# this bug.  If the users wishes more information they may click on
# the link and be taken directly to the bugtracking system for more
# information about the bug.  Bugs have their state change as the bug
# is worked on and users of tinderbox wish to see information about
# the bug as the state changes.  We divide state changes into two
# types: 'Progress', 'Slippage'. Most important is to get a feel for
# the number of bugs which move into bad/backward states ('REOPENED').

# Users will certainly need to configure the tables in this module for
# their needs. Additionally users need to define how to convert
# information about each bug to the correct tinderbox tree that this
# bug belongs.  This is handled by defining the update2tree() function
# as appropriate.

# This package must not use any tinderbox specific libraries.  It is

# like.  If you wish to indicate that certain states are possible but

# Given a pointer to a bug update hash, return the name of the tree to
# which this bug report belongs.  Typically this will be the contents
# of a field like 'Product', (if you have one tinderbox page for each
# product in your bug database) however some projects may be more
# compicated.  

# One example of a complex function to determine tree name would be if
# each of the product product types listed in the bug tracking data
# base refers to one development project, except for a particular
# feature/platform of one particular project which is being developed
# by a separate group of developers.  So the version control notion of
# trees (a set of modules on a branch) may not have a direct map into
# the bug tracking database at all times.

# This function should return the null list '()' if the bug report
# should be ignored by the tinderbox server.  The function returns a
# list of trees which should display the data about this bug update.
