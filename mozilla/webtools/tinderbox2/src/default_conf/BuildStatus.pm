# BuildStatus.pm - the definitions of the various types of build
# results and what action should be taken with each result.  Users can
# customize their tinderbox to call pagers when certain events happen
# or change the names/colors of the build events.

package BuildStatus;


# This package must not use any tinderbox specific libraries.  It is
# intended to be a base class.


# for each Build status we have:

# color: to display it in on the buildpage
# handler: to execute actions each time the status is reported.
# description: to put in the legend
# order: to show us the how well this build did compared with other builds, 
#	bigger numbers means more progress

# The Tinderbox code should not depend on the set of status values in
# case we need to add more types later.

# possible new types include: unit-test-failed,
# perforance-test-failed, coverage-failed, lint-failed

# The Tinderbox code only hardcodes the values of: 'not_running',
# 'building' to determine if the build in question has completed and
# 'success' to dertermine if the build finished all that it was
# intended to do.  The various gradations of failure are not tracked
# inside tinerbox but are useful for project managment.


# If new types are added, try and keep to a small set of colors or the
# display will get confusing.  You may find it convienent to keep a
# distinction between different kinds of warnings or different kinds
# of tests but we suggest keeping all warnings and all tests get the
# same color.

# Each time a build update is sent to the tinderbox server, a handler
# function is run.  This allows the local administrator to specify an
# arbitrary action to take each time a particular status is reported.

# This handler could be used to open a trouble ticket each time the
# build fails.  There could be a new web page where developers could
# request notification (email, page) when the next build is done.
# This would allow developers to not watch the tinderbox webpage so
# intently but be informed when an interesting change has occured.

# Please send us interesting uses for the handler.  We would like to
# make examples available.
