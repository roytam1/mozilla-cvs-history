AUS Sanity Checking
-------------------
This directory shouldn't be sitting out running in production.

Use it to generate some informal tests and reports and compare output of different AUS sources.

Usage:
    * Add tests to sanity.ini
    * Generate controls
    * Compare controls (usually taken from prod) against other results (staging, dev, etc.)
