AUS Acceptance Tests
====================

The purpose of this set of documents is to verify behavior of AUS by
testing all possible inputs and outputs for expected outcomes.

Required Tools
==============

The aus XML generation code found in mozilla/webtools/aus/xml
    PHP
    Apache w/ ModRewrite
The data directory found here, to be used as a synthetic build data source
PyFit: http://www.python.org/pypi/PyFit
FitNesse: http://fitnesse.org/FitNesse.DownLoad
JRE 1.5: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/

Setup
=====

AUS XML

    Check out the current mozilla/webtools/aus/xml (or the tag you want to test)
    Set it up, following the README
    Use the data directory in mozilla/webtools/aus/tests/data as it's datasource

PyFit and FitNesse

   python setup.py install for PyFit
   ./run.sh in fitnesse directory -- assuming you have it pointing to the right java, you're good to go
   you may need to do ./run.sh -p 8080 if port 80 is already taken

Using FitNesse

    Create a new wiki page that is runnable
        go to http://localhose:8080/VerifyAUS
        copy-paste Verify.txt in there
        adjust your TEST_RUNNER path to point to the PyFit directory (mine will be wrong, since it's a mac)
        go to properties, and check [x] test to make it a runnable page

    Set up the PyFit test module in your PyFit/fit directory
        go to your PyFit/fit directory
        create a diretory named 'aus' in your PyFit/fit/ directory
        move Verify.py into your aus directory
        put Feedparser in the same directory as Verify.py (http://feedparser.org/)
        touch __init__.py in the aus directory (PyFit needs this, apparently) 

    Running the test
        click on "Test"
        If your host is pointing to your AUS XML install, you should be good to go

Feedparser




Troubleshooting
===============

Did you copy config-dist.php -> config.php for the AUS XML stuff?
Does your server have the right rewrite for AUS XML?  See htaccess.dist.
FixtureRenames error?  Go to FitNess home directory and "touch FixtureRenames.txt" to fix.
Python is barfing?  Make sure you have Feedparser somewhere.
Stuck? Talk to morgamic in IRC.
