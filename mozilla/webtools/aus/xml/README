AUS2 Installation
------------
Copy ./inc/config-dist.php to ./inc/config.php.  Configure it properly following the comments.
Set up the ./data symlink to point to the right location (/opt/aus2/incoming, for example).
Referencing ./ with the right parameters will get you the correct XML file.

NOTE: source files must follow a naming convention:
    SOURCE_DIR/[product]/[platform]/[locale].txt

NOTE: adjust the .htaccess file's RewriteBase if you are having problems.
