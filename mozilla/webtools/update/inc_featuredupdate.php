<SPAN class="itemdescription">
<P>The Firefox 1.0 Preview Release is now available. Three large new features - Live Bookmarks, the Find bar and a new plugin
installer - have landed since 0.9, along with a host of critical bugfixes.</P>

<P>Mozilla Thunderbird 0.8 has just been released! This latest milestone adds a frequently requested feature: support for
filtering all POP mail into a Global Inbox under Local Folders. In addition, this release sees the debut of
Thunderbird's support for RSS and Atom feeds. Users can set up an RSS News & Blogs account and then subscribe to feeds
from their favourite news sites and weblogs. Each feed appears as a folder with each individual item appearing as a message.</P>
