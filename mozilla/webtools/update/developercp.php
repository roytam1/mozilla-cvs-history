By Firefox 1.0, Mozilla Update will have a new section for Extension/Theme authors to login to. This new section
will give them the ability to manage their extensions and themes that're hosted on Mozilla Update themselves.<BR>
<BR>
Authors will have the ability to add a new extension or theme themselves, as well as adding new versions of that extension or theme,
updating an existing listing (including being able to change the application-compatibility settings w/o needing a new file), and if
they so desire, the ability to remove entirely an old version of an extension or theme or the entire listing.<BR>
<BR>
Other features that will be available include the capability of adding and managing preview images of their extension or theme,
a developer comments feature, so they can easily communicate to end-users known problems with the extension/theme.
