Firefox Survey Readme


Description
-----------
This is a small application that accepts a name and email address after
captcha verification, and emails the entered address with a link.  It's
a pretty specific app for the Firefox Survey.


Requirements
------------
- Cake libraries installed on the server
- GD libraries installed on the server (if images don't show up, your best bet
  is to look at the configuration in the captcha lib in /vendors/captcha/)


To Install
----------
1) Copy config/database.php.default to database.php and fill out appropriate
values.

2) Copy config/defines.php.default to defines.php and fill out appropriate
values.

3) Run config/sql/init.php

4) If the app isn't installed on the root of the webserver (ie. it's in
http://server.com/folder and not just http://server.com/) you may have to add
RewriteBase rules to /.htaccess and /webroot/.htaccess


Testing (Verification everything works)
---------------------------------------
1) Load / in a browser
    * Page should have standard rustico look/feel
    * There should be a captcha image in between the 3rd and 4th input box
2) Click "Send" with all boxes empty
    * A red message should appear reminding the user to enter the captcha code.
3) Fill in all input boxes.
    * A thank you message should appear
    * An email should be sent to the entered email address
        * Should be from "Firefox Surveys"
        * Reply-to should be "nobody@mozilla.com"
        * Should have 3 html links
4) Return to / and fill in all input boxes with the same information
    * A message should appear saying you've already signed up for the survey
    * An email should be sent to the entered email address (same email as above)
