To use Doctor, first configure it by copying sample.conf to doctor.conf
and editing doctor.conf according to the instructions in it.

Then download and install the IO::Capture module from the net:

http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=yr0e8.12924%24ZC3.1033373%40newsread2.prod.itd.earthlink.net

You can install it anywhere in the Perl path; I installed it in the doctor
root directory at IO/Capture.pm.

Finally, put the doctor directory into your web server's cgi-bin directory
(or another location where you can run CGI scripts) and browse to doctor.cgi.

You may also want to edit the templates in the templates/ sub-directory
to refer to your own site instead of mozilla.org's.
