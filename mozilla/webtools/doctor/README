To use Doctor, first configure it by copying sample.conf to doctor.conf
and editing doctor.conf according to the instructions in it.

Then make sure you have the Template, AppConfig, File::Temp, Text::Diff,
Email::Valid, and MIME::Entity modules (and their dependencies), which you
can get via CPAN:

perl -MCPAN -e"install Template, AppConfig, File::Temp, Text::Diff, Email::Valid, and MIME::Entity"

Finally, put the doctor directory into your web server's cgi-bin directory
(or another location where you can run CGI scripts) and browse to doctor.cgi.

You may also want to edit the templates in the templates/ sub-directory
to refer to your own site instead of mozilla.org's.

Note that doctor.conf may contain a CVS write password you don't want anyone
to know.  The .htaccess file restricts access to that file for Apache
if this feature is enabled in .htaccess files.  Check and make sure!
