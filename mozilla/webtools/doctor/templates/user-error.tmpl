    <h1>Doctor - [% title %]</h1>
    
    <p>
      Doctor couldn't process your request because of the following problem:
    </p>
    
    <p><big><b>[% message %]</b></big></p>
    
    [% IF cvs_error_code %]
      <p>
        The problem occurred when Doctor tried to execute the CVS command:
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>[% cvs_command FILTER html %]</em>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        CVS returned the error code <em>[% cvs_error_code %]</em> and the message:
      </p>

      <pre>[% cvs_error_message FILTER html %]</pre>
    [% END %]
    
    <p>
      Please go back and try again.
