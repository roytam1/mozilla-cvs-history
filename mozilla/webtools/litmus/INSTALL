===Litmus Installation Instructions===

First of all, let me convince you that you in fact probbaly do not want
to install Litmus. Litmus is not 1.0 software. Litmus is not even 0.5
software. In fact, Litmus doesn't really do any of the things you would
expect it to do yet.

In summary, if you're not looking to install Litmus because you are or
want to be a Litmus developer, you'd best turn around and go back from
whence you came.

If at any point you find that you don't understand these installation
instructions, it's a good sign you want to turn back as well.

Required Perl Modules: 
Class::DBI 
Class::DBI::mysql 
Template 
Time::Piece 
Time::Piece::mysql 
Time::Seconds
Date::Manip
HTML::StripScripts
HTML::StripScripts::Parser
Text::Markdown
XML::XPath

Once you've got everything installed, run: mysql < createdb.sql to
create the Litmus database.

Then edit Litmus/Config.pm to give it the information it needs to
connect to the database.

Run ./populatedb.pl to create products, testgroups, subgroups, etc...
There is no UI at present for doing this.

Edit the newly created 'localconfig' file and provide your database 
configuration. 

Then just pop the whole thing into a directory where your web server can
get at it. Have fun!

Note: After upgrading Litmus, it's a good idea to run populatedb.pl
again to pick up any schema changes that may have occured.
