== Setting up the database ==

If this is your first time installing Litmus, you'll want to
run populatedb.pl with the "-r" option. This will populate some of the lookup
tables with sensible defaults (which you can adjust later, if necessary) that
will allow you to start using Litmus right away.

  cd litmus
  ./populatedb.pl -r

The populatedb.pl script will also create a template configuration file, 
'localconfig,' that contains variables to hold your database configuration 
information. Edit the newly created 'localconfig' file with your database 
configuration. Once 'localconfig' is populated with your database information, 
run the populatedb.pl again to populate the initial products, locales, etc... 
There is no UI at present for doing this.

  vi localconfig
  ./populatedb.pl -r

Then just pop the whole thing into a directory where your web server can
get at it. Have fun!

== Creating the first admin user ==

To get yourself an administrator account, you'll need to load up Litmus in your 
web browser and follow the link to create a new account. You'll have been 
lucky enough to score user id number 1. Grant yourself admin rights by loading 
up mysql, connecting to your Litmus database, and running the following command:

 mysql -u litmus -p litmus
 mysql> insert into user_group_map values ('1', '1');

From there, you can go into "Edit Users" in the web interface and grant 
rights to any new users. 

== Sending mail from Litmus ==

Sendmail (or a mailer with a compatible command-line interface) is required if
you want Litmus to be able to send email, e.g. for daily reports. If you will
be using something other than sendmail, you may need to change Litmus::Mailer
appropriately.

== Things to do after an upgrade ==

After upgrading Litmus from CVS, it's a good idea to run populatedb.pl again to
pick up any schema changes that may have occured.
