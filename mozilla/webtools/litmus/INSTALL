interface) is required.

== Setting up the database ==

Run populatedb.pl. This will create a template configuration file, 
'localconfig,' that contains variables to hold your database configuration 
information. Edit the newly created 'localconfig' file with your database 
configuration. Once 'localconfig' is populated with your database information, 
run the populatedb.pl again to populate the initial products, locales, etc... 
There is no UI at present for doing this.

Then just pop the whole thing into a directory where your web server can
get at it. Have fun!

To get yourself an administrator account, you'll need to load up Litmus in your 
web browser and follow the link to create a new account. You'll have been 
lucky enough to score user id number 1. Grant yourself admin rights by loading 
up mysql, connecting to your Litmus database, and running the following command:

  insert into user_group_map values ('1', '1');

From there, you can go into "Edit Users" in the web interface and grant 
rights to any new users. 

Note: After upgrading Litmus, it's a good idea to run populatedb.pl
again to pick up any schema changes that may have occured.

== Creating the first admin user ==

Click 'Log In' and create a new Litmus account. In the database, set 'is_admin' = 1 for the new user in the users table. That user will now have access to the admin functions of Litmus through the web interface.
