===Litmus Installation Instructions===

First of all, let me convince you that you in fact probbaly do not want
to install Litmus. Litmus is not 1.0 software. Litmus is not even 0.5
software. In fact, Litmus doesn't really do any of the things you would
expect it to do yet.

In summary, if you're not looking to install Litmus because you are or
want to be a Litmus developer, you'd best turn around and go back from
whence you came.

If at any point you find that you don't understand these installation
instructions, it's a good sign you want to turn back as well.

Required Perl Modules:

Apache::DBI
CGI
Class::DBI 
Class::DBI::mysql 
Data::Dumper
Data::JavaScript
Date::Manip
File::Find
Getopt::Long;
HTML::StripScripts
HTML::StripScripts::Parser
JSON
Sys::Hostname
Template 
Test::Harness
Text::Markdown
Time::HiRes
Time::Piece 
Time::Piece::MySQL 
Time::Seconds
XML::XPath

First edit Litmus/Config.pm to give it the information it needs to
connect to the database.

Run populatedb.pl. This will create a template configuration file, 'localconfig,' that contains variables to hold your database configuration information. Edit the newly created 'localconfig' file with your database configuration. Once 'localconfig' is populated with your database information, run the populatedb.pl again to populate the initial products, locales, etc... There is no UI at present for doing this.

Then just pop the whole thing into a directory where your web server can
get at it. Have fun!

Note: After upgrading Litmus, it's a good idea to run populatedb.pl
again to pick up any schema changes that may have occured.
