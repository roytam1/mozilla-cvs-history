== Setting up the database ==

Run populatedb.pl. This will create a template configuration file, 'localconfig,' that contains variables to hold your database configuration information. Edit the newly created 'localconfig' file with your database configuration. Once 'localconfig' is populated with your database information, run the populatedb.pl again to populate the initial products, locales, etc... There is no UI at present for doing this. 

Then just pop the whole thing into a directory where your web server can
get at it. Have fun!

Note: After upgrading Litmus, it's a good idea to run populatedb.pl
again to pick up any schema changes that may have occured.

== Creating the first admin user ==

Click 'Log In' and create a new Litmus account. In the database, set 'is_admin' = 1 for the new user in the users table. That user will now have access to the admin functions of Litmus through the web interface.
