===Litmus===

If you're reading this, you've downloaded, received, or simply conjured
out of thin air, a copy of the Litmus testcase management system.
Presumably, you're reading this file because you have some sort of
question about Litmus. Hopefully, if we've done our job right, this file
ought to answer your questions. 

Q: What is Litmus?
A: Litmus is a testcase management system. Its goal is to allow users to
enter software tests, run them, and view and manage the results. Along
the way, users can expect to be able to do queries and reports and have
access all the usual features they expect from a first-class web
application. The reality may be somewhat different than this goal.
Litmus is developed by mozilla.org.  

Q: How do I install this dang thing?
A: You probably want the file called INSTALL.

Q: Where is the real documentation?
A: Hahahaha. What is this "documentation" you speak of? You might want
to check out the Litmus Wiki, which may or may not contain useful
information. See http://wiki.mozilla.org/Litmus.

Q: What needs to be done?
A: See http://wiki.mozilla.org/Litmus:Todo

Q: How much does it cost?
A: Nothing. Litmus is Free Software, licensed under the Mozilla Public
License.

Q: Wait. Isn't "testcase" two words? 
A: Not here it isn't. 

Q: Waaaaaaah. Why is Litmus written in Perl and not
PHP/Python/Java/Objective Pascal/Latin?
A: Because I know Perl. Duh. Also because Litmus uses some code from
Bugzilla, and it wouldn't be able to do this if it was written in some
other language. Camels are also some of the least buggy animals around,
as they swat flies away with their tails. 

Q: I'm still confused. You didn't answer my question. I don't know what
to do. Help!
A: First of all, that's not a question. In any case, your best bet is
probably to email Zach Lipton <zach@zachlipton.com>, and if you ask
nicely and don't make too much of a pest of yourself, he'd be glad to
get you on the right track.
