  var formattingHelpText = '<p>To make it easier to edit testcase data, Litmus uses the <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown text formatting engine.</a> Markdown makes it easy to create paragraphs, numbered and bulleted lists, and other formatted text in testcases.. The formatter works in addition to standard HTML, which means that you can still use normal HTML tags instead of, or in addition to, Markdown formatting. While you can read <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">a complete description of Markdown\'s syntax</a>, the basic tips below should cover most common needs:</p><ul><li><b>Paragraphs:</b> Creating new paragraphs is easy. Just leave a blank line between each paragraph, and Litmus will add the &lt;p&gt; tags for you. Any special characters you use will automatically be escaped.</li><li><b>Lists:</b> To create a <b>bulleted list</b>, add asterisks before each item:<br>  * First item<br>  * Second item<br>To create a <b>numbered list</b>, just put numbers before each item:<br>  1. First item<br>  2. Second item<br>Litmus will automatically generate the proper html for the list display.</li><li><b>Links:</b> Creating links is easy too. You can use traditional &lt;a href=""&gt; formatting, or the simplified syntax: [link text](http://the.url.com). Or you can use the really simple syntax: &lt;the.url.com&gt;.</li><li><b>Text Formatting:</b> Simple text formatting, such as bold and italics, can be done with html tags, or as follows:<br><b>Italics:</b> *text*<br><b>Bold:</b> **text**</li></ul>';
