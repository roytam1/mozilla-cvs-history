<p>The testing coverage percentages are based on Platform (Windows, Mac, Linux) and Build ID. Since the Build ID is datestamp-based, this should mean that there are always some tests that need running if you update to the latest nightly build.</p>

<p>While we appreciate all testing efforts, it is more helpful if you select a testing group or subgroup for testing that does not already have complete testing coverage by the community.</p>

<p>Please note that groups/subgroups that you have already tested in their entirety (100%) are not selectable.</p>

<p>If there are problems with an existing test result that you have submitted (e.g. invalid status), please add a comment to the test result in question.</p>
