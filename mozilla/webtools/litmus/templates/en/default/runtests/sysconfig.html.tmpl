<td>PRIVACY NOTICE: Like Bugzilla, Litmus is an open system. All testing results you file will be visible to the public, including the email addresses of those involved. Although steps are taken to hide addresses from email harvesters, the spammers are continually getting better technology and it is almost guaranteed that the address you use with Litmus will get spam. We recommend using a free web email service (such as Yahoo or Hotmail or similar) and not your primary email address if this concerns you. There are solutions being worked on to allow you to hide your email address from other users, but that option is not yet available.
