The files in this directory are part of the PLIF test appliaction, the
precursor to Bugzilla3.

Note: To test this on Apache, make a symlink called "nph-Main" and
point it to the file "Main".

You will also then want to create a .htaccess file containing
something like the following:


# set up the CGI scripts without .cgi extensions
<files nph-Main>
   SetHandler cgi-script
</files>

# set up the stylesheets without .css extensions
<files style>
   ForceType text/css
</files>

# describe the files
AddDescription "The main part of the PLIF test app" nph-Main

# SECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /libraries/perl/PLIF/tests/
ReWriteRule .? - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:AUTHORIZATION},PT]
