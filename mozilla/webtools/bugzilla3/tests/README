The files in this directory are part of the PLIF test appliaction, the
precursor to Bugzilla3.

Note: To test this on Apache, make a symlink called "nph-Main" and
point it to the file "Main".

You will also then want to create a .htaccess file containing
something like the following:

--------------------------------------8<--------------------------------------
# set up the CGI scripts without .cgi extensions
<files nph-Main>
   SetHandler cgi-script
</files>

# set up the stylesheets without .css extensions
<files style>
   ForceType text/css
</files>

# describe the files
AddDescription "The main part of the PLIF test app" nph-Main

# SECURITY_HOLE_PASS_AUTHORIZATION
RewriteEngine on
RewriteBase /libraries/perl/PLIF/tests/
ReWriteRule .? - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:AUTHORIZATION},PT]
--------------------------------------8<--------------------------------------

You will also want to make sure that Options +ExecCGI is enabled in
the directory containing nph-Main and that the directory is not
writable by others (drwxr-xr-x).

Finally, if you are using suexec then it won't be able to stat a
symlink to Main, so delete the symlink, rename Main to nph-Main, and
then create a symlink Main that points to nph-Main.
