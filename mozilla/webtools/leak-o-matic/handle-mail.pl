# ``sendmail'' handler to receive data on the server. Cooperates with
# ``make-data.pl'', the data collection script.
#
# To use, create an account on your server; e.g., "leak-o-matic", that
# will receive mail from the data collector. In this account's home
# directory, create a .forward file that containes the following
#
# "|handle-mail.pl --datadir=whatever"
#
# Yes, the quotes are important. Depending on your sendmail
# configuration, you may need to place the ``handle-mail.pl'' script
# in a special directory; e.g., /etc/smrsh on a vanilla RH6.0 system.
