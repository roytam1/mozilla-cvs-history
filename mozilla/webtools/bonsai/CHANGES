will tell you what has been changed in the last week.



7/9/99 Ported completely to perl!  (Due to heroic efforts by Dieter
Weber <dieter@Compatible.COM>).  Among the things you need to do to
get this to work are:

	- Realize that this installation will clear the "hook", and will
	  prevent you from seeing any old hooks that were created by the old
	  TCL code.
	- Create a treeconfig.pl, based on the tree data in your old
	  (now obsolete) configdata.
	- Make sure your perl contains the MailDate and libnet CPAN modules
	  (see INSTALL for how to get these)
	- Add a new column to the descs table (Dieter added this to speedup
	  database rebuilds).  Feed this to mysql:

		alter table descs add column hash bigint not null;

	- Go visit the new editparams.cgi page, and adjust everything.
	- Change your mail alias to point to the new handleCheckinMail.pl
	  script (instead of handleCheckinMail.tcl)
	- If you use the "administrator mail" feature, change its mail alias to
	  point to the new handleAdminMail.pl (instead of handleAdminMail.tcl).



4/30/99 Now uses autoconf, and comes with a configure script.  A few
new variables can be defined in your configdata file, and probably
need to be.  See the file configdata.in for a list of the new parameters.
