This file contains only important changes made to Bonsai.  If you
are updating from an older verseion, make sure that you check this file!

For a more complete list of what has changed, use Bonsai itself, at
(http://cvs-mirror.mozilla.org/webtools/bonsai/cvsqueryform.cgi) to
query the CVS tree.  For example,

will tell you what has been changed in the last week.


11/9/99 I have discovered that Bonsai gets all screwed up if you have multiple
files with the same name but different capitalization in your directory.  This
is because the tables were all defined to have case-independent strings, but
you want them to be case-dependent.  To fix, feed the following to mysql:

	alter table dirs change column dir dir varchar(128) binary not null;
	alter table files change column file file varchar(128) binary not null;
	alter table people change column who who varchar(32) binary not null;
	alter table repositories change column repository repository varchar(64) binary not null;
	alter table branches change column branch branch varchar(64) binary not null;
	alter table checkins change column revision revision varchar(32) binary not null, change column stickytag stickytag varchar(255) binary not null;
	alter table tags change column revision revision varchar(32) binary not null;



10/12/99 Apparently, newer alphas of MySQL won't allow you to have
"when" as a column name.  So, I have had to rename a column in the
checkins table.  You must feed the below to mysql or you won't
work at all.

	alter table checkins change column when ci_when datetime not null;


7/9/99 Ported completely to perl!  (Due to heroic efforts by Dieter
Weber <dieter@Compatible.COM>).  Among the things you need to do to
get this to work are:

	- Realize that this installation will clear the "hook", and will
	  prevent you from seeing any old hooks that were created by the old
	  TCL code.
	- Create a treeconfig.pl, based on the tree data in your old
	  (now obsolete) configdata.
	- Make sure your perl contains the MailDate and libnet CPAN modules
	  (see INSTALL for how to get these)
	- Add a new column to the descs table (Dieter added this to speedup
	  database rebuilds).  Feed this to mysql:

		alter table descs add column hash bigint not null;

	- Go visit the new editparams.cgi page, and adjust everything.
	- Change your mail alias to point to the new handleCheckinMail.pl
	  script (instead of handleCheckinMail.tcl)
	- If you use the "administrator mail" feature, change its mail alias to
	  point to the new handleAdminMail.pl (instead of handleAdminMail.tcl).



4/30/99 Now uses autoconf, and comes with a configure script.  A few
new variables can be defined in your configdata file, and probably
need to be.  See the file configdata.in for a list of the new parameters.
