# are both encoded as a sequence of characters from a set containing
# 64 characters, each one of which represents 6 bits of the salt/hash.
# The encoding is similar to BASE64, the difference being that the
# BASE64 plus sign (+) is replaced with a forward slash (/).

# versions of crypt will just use the first two characters of the salt.
