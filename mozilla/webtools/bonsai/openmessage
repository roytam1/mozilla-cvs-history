<H1>You are responsible to make sure the build works.</H1>

You just checked into <tt>%dir%</tt> the files <tt>%files%</tt>.  At
about <tt>%nextclose%</tt>, the tree will be frozen.  From about
an hour later on, you are to be available for the build team to pester
in case of any problems.

<P>

Any further checkins you make before the tree closes will <i>not</i>
cause you to receive more copies of this mail, but you'll be held
responsible for them too.

<P>

For more info on the current state of the tree, see the 
<a href=http://warp/bonsai/toplevel.cgi>Bonsai main page</a>.

<P>

Your contact info and other vital data is listed below.  Please 
<a href=http://warp/bonsai/profile.cgi?person=%name%>update</a> 
this info <b>immediately</b> if it is at all inaccurate or incorrect.
