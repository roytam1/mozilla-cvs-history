This is Tinderbox.  See <http://www.mozilla.org/tinderbox.html>.


	==========
	DISCLAIMER
	==========

This is not very well packaged code.  It's not packaged at all.  Don't
come here expecting something you plop in a directory, twiddle a few
things, and you're off and using it.  Much work has to be done to get
there.  We'd like to get there, but it wasn't clear when that would be,
and so we decided to let people see it first.

Don't believe for a minute that you can use this stuff without first
understanding most of the code.


	============
	DEPENDENCIES
	============

To use tinderbox, you must first have bonsai up and running.
See <http://www.mozilla.org/bonsai.html>.

Be warned now that bonsai is not easily installed.


	====================================
	What's What in the Tinderbox sources:
	====================================

This is a rough first pass at cataloging and documenting the Tinderbox
sources.  Many hands have been in this code over the years, and it has
accreted wildly.  There is probably quite a lot of dead code in here.
