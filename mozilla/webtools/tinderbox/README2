# Some notes quickly scrawled down, current way to hack
# tinderbox for mozilla.  Note work is already starting
# on tinderbox2, this should be easier to hack on.
# Only read this if you're doing a mozilla tool,
# other people should go look at tinderbox2.

# Get a copy of tinderbox doing something on your
# local machine.
#
cvs checkout mozilla/webtools/tinderbox  # server
cvs checkout mozilla/webtools/bonsai     # tinderbox needs bonsai

ln -s /usr /usr/bonsaitools              # tools use bonsaitools, which
                                         # is . in the linux case.

cd mozilla/webtools/tinderbox            # get some sample data going
./copydata                               # grabs a copy from current
                                         # tinderbox

# Point a webserver at mozilla/webtools/tinderbox
# and you should see a copy of what the trunk
# looks like.

#
# Run a client to get some test build data
#
cvs checkout mozilla/tools/tinderbox   # build client, e.g. harpoon
cd mozilla/tools/tinderbox
./build-seamonkey.pl --example-config  # Spit out sample config file.

#
# Edit tinder-config.pl file to suit local needs
#

# Start build client.  Wrapper for build-seamonkey.pl
# to keep track of PID for killing the process with "stop".
./tinderbox depend start

# Note you can run a single test by hand once you have
# a binary in place:
./build-seamonkey.pl --testonly --once

#
# Hacking from here is up to you.
