How To Install
--------------

Assumptions:
    1) You've got a working database with the appropriate schema
    2) You've got cake setup on your server already.  The code you're looking at now
    is just what is in the /app/ directory - everything else will have to be on your
    server already.

Steps:

1) Copy config/database.php.default to config/database.php and fill in your database
values (if you're only doing production, just fill in the production area).

2) Edit /webroot/index.php.
        Define ROOT:
            If you're installing this in your home directory, ROOT should be:

                DS.'home'.DS.'username'.DS.'public_html'
            
        Define APP_DIR:
            ROOT is the parent directory of the app, this is the actual app.
            Continuing the example above, if people are going to go to:
            http://server.com/~username/survey/ to get to the app, APP_DIR should be:

                survey
        
       Define CAKE_CORE_INCLUDE_PATH:
            This is the path to the actual cake install on your server.  For example:
            
                DS.'usr'.DS.'local'.DS.'lib'.DS.'php'.DS.'cake'

3) Edit /webroot/.htaccess.  Add a RewriteBase line below the line that says 'RewriteEngine On'.  
For our example, we would add the line:

                RewriteBase /~username/survey

4) Edit /.htaccess.  Add the same RewriteBase line from step 3 directly below the 
'RewriteEngine On' line.
