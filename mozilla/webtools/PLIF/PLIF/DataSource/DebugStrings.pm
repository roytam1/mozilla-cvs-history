 !
 !  This example will dump every single string passed into it. For
 !  example, if you pass it a hash with one item 'data' containing two
 !  items 'a' and '(b)' with 'a' containing 'hello' and '(b)'
 !  containing an array of two values 'wonderful' and 'world', you
 !  would get as output the following (note that special characters
 !  '(' and ')' are automatically sanitised by COSES to '[' and ']'):
 !
 !     coses: last condition = 0
 !     coses: white space = 1
 !     data.a = hello
 !     data.[b].1 = wonderful
 !     data.[b].2 = world
 !
 !  This example uses almost all the features of COSES, and so is
 !  quite a useful example to study. (It doesn't use all of the values
 !  of <set>'s attributes nor the escaping attributes of <text>.) It's
 !  also a great help when debugging! You can use it at any point in a
 !  COSES document merely by nesting it, so you can, for example,
 !  study what is happening with a <set> statement. If you declare
 !  this example as having the name 'debug.dumpVars' then to embed it
 !  you would do:
 !
 !     <include href="debug.dumpVars"/>
 !
 !  This example is covered by the same license terms as COSES itself.
