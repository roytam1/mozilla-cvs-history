# NOTES
#
# The codepath resulting from a call through PLIF::Output::Generic are
# somewhat involved, although they make for a very flexible and
# powerful potential result.
#
# In the logic code, you simply have to call the output method without
# worrying about anything:
#
#     $app->output->HelloWorld($fullname, $date);
#
# ...or whatever. However this ends up following the following
# codepath:
#
# First, the PLIF internal program logic (Program.pm) looks for a
# specific output handler for the protocol (we'll assume we're using
# HTTP here). This will typically fail.
#
# Then it looks for a generic output handler (probably this module).
#
# It calls the generic output module's 'HelloWorld' method, which in
# this case doesn't exist and ends up going through core PLIF and then
# back to methodMissing implemented in this module and the ancestor
# Output module.
#
# The methodMissing methods first call every output dispatcher service
# for the actual protocol (HTTP in this case) and then every output
# dispatcher service for the generic protocol until one of them
# handles the HelloWorld method.
#
# This ends up calling HelloWorld on one of the output dispatchers,
# which should result in calling the 'output' method of this object
# (defined below) with a string name and a hash.
#
# The output method now fetches the string and related metadata from
# the string data source which calls the default database which calls
# the configuration data source which calls the configuration file
# database which looks up the name of the database, which is used to
# look up the list of variants and the specific string which should be
# used from those variants. If that fails, then the string data source
# will just return a "nope, sorry, not me" response.
#
# If that happens, then the output method instead asks the default
# string datasources.
#
# The output method then calls for an appropriate string expander
# service, passes it the string and the data hash, and waits for
# another string in return.
#
# The string expander typically passes this string to an XML service
# (which typically calls expat) to get it parsed and then handles it
# as appropriate to get some string output.
#
# The output method then looks for a protocol outputter and passes it
# the final string.
#
# The stack then unwinds all the way back to the application logic.
#
# Phew! Bet you never thought writing "Hello World" would be that
# hard. But at least this means we can do it in HTML and SVG without
# changing the underlying code.

# To find the list of strings required, do this:
#    my %strings = @{$app->getCollectingServiceList('dispatcher.output')->strings};
