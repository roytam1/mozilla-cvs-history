# intended to be added to the application's object list, they are
# created by invoking the 'createObject' method on a service, they
# initialize with 'objectInit' and not 'init', they are queried with
# 'objectProvides' and not 'provides'. On the other hand, service
# instances are services that are NOT intended to be kept in either of
# the controller's lists, they are created by the controller, and they
# are never asked for as normal services.

# dispatches to the current object; this finds a service that supports
# the method and dispatches the call to them.
