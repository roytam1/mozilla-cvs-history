call $self->load(), which loads any unloaded __DATA__ blocks in any of
the module's ISA chain.

CGI input needs POST support


Abstract out the metadata stuff in the Input classes.


Change output system (again) by removing the pointless
dispatch.generic layer. All it does is convert a set of parameters
into a hash labelling those parameters. The callers can do that, it's
just like requiring named arguments.


Make the DBI Results Frame return array refs and not arrays (will
require rather large changes throughout PLIF).


Make getSettings return a boolean instead of raising an exception.
