This is where the Dojo libraries go.
You can get Dojo from http://dojotoolkit.org/

You can either intall one of the releases (such as the 
kitchen-sink or widget release) or you can check it out from Subversion.

$> cd /path/to/bugzilla/testopia
$> svn co http://svn.dojotoolkit.org/dojo/trunk/ dojo/

When you are done installing you should see the src folder and 
the dojo.js file in this directory. Make sure they are readable 
by the we server.
