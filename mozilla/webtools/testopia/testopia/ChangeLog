  * Version 0.7
  
  * Bugzilla's administrators are allowed to manage test plans by default.
  * Table test_cases_log now with its own 'group_id' column (there were potential problems with prev setup).
  * New test log state: running. This lets testers to "reserve" test cases so others will see it as "running" and won't pick it up.
  * Test cases have an order inside a plan.
  * Ability to change the status of several test cases altogether.
  * Added more fields to test_run: product version, platform, OS.
  * Fixed listing of test case logs tied to a test case.
  * Fixed problem on IE remembering selections from the last test case query (tr_query page).
  * Simplified edit of test run notes. Notes added to test run reports.
  * Fixed problem refreshing the list of test case when cloning or deleting test cases.
  * Fixed minor problem: deleting a test run presents now the list of test runs.
  * Fixed problem with null run_mode test cases. run_mode field cannot be null now.
  * Added script & arguments fields to test cases.
  * Incident report now lists every bug, not only bugs tied to failed test case logs. Also shows the bug's component.
  * Now using Bugzilla template hooks. Patching reduced significantly.
  * Fixed several problems regarding unescaped quotes inside fields.
  * Documentation cleaned up of funny English by Michelle Greenlee. Thanks!
  * Fix: import failed if test plan tags already existed. Now it updates tags if they are already there.
  * Ask for a test run manager when starting a new test run.
  * Group added to the search page.
  * Added platform and op_sys as column on the list of test runs.
  * Multiline text displayed goes now inside <pre></pre>.
  * Tested on Opera 8. Doesn't look too bad. HTMLArea won't work though.

2005-06-19  Ed Fuentetaja  <efuentetaja@acm.org>

  * Version 0.6.2
  
  * When a new test run is created, test runner now goes to that test run page (tr_testruns.cgi).
  * Problem with test run fixed. It can be called from two pages (tr_edittestplans & tr_testplan_form) 
    but, if there is an error it doesn't remember where you called it from, it always 
    goes to tr_edittestplans
  * Now testruns.cgi looks like currenttestruns.cgi
  * test plan document converted to templates
  * Send email to testers on a new test run
  * SendEmail method fixed
  * Test Run IEEE reports: Test log report & Test incident report
  * Ability to create test cases "check this is fixed" from the list of reported bugs on a test run.
  * Test-run notifications email content are now configurable params
  * Add links to tr_testruns.cgi header
  * Show the % bar also on tr_testruns.cgi
  * Fix: bugs can be added to test cases without regard of the product they are tied to.
  * Directory data looks protected (.htaccess) on Bugzilla 219* -> this affects charts
  * Administrators now don't have any restrictions on the UI (they still need to belong to BTR's groups)

2005-04-02  Ed Fuentetaja  <efuentetaja@acm.org>

  * Version 0.6.1
  
  * Added a new simplified interface for testers.
  
2005-02-01  Ed Fuentetaja  <efuentetaja@acm.org>

  * Version 0.6
  
  * Added support only for Bugzilla 2.18. This version doesn't support
    previous Bugzillas. For that you need to use version 0.5.2.
  
2005-02-01  Ed Fuentetaja  <efuentetaja@acm.org>

  * Version 0.5.2
  
  * Added German language module for HTMLArea by Brand Lars.
    (Anyway the spell-checker is disabled by default).
  
  * Added updated db models reversed engineered by Pieter-Paul Spiertz.
  
  * Now _every_ page runs on tainted mode. This was a huge tasks because every
    single piece of functionality had to be touched and tested. I hope this
    will make a difference as far as security. Anyway, I'd appreciate any
    help to this regard. If anybody volunteers to run a code inspection chasing
    security-related problems, that'll be great.
  
  * Fixed a _huge_ number of small bugs and nuances. Since I've found so many
    and I don't believe that Test Runner's users are shy, it makes me wonder.
    Maybe there are very few users, or, its users are so amazed by Test Runner
    functionality that they forget these minor problems (kind of the "dancing
    bear" syndrome, from the book "the inmates are running the asylum").
    I believe the first option is truer.

2004-04-21  Ed Fuentetaja  <efuentetaja@acm.org>

  * Fixed numerous warnings from the apache's error log.

  * Replaced text areas by HTMLArea, a WYSIWYG html editor.

  * Added the component column to the list of test cases.

  * 'Update test case logs' now only updates confirmed test cases.
  
  * Added automated regresion test scripts from Sytze.

2004-01-27  Ed Fuentetaja  <efuentetaja@acm.org>

  * compatibility with both Bugzilla 2.16.* and 2.17.*
    
  * install script installs the application and creates or upgrades the BTR's database, as needed
    
  * upgrade script to migrate BTR 0.3 to this version

2004-01-18  Ed Fuentetaja  <efuentetaja@acm.org>

	* test cases can be marked as public, so anybody can run them

	* more than one tester can be assigned to a test case, but it only needs to be run once

	* improvements on the UI and usability of the most common pages

	* cleaned up and removed duplications in the code. A future use of templates is now closer

2003-11-21  Ed Fuentetaja  <efuentetaja@acm.org>

	* patch : updated to work with Bugzilla 2.17.6

	* tr_buglist_to_plan : fixed bug: still using the products field

2003-11-15  Ed Fuentetaja  <efuentetaja@acm.org>

	* doc : updated documentation.

	* (all) : version migrated to make it work with Bugzilla 2.17.4


2002-09-27  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* doc : updated documentation.

	* edittestplans.cgi (InitTestCaseLog): Placed version info in header (version 0.2).

2002-09-06  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* buglist_to_plan_query.cgi: Added a feature to turn buglist into test plan. This way you can use
	Testopia as "supervising tool" for verifing set of bugs.

2002-06-17  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* testrun_testers.cgi : Added a form to reassign test-cases "by bug owner". This is intended
	to work together with test tests created out of lists of bugs (see 2002-06-10 buglist_to_plan.cgi
	note). If a test case has "show_bug.cgi" is summary, it can be reassigned to tester, which is
	bug reporter.

2002-06-12  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* testruns.cgi : Removed hyperlinks to 0-items bug lists. Replaced plain user mail address with
	"mailto" tag in tables.	

	* tr_caselogform.cgi (DoRunNotifications): Case id is put to mail subject, user name to main body.

2002-06-10  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* tr_query.cgi : $jscript must be parameter 5 to PutHeader.

	* tr_testcaseform.cgi : Added a function for copying a test case to another test plan.

	* testruns.cgi : Added hyperlink to "Update test cases" page.

	* testplan_form.cgi : Added hyperlink to "Clone test plan" page. 

	* buglist_to_plan.cgi : Status of new test case is "confirmed". Added handling of %description%
	in test case "action". It is expanded to bug's description.

	* testrun_update.cgi : Added a feature for updating test run. "Updating" means creating
	test case log entries for all test cases, which are in parent test-plan, but have to log
	entries in test run (i.e. were added after test run were created)

	* clone_testplan.cgi : Added a feature for makeing a copy of test plan. Various "copy options"
	available.

	* buglist_to_plan.cgi : Added a feature to create test cases out of bug list. I started to use
	Testopia as "to-do container" for the things related to testing. I often have a situation, when 
	I wanted testers to test if a list of bug is fixed in current release.
	Using this module, you can add "test-cases" out of buglist. For each bug in the list, a test-case
	is created for selected plan.  A test-case is just a note "check bug ###". But this forms a list
	of to-do items, which I can trace. The text of a note is configurable through.
	bug-to-test-case-summary, bug-to-test-case-action and bug-to-test-case-effect parameters. You can 
	use %id% symbol to include hyperlink to bug page.
	

2002-05-23  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* tr_testcaseform.cgi: Improved checking for IE version in javascript.

2002-04-17  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

2002-03-27  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* testrun_notif.cgi: Added interface for notifications setup.

	* btpm_util.pl: Added "constants" for e-mail notification masks.
	Added SendEmail procedure.

	* tr_caselogform.cgi: Added mechanism for email notifications. Notifications are set up separately for 
	each test-run. The testrun manager can receive the notifications when:
	- test-run completes (no 'idle' case log entries left)
	- test-run completes for tester
	- test-run completes for component
	- test case log entry is marked as failed

	* testruns.cgi: Added link to notifications configuration.

2002-03-25  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* btpm_util.pl: Defined global $::users_select_limit - it is used to defined maximum number of users
	displayed in user-selection pop-ups.
	Added some utility functions.

	* doc/ref_param.html: Describe new options.

	* doc/install.html : Described new options (new-case-action-template and new-case-effect-template).
	Described Bugzilla bug-fix for GenerateCode procedure.

	* tr_caselogform.cgi : Test case can now be re-assigned to another tester. Only test-plan editor or
	test run manager can do it.
	Added "Just mark as failed" option when marking the log entry as failed.

	* testruns.cgi: New fields can be set: notes and manager.

	* testrun_testers.cgi : Testers and test cases can now be reassigned when test is running 
	(Finally!!! - I really missed it)

	* testrun_reports.cgi: Added some new charts and bug-fixed the old ones.

	* edittestplans.cgi (RunTest): New field (manager) for test run is set to test-plan editor, when 
	test run is created.

	* caselogform.pl: IsManager function is now used to verify case-access rights;
	"Reassign" button added.

	* testman.sql: Added columns to test_runs table:
	- manager (person managing given test run)
	- notes (notes for test run)
	- notifications (e-mail notifications mask)

2002-03-18  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* edittestplans.cgi (InitTestCaseLog): Missed some SQL-quotes when creating new test plan.

2002-03-11  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* edittesters.cgi (PrintTestersAssignForm): Number of test cases defined is put to table header for each component.
	It makes it easier to balance number of test cases assigned for testers.

2002-03-08  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* btpm_util.pl : Added some utility functions needed by other modules.

	* testrun_reports.cgi : Added bug-statistics reports for test run. You can get the numbers of bugs detected during
	selected test run for each tester. Charts are also available.

	* tr_testcaseform.cgi : After pressing "back" before saving values in test case form once again,
	I added "change-notification" for this form.  A picture is displayed next to "summary", "action" and
	"effect" when fields need save. Must use some Java Script here, but I hope it will work with various
	browsers (checked for IE5, NS4, NS6). Anyway - the feature seems worth some risk for me.

	* tr_edittestcases.cgi : Only privileged user can remove unused versions of test cases.
	(NewTestCaseForm): Template values for case action and effect are used when creating new case.

	* tr_editgroups.cgi : Improved support for group templates. Template can be deleted.

	* testruns.cgi (PrintPlanHeader): The form displays version of test document used for this run, not current version.
	(PrintTestersComponents): '%' was prefixed in wrong way...
	(PrintTestersComponents): Added hyper-link to Reports page.
	(PrintTestersComponents): PrintTestPlan function is used to display test plan document in unified form.

	* testplan_versions.cgi : PrintTestPlan function is used to display test plan document in unified form.

	* testplan_form.cgi : PrintTestPlan function is used to display test plan document in unified form.

2002-03-05  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>

	* tr_query.cgi (StringSearch): Added "Find case id #" function.

	* tr_edittestcases.cgi : Added a function to delete all unreferenced test case versions.

	* testruns.cgi : Bugfix - only one test run was printed (aaarrrghh...) because of SendSql in UserInGroup sub.

	* doc/dbschema.html: Added database schema chart.

2002-03-01  Maciej Maczynski  <macmac@xdsnet.pl>
