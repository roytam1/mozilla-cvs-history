We need the new QA wrapper, because we have to test on so many platforms,
that running the tests and evaluating the results for the nightly builds
took about an average workday.
<p><b><font size=+1>New Features:</font></b>
<ul>
<li>
runs from <b>cron</b> / rsh or <b>interactive</b> if desired</li>

<li>
generates <b>summary</b> (no need to look through 60-90 directories)</li>

<li>
sends <b>email</b> about results</li>

<li>
automatically <b>recognizes common errors</b> and problems and conflicts
and corrects them</li>

<br>(or attempts to correct them :-)
<li>
automatically determines <b>which build </b>to test (waits if build in
progress, exits if no build)</li>

<li>
runs on <b>all required platforms</b> (Windows 98 and before not functional
yet)</li>

<li>
also works on <b>local builds</b> (not fully functional yet)</li>

<li>
Windows version runs on <b>free Cygnus</b> instead of MKS only (it has
been decided by management that both need to be sopported, and the main
focus needs to be on MKS, so cygnus is completely broken at the moment)</li>

<li>
debug mode, normal mode and silent mode</li>

<li>
<b>locking</b> mechanism so it won't run twice</li>

<li>
<b>cleanup</b> after being killed and most errors (no remaining selfservers,
tmpfiles, lock files)</li>
</ul>
The 1st script is started via cron between 5:00 and 8:00 am on different
systems, and starts QA on the nightly build. At 10:00 the next script is
started, and sends a QA summary to the nss developers.
<p>Since all.sh never got to run on the MKS Tool kit on Win 95 and 98 and
is almost unusable on NT and 2000 (I got a long list of problems, so does
Larry, in case anyone is interested) we decided to move to the Cygnus tool
kit, but unfortunately this project was abandoned when it was decided that
MKS functionallity is not allowed to be broken.
<p><b>Cygnus Advantages</b>:
<ul>
<li>
<b>free</b></li>

<li>
better handling of <b>processes</b> (background, processIDs, Signals)</li>

<li>
Unix / Linux <b>compatible</b> sh / bash</li>
</ul>
<b>Disadvantages</b>
<ul>
<li>
MKS functionality needs to be preserved (makes <b>8 Windows platforms</b>
instead of 4 for the QA suites - makes 32 testruns on Windows alone)</li>

<li>
In certain functionality's <b>slow</b></li>
</ul>
The new QA wrapper consistst mainly of 2 scripts, nssqa and qa_stat, both
<br>include a common header (header) and a common environment (set_environment).
<br>Also used is mksymlinks and path_uniq.
<p>The scripts that are used on a daily basis are located in /u/sonmi/bin
and checked into security/nss/tests
<p>Parameters and Options are the same for both scripts.
<p><b><u><font size=+1>Parameters</font></u></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nssversion (supported: 30b, 31, tip, default tip)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; builddate (default - today, format mmdd)
<p><b><u><font size=+1>Options</font></u></b>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -y answer all questions with y - use at your own
risk... ignores warnings
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -s silent (only usefull with -y)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -h, -? -help you guessed right - displays the usage
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -d debug
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -f &lt;filename> - write the (error)output to filename
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -fcron writes resultfile in the same location as
would the -cron
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -m &lt;mailinglist> - send filename to mailinglist
(csl) only useful
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; with -f on nssqa
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -l &lt;mozroot> run on a local build - does not
work at this time
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -cron equivalient to -y -s -d -f $RESULTDIR/$HOST.&lt;scriptname>
<p><b>nssqa and qa_stat are Beta , unfortunately I&nbsp;have a lot of other
work and the progress on these scrripts is slow</b>
<p>Please be aware that some iPlanet specific environments and features
are being used.
<p>-d Debug option might be removed from cron in a few weeks - or maybe
not
<br>-l QA on local build is not fully implemented yet
<p>Please do not use on Windows 95 and 98, ME platforms yet.
<p>use -d if script behaves strange or exits unexpectedly
<p><b><font size=+1>How to use the QA-wrapper</font></b>
<br>To test a build, first run nssqa on the required QA platforms (some
buildplatforms require QA to be run on additional platforms - for example
Solaris 2.6 has to be tested on 2.8 32 and 64bit) If QA has been run on
multiple or all required platforms it makes sense to run qa_stat on the
output of nssqa as well.
<br>Before used on a new system (even if the same platform has been tested
before) please use completely interactive, to see what the variables are
being initialized to, and read the warnings. Same is true if being run
from a different user account than svbld.
<p>In any case, if you are using it, please let me know the results.
<p><b><u><font size=+1>Pseudocode Description of nssqa:</font></u></b>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set the directories to run

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; nssqa:init (local)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; locking: if nssqa is already

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
no-lockfile)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; set HOST and DOMSUF variables
if running interavtively

kill running selfservers (sorry - just don't use the svbld

example: local DIST dir does not exist (continues with next all.sh)
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
outputdirectory does not exist (user can specify other)
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Signals 2, 3, 15 are treated
as severe errors
