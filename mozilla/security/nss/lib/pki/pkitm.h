/*
 * A note on ephemeral certs
 *
 * The key objects defined here can only be created on tokens, and can only
 * exist on tokens.  Therefore, any instance of a key object must have
 * a corresponding cryptoki instance.  OTOH, certificates created in 
 * crypto contexts need not be stored as session objects on the token.
 * There are good performance reasons for not doing so.  The certificate
 * and trust objects have been defined with a cryptoContext field to
 * allow for ephemeral certs, which may have a single instance in a crypto
 * context along with any number (including zero) of cryptoki instances.
 * Since contexts may not share objects, there can be only one context
 * for each object.
