/* General
 *
 * Please refer to the libpkix Programmer's Guide for detailed information
 * about how to use the libpkix library. Certain key warnings and notices from
 * that document are repeated here for emphasis.
 *
 * All identifiers in this file (and all public identifiers defined in
 * libpkix) begin with "PKIX_". Private identifiers only intended for use
 * within the library begin with "pkix_".
 *
 * A function returns NULL upon success, and a PKIX_Error pointer upon failure.
 *
 * Unless otherwise noted, for all accessor (gettor) functions that return a
 * PKIX_PL_Object pointer, callers should assume that this pointer refers to a
 * shared object. Therefore, the caller should treat this shared object as
 * read-only and should not modify this shared object. When done using the
 * shared object, the caller should release the reference to the object by
 * using the PKIX_PL_Object_DecRef function.
 *
 * While a function is executing, if its arguments (or anything referred to by
 * its arguments) are modified, free'd, or destroyed, the function's behavior
 * is undefined.

/*
 * FUNCTION: PKIX_Initialize
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 * No PKIX_* types and functions should be used before this function is called
 * and returns successfully. This function should only be called once. If it
 * is called more than once, the behavior is undefined.
 *
 * This function initializes data structures critical to the operation of
 * libpkix. It also ensures that the API version (major.minor) desired by the
 * caller (the "desiredMajorVersion", "minDesiredMinorVersion", and
 * "maxDesiredMinorVersion") is compatible with the API version supported by
 * the library. As such, the library must support the "desiredMajorVersion"
 * of the API and must support a minor version that falls between
 * "minDesiredMinorVersion" and "maxDesiredMinorVersion", inclusive. If
 * compatibility exists, the function returns NULL and stores the library's
 * actual minor version at "pActualMinorVersion" (which may be greater than
 * "desiredMinorVersion"). If no compatibility exists, the function returns a
 * PKIX_Error pointer. If the caller wishes to specify that the largest
 * minor version available should be used, then maxDesiredMinorVersion should
 * be set to the macro PKIX_MAX_MINOR_VERSION (defined in pkixt.h).
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *  "desiredMajorVersion"
 *      The major version of the libpkix API the application wishes to use.
 *  "minDesiredMinorVersion"
 *      The minimum minor version of the libpkix API the application wishes
 *      to use.
 *  "maxDesiredMinorVersion"
 *      The maximum minor version of the libpkix API the application wishes
 *      to use.
 *  "pActualMinorVersion"
 *      Address where PKIX_UInt32 will be stored. Must be non-NULL.
 *  "plContext"
 *      Platform-specific context pointer.
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 *  Not Thread Safe
 * RETURNS:
 *  Returns NULL if the function succeeds.
 *  Returns an Initialize Error if the function fails in a non-fatal way.
 *  Returns a Fatal Error if the function fails in an unrecoverable way.

 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *  This function deallocates any memory used by libpkix and shuts down any
 *  ongoing operations. This function should only be called once. If it is

 *
 *  No PKIX_* types and functions should be used after this function is called
 *  and returns successfully.

 *  Not Thread Safe

 *  Returns NULL if the function succeeds.
 *  Returns a Fatal Error if the function fails in an unrecoverable way.

 * FUNCTION: PKIX_ValidateChain
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *  This function attempts to validate the CertChain that has been set in the
 *  ValidateParams pointed to by "params" using an RFC 3280-compliant
 *  algorithm. If successful, this function returns NULL and stores the
 *  ValidateResult at "pResult", which holds additional information, such as
 *  the policy tree and the target's public key. If unsuccessful, an Error is
 *  returned.
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *  "params"
 *      Address of ValidateParams used to validate CertChain. Must be non-NULL.
 *  "pResult"
 *      Address where object pointer will be stored. Must be non-NULL.
 *  "plContext"
 *      Platform-specific context pointer.
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 *  Thread Safe (See Thread Safety Definitions in Programmer's Guide)
 * RETURNS:
 *  Returns NULL if the function succeeds.
 *  Returns a Validate Error if the function fails in a non-fatal way.

/*
 * FUNCTION: PKIX_BuildChain
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *  If called with a NULL "state", this function attempts to build and validate
 *  a CertChain according to the BuildParams pointed to by "params", using an
 *  RFC 3280-compliant validation algorithm. If successful, this function
 *  returns NULL and stores the BuildResult at "pResult", which holds the built
 *  CertChain, as well as additional information, such as the policy tree and
 *  the target's public key. If unsuccessful, an Error is returned.
 *
 *  If the chain building is blocked by a CertStore using non-blocking I/O, this
 *  function will store its state at "pState" and NULL at "pResult". On some
 *  platforms, the caller may be able to obtain information from the state that
 *  will allow the caller to determine when the I/O has completed. In any case,
 *  calling the function again with "pState" containing the returned value will
 *  cause the chain building to resume where it left off. 
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *  "params"
 *      Address of BuildParams used to build and validate CertChain.
 *      Must be non-NULL.
 *  "pState"
 *      Address of BuildChain state. Must be NULL on initial call, and the
 *      value previously returned on subsequent calls.
 *  "pResult"
 *      Address where object pointer will be stored. Must be non-NULL.
 *  "plContext"
 *      Platform-specific context pointer.
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 *  Thread Safe (See Thread Safety Definitions in Programmer's Guide)
 * RETURNS:
 *  Returns NULL if the function succeeds.
 *  Returns a Build Error if the function fails in a non-fatal way.
 *  Returns a Fatal Error if the function fails in an unrecoverable way.
