/* General
 *
 * Please refer to the libpkix Programmer's Guide for detailed information
 * about how to use the libpkix library. Certain key warnings and notices from
 * that document are repeated here for emphasis.
 *
 * All identifiers in this file (and all public identifiers defined in
 * libpkix) begin with "PKIX_". Private identifiers only intended for use
 * within the library begin with "pkix_".
 *
 * A function returns NULL upon success, and a PKIX_Error pointer upon failure.
 *
 * Unless otherwise noted, for all accessor (gettor) functions that return a
 * PKIX_PL_Object pointer, callers should assume that this pointer refers to a
 * shared object. Therefore, the caller should treat this shared object as
 * read-only and should not modify this shared object. When done using the
 * shared object, the caller should release the reference to the object by
 * using the PKIX_PL_Object_DecRef function.
 *
 * While a function is executing, if its arguments (or anything referred to by
 * its arguments) are modified, free'd, or destroyed, the function's behavior
 * is undefined.
 *

/* PKIX_CertStore
 *
 * A PKIX_CertStore provides a standard way for the caller to retrieve
 * certificates and CRLs from a particular repository (or "store") of
 * certificates and CRLs, including LDAP directories, flat files, local
 * databases, etc. The CertCallback allows custom certificate retrieval logic
 * to be used while the CRLCallback allows custom CRL retrieval logic to be
 * used. Additionally, a CertStore can be initialized with a certStoreContext,
 * which is where the caller can specify configuration data such as the host
 * name of an LDAP server. Note that this certStoreContext must be an
 * Object (although any object type), allowing it to be reference-counted and
 * allowing it to provide the standard Object functions (Equals, Hashcode,
 * ToString, Compare, Duplicate). Please note that each certStoreConext must
 * provide Equals and Hashcode functions in order for the caching (on Cert and
 * CertChain) to work correctly. When providing those two functions, it is not
 * required to have all the elements in object to be hashed or checked for 
 * equality, but to provide an unique identification of this certStoreContext
 * instance.
 *
 * Once the caller has created the CertStore object, the caller then specifies
 * these CertStore objects in a ProcessingParams object and passes that object
 * to PKIX_ValidateChain or PKIX_BuildChain, which uses the objects to call the
 * user's callback functions as needed during the validation or building
 * process.
 *
 * The order of CertStores stored (as a list) at ProcessingParams is decisive
 * to the priority certificates are retrieved. We recommend a trusted CertStore
 * should always be the first one on the CertStores list so its certificates
 * are evaluated ahead of other certificates selected based on the same
 * selector criteria.
 *
 * The CheckTrustCallback function is used when the CertStore object
 * supports trust status, which means a Cert's trust status can be altered
 * dynamically. When a CertStore object is created, if the
 * CheckTrustCallback is initialized to be non-NULL, this CertStore is
 * defaulted as supporting trust. Then whenever a Cert needs to (re)check its
 * trust status, this callback can be invoked. When a Cert is retrieved by
 * a CertStore supports trust, at its GetCertCallback, the CertStore
 * information should be updated in Cert's data structure so the link between
 * the Cert and CertStore exists.

/*
 * FUNCTION: PKIX_CertStore_CertCallback
 * DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *  This callback function retrieves from the CertStore pointed to by "store"
 *  all the certificates that match the CertSelector pointed to by "selector".
 *  It places these certificates in a List and stores a pointer to the List at
 *  "pCerts". If no certificates are found which match the CertSelector's
 *  criteria, this function stores an empty List at "pCerts".
 *
 *  Note that the List returned by this function is immutable.
 *
 * PARAMETERS:
 *  "store"
 *      Address of CertStore from which Certs are to be retrieved.
 *      Must be non-NULL.
 *  "selector"
 *      Address of CertSelector whose criteria must be satisfied.
 *      Must be non-NULL.
 *  "pCerts"
 *      Address where object pointer will be stored. Must be non-NULL.
 *  "plContext"
 *      Platform-specific context pointer.
 * THREAD SAFETY:
 *  Thread Safe
 *
 *  Multiple threads must be able to safely call this function without
 *  worrying about conflicts, even if they're operating on the same object.
 * RETURNS:
 *  Returns NULL if the function succeeds.
 *  Returns a CertStore Error if the function fails in a non-fatal way.
 *  Returns a Fatal Error if the function fails in an unrecoverable way.
