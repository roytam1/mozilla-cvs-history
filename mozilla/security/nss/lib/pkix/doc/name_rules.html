<h1>
Notes on libpkix name rules</h1>
&nbsp;
<h2>
Types</h2>
Every type mentioned in RFC 2459 is reflected in libpkix.&nbsp; The type
names, defined in <tt>nsspkix.h</tt>, are exactly the names used in the
RFC with the added prefix of ``<tt>NSSPKIX</tt>.''&nbsp; The <tt>PKIX</tt>
part of the name is to distinguish between these specifically defined types
and more general reflections that are used in higher-level trust domains,
crypto contexts, etc.&nbsp; For example, <tt>NSSPKIXCertificate</tt> is
a type with specific properties defined in RFC 2459, while <tt>NSSCertificate</tt>
is a general type, not necessarily based on an X.509 certificate, that
has additional associated information.
<p>Additionally, libpkix defines some "helper"&nbsp;types, usually when
a type definition in the RFC&nbsp;was unusually complex.&nbsp; These types
are prefixed with <tt>NSSPKIX</tt> as above, but the next letter is lowercase.&nbsp;
Examples of these types include <tt>NSSPKIXrevokedCertificates</tt> and
<tt>NSSPKIXpolicyMapping</tt>.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Simple types</h2>
Many types used in or defined by RFC 2459 have more-or-less equivalent
``natural'' types.&nbsp; These include <tt>BOOLEAN</tt>, <tt>INTEGER</tt>,
the string types, and the date types.
<p><tt>BOOLEAN</tt> values are always automatically converted to and from
<tt>PRBool</tt> types.
<p><tt>INTEGER</tt> types are used in two ways: as a ``small integer,''
typically a quantity, and as an identification value (e.g., the serial
number of a certificate).&nbsp; In the former situation, the RFC usually
states that the values may be limited by the application to some value.&nbsp;
We reflect these integers as <tt>PRInt32</tt> values, which is limited
to about two billion.&nbsp; (The reason an unsigned integer wasn't used
is that we use -1 as an error value; while admittedly reserving one half
of the number space merely to indicate an error is perhaps wasteful, reducing
the count limit from four billion to two isn't that unreasonable.)&nbsp;
``Large integer'' uses are reflected as <tt>NSSItem</tt>s.
<p>String types -- even complicated <tt>CHOICE</tt>s of strings -- are
always converted to and from <tt>NSSUTF8</tt> strings.&nbsp; Most of the
string types can handle any UTF-8 string; the few that don't will check
the <tt>NSSUTF8</tt> string for invalid characters and return an error
if any are found.
<p>Date types are always converted to and from <tt>PRTime</tt> values.
<font color="#FF0000">***FGMR*** or whatever.</font><font color="#000000">&nbsp;
The RFC-defined types may contain values that may not be represented as
<tt>PRTime</tt>s; when conversion of such a value is attempted, the error
<tt>NSS_ERROR_VALUE_OUT_OF_RANGE</tt> will be returned.&nbsp; However,
types that contain time values have comparator methods defined, so that
valid comparisons may be made, even if the time is out of the range of
<tt>PRTime</tt>.</font>
<br><font color="#000000"></font>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font color="#000000">Function names</font></h2>
<font color="#000000">All function names are created by catenating the
type name, an underscore, and the name of a method defined on that type.&nbsp;
In some situations, this does create rather long function names; however,
since these are usually assocated with the more obscure types, we felt
that sticking to a common naming system was preferable to inventing new
names.&nbsp; (The Principle of Least Surprise.)</font>
<br><font color="#000000"></font>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font color="#000000">Universal methods</font></h2>
<font color="#000000">Every type has a few standard methods:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_CreateFromBER</font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Create</font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Destroy</font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_GetDEREncoding</font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Equal</font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Duplicate</font></tt></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000">For types for which a BER encoding can be created
which is not the DER&nbsp;encoding, there is a method <tt>&lt;typename>_GetBEREncoding</tt>.</font>
<br><font color="#000000"></font>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font color="#000000">Accessors</font></h2>
<font color="#000000">Simple accessor method names are constructed with
``<tt>Get</tt>'' and ``<tt>Set</tt>'' followed by the field name:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Get&lt;fieldname></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Set&lt;fieldname></font></tt></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000">Optional fields also have ``<tt>Has</tt>'' and ``<tt>Remove</tt>''
methods, constructed in the same way.</font>
<br><font color="#000000"></font>&nbsp;
<h2>
<font color="#000000">Sequences</font></h2>
<font color="#000000">Sequences have the following accessors:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Get&lt;name>Count</font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Get&lt;name>s</font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Set&lt;name>s</font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Get&lt;name></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Set&lt;name></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Append&lt;name></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Insert&lt;name></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Remove&lt;name></font></tt></li>

<li>
<tt><font color="#000000">&lt;typename>_Find&lt;name></font></tt></li>
</ul>
<font color="#000000">Sets (unordered sequences) replace the <tt>Append</tt>
and <tt>Insert</tt> methods with <tt>Add</tt>.&nbsp; The plural Get and
Set methods operate on arrays of the subtype.</font>
