  Cartman data connection/thread architecture:

  Data connections are opened by the control connection in response
  to a Request {SSL,etc.} Data message. There is one thread per data
  connection that handles the data traffic, and there is one queue that
  receives a shutdown message from a control thread.

  If an exception or other termination occurs on either side, the 
  m_status flag is changed to the specific exception code, and sockets 
  are closed on either side (after final thread shutdown).
  (### mwelch This has the effect of setting SO_LINGER on the outgoing 
  data stream, is this an issue?)

 *          exception of SSL connections.

 * - conn: data connection object
 * - read: this is a value-result argument.  It should be set to the data
 *         chunk size.  One should always use LINESIZE unless there is a
 *         compelling reason to do otherwise.  On return, this value will be
 *         filled with the actual size of the data (or 0 if EOF or < 0 if
 *         error).
 * - buffer: data buffer.  The memory should have been allocated before this
 *           function is called.  The buffer size should be at least equal to
 *           the read size (thus the reason for specifying read value upon
 *           input).
 * - returns: PR_SUCCESS if successful, error code otherwise
 *
