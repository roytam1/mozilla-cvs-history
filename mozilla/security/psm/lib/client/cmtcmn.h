 * FUNCTION: CMT_DecodeAndCreateTempCert
 * -------------------------------------
 * INPUTS
 *    control

 *    data
 *        The DER encoded certificate.

 *
 * NOTES
 * This function sends a message to the psm server requesting a raw DER
 * be decoded and creates a temporary certificate and returns the resource ID
 * associated with the newly created certificate resource.
 *
 * Valid values for the type parameter are as follows:
