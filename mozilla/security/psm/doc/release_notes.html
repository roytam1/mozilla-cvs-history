1.2</h2>
Most changes since the Personal Security Manager 1.3 involves minor bug
fixes and optimizations.
<p>Netscape 6 and Mozilla do not supported signed or encrypted email. For
this reason, features related to email certificates are not available in
this release.

<h2>
<a NAME="unpacking"></a>Installing Personal Security Manager</h2>
Personal Security Manager 1.3 comes installed with Netscape 6 PR3. To install
Netscape 1.3 with Mozilla, see <a href="http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/psm/psm-mozilla/index.html">http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/psm/psm-mozilla/index.html</a>.
<p>The instructions that follow describe how the Personal Security Manager
files are installed on each platform.
<h3>
Installing on Windows 95/98/2000/NT</h3>
Personal Security Manager is installed in a directory called <tt>psm</tt>
in the same directory where the Netscape or Mozilla executable resides.
<p><b>Windows NT users:</b> On Windows NT, you must have administrator
privileges to install Personal Security Manager.
<p><b>All Windows users:</b> Personal Security Manager 1.3 works with Mozilla
and Netscape 6, and Personal Security Manager 1.2 works with Mozilla, Netscape
6, and Communicator 4.7x--but not when any of these browsers are running
at the same time. For example, you must exit Netscape 6 PR3 before launching
Communicator with Personal Security Manager 1.2 enabled.
<h3>
Installing on Unix</h3>
Personal Security Manager must be installed locally, either in the default
location (<tt>/opt/netscape/security</tt>) or in some other local location.
However, if you install Personal Security Manager anywhere other than the
default location, Netscape 6 must also be installed locally.
<p>To run Personal Security Manager on Unix, you must be logged in as the
same Unix user you were logged in as when you installed it.
<h3>
Disabling Personal Security Manager</h3>
To <b>disable</b> Personal Security Manager temporarily, remove the directory
<tt>psm</tt>
from the directory where the Netscape or Mozilla executable resides.

<h3>
<a NAME="Start Up Personal Security Manager with"></a>Use Personal Security
Manager with Netscape 6</h3>
Personal Security Manager starts automatically the first time Netscape
6 needs to perform some action involving security, such as handling an
SSL session.
<p>Follow these steps to view your security settings and confirm that&nbsp;
Personal Security Manager is running:
<ol>
<li>
Launch Netscape 6.</li>

<li>
Choose Security &amp; Privacy from the Tasks menu, then choose Security
Manager to view your Personal Security Manager settings.</li>

<li>
Close the Personal Security Manager window.</li>

<li>
Go to the page <a href="psmtest.html">psmtest.html</a> (in the same directory
as these release notes), then choose Page Source from the View menu to
see the JavaScript code that a web programmer can use to detect Personal
Security Manager and its version number.</li>
</ol>
Note that the version number has two parts. The first is the version of
the PSM client library, and the second is the version of the PSM server
library.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
<a NAME="Use SSL with Server Authentication"></a>Test Basic SSL</h3>
Go to any online store, banking service, brokerage account, or other web
site that supports SSL. Verify that the lock in the lower-left corner of
the browser window is closed when you reach the pages for which SSL should
be enabled, for example a page where you are asked to give your credit
card number.
<h3>
<a NAME="Get a Certificate"></a>Get an SSL Client Certificate</h3>
Go to any public or private CA and apply for an SSL client certificate.
<p>To test one-click certificate issuance, dual key-pair certificates,
and other Personal Security Manager features, system administrators should
download, install, and configure Netscape Certificate Management System.
For complete CMS documentation and other information, see <a href="http://docs.iPlanet.com/docs/manuals/cms.html">http://docs.iPlanet.com/docs/manuals/cms.html</a>.
To download the latest version of CMS, see <a href="http://www.iplanet.com/downloads/download/">http://www.iplanet.com/downloads/download/</a>.
<h3>
<a NAME="View Your Personal Certificate"></a>View Your Certificate</h3>
After you have obtained a certificate, follow these steps to view it:
<ol>
<li>
Click the Security icon in the Navigator toolbar.</li>

<li>
Click the Certificates tab.</li>

<li>
Click to select your certificate.</li>

<li>
Click View.</li>
</ol>
You should see information about your new certificate.
<h3>
<a NAME="Using Your Personal Certificate for Client"></a><font size=+1>Test
Client Authentication</font></h3>
Personal Security Manager allows the SSL server and client to negotiate
which certificate to use, and in most cases they can agree on a single
correct certificate for the client to present. When this happens, the user
can access an SSL site that requires client authentication with zero additional
clicks.
<p>To test client authentication with Netscape Enterprise Server, system
administrators should follow these steps:
<ul>
<li>
Install an Enterprise Server and configure it for client authentication
as described in <a href="http://docs.iplanet.com/docs/manuals/cms/41/dep_gide/entsrv.htm">Appendix
D, Using SSL with Enterprise Server 3.x</a>, of <i>Netscape Certificate
Management System Installation and Deployment Guide</i>.</li>

<li>
Test the Enterprise Server installation as described at the end of Appendix
D using Personal Security Manager.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
<a NAME="Validate Certificates Using OSCP"></a>Validate Certificates Using
OSCP</h3>
Personal Security Manager supports the use of the On-Line Certificate Status
Protocol (OSCP) to check the validity of certificates in real time. Information
about this protocol and how configure Personal Security Manager 1.2 and
a forthcoming version of Certificate Management System to support it will
be available from <a href="http://docs.iPlanet.com/docs/manuals/psm.html">http://docs.iPlanet.com/docs/manuals/psm.html</a>.
<p>It's important to note that Personal Security Manager will accept signatures
from responders only under the following conditions:
<ul>
<li>
The response was signed by a delegated responder--that is, the responder's
certificate was signed by the same CA as the certificate&nbsp; you're trying
to verify and has the <tt>extendedKeyUsage</tt> bit set indicating that
the certificate is an OCSP response signer. The certificate should be the
same as a CA certificate with the addition of the <tt>extendedKeyUsage</tt>
bit.</li>

<li>
The user has designated a default responder in the OCSP Settings dialog
box (available from the Advanced tab under Options).</li>
</ul>
Common problems include the following:
<ul>
<li>
Time drift between the client and server machine. Personal Security Manager
expects the time of the response to be within the past 24 hours. If there
is a difference in the clocks between the machine used to sign the response,
so the response looks to Personal Security Manager like it was signed in
the future, Personal Security Manager interprets this as an error. Run
ntp on both machines to fix this problem.</li>

<li>
The response doesn't include the certificates required to complete the
chain needed to verify the signer's certificate. The client frequently
doesn't have all the certificates in the database that are needed to verify
the signer's certificate, in which case Personal Security Manager can't
verify the signer's certificate and OCSP fails. Make sure the entire chain
is included with every response. This is the safest way to avoid this problem.</li>

<li>
If you are using ValiCert, misconfiguration may cause the Validation Authority
not to send the certificate chain (including the CA root certificate and
the OCSP responder's certificate) correctly.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="Known Bugs/Issues for 13 Release"></a>Known Bugs/Issues for Personal
Security Manager 1.3</h2>

<ul>
<li>
FORTEZZA is not guaranteed to work with this release. [# 94220]</li>

<li>
In some unusual circumstances you may encounter problems such as valid
certificates not being verified or Netscape 6 freezing up. If you encounter
a problem that doesn't appear to have a logical explanation, try the following
as a last resort:</li>

<ol>
<li>
Exit Netscape 6, then relaunch it. If necessary, use Control-Alt-Delete
on Windows 95/98/2000/NT to bring up the Task Manager and click End Process
for both <tt>psm.exe</tt> and <tt>netscp6.exe</tt>.</li>

<li>
<b>Warning:</b> <b>Before taking this step, back up your own certificates
stored internally by Personal Security Manager.</b> If exiting and relaunching
Netscape 6 doesn't take care of the problem, in some rare cases it may
work to exit Netscape 6, then delete or rename your <tt>cert7.db</tt> and
<tt>key3.db</tt>
files (located in your user profile directory on Windows 95/98/2000/NT,
or in the directory in which the Netscape or Mozilla executable resides
on Unix) and relaunch the Netscape 6. You should also look for all other
files in the same directory that begin with <tt>cert</tt> or
<tt>key</tt>
and end in <tt>.db</tt> and delete those files as well before relaunching
Netscape 6.</li>
</ol>
