Internet Security Issues</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025374">
Communication over the Internet uses the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). TCP/IP allows information to be sent from one computer to another through a variety of intermediate computers and separate networks before it reaches its destination. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025375">
The great flexibility of TCP/IP has led to its worldwide acceptance as the basic Internet communications protocol. At the same time, the fact that TCP/IP allows information to pass through intermediate computers makes it possible for people to interfere with your communications in the following ways:</P></A>
<ul><P><A NAME="1025376"><LI><B>Eavesdropping.</B> Information remains intact, but its privacy is compromised. For example, someone could learn your credit card number, record a sensitive conversation, or intercept classified information.   </LI></A><P><A NAME="1045160"><LI><B>Tampering.</B> Information in transit is changed or replaced and then sent on to the recipient. For example, someone could alter an order for goods or change a person's resume.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1045185"><LI><B>Misrepresentation.</B> Information passes to someone who poses as the intended recipient. For example, a person can pretend to have the email address <FONT FACE="courier, courier new, monospace">jdoe@mozilla.com</FONT>; a computer can identify itself as a site called <FONT FACE="courier, courier new, monospace">www.mozilla.com</FONT> when it is not; or the web site <FONT FACE="courier, courier new, monospace">www.mozilla.com</FONT> can represent itself as a furniture store when it is really just a site that collects credit card payments and never ships anything.</LI></A></ul><A NAME="1045186">
Normally, users of the many cooperating computers that make up the Internet and other networks don't monitor or interfere with the network traffic that continuously passes through their machines. However, many sensitive personal and business communications over the Internet require precautions that address the threats listed above. Fortunately, a set of well-established techniques and standards known as <a href="glossary.htm#1019178">public-key cryptography</a> makes it relatively easy to take such precautions. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025382">
Public-key cryptography and related techniques make the following precautionary measures possible:</P></A>
<ul><P><A NAME="1025383"><LI><B>Encryption and decryption</B> allow two communicating parties to disguise information they send to each other. The sender encrypts, or scrambles, information before sending it. The receiver decrypts, or unscrambles, the information after receiving it. While in transit, the encrypted information is unintelligible to an intruder.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1025384"><LI><B>Tamper detection</B> allows the recipient of information to detect whether it has been modified in transit.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1025385"><LI><B>Authentication</B> allows the recipient of information to determine the sender's identity.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1025386"><LI><B>Nonrepudiation</B> makes it very difficult for a sender of information to claim at a later date that the information was never sent. </LI></A></ul><A NAME="1044834">
The sections that follow introduce the concepts of public-key cryptography that underlie these capabilities.</P></A>
<A NAME="Encryption and Decryption"></A><A NAME="1044836">&nbsp</A>
<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Encryption and Decryption</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025390">
Encryption is the process of scrambling information so it is unintelligible to anyone but the intended recipient. Decryption is the process of unscrambling encrypted information so that it is intelligible again. A cryptographic algorithm, also called a cipher, is a set of rules or directions used to encrypt or decrypt data. In most cases, two related algorithms are employed, one for encryption and the other for decryption.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025391">
With most modern cryptography, the ability to keep encrypted information secret is based not on the cryptographic algorithm, which is widely known, but on a number called a key that must be used with the algorithm to produce an encrypted result or to decrypt previously encrypted information. Decryption with the correct key is simple. Decryption without the correct key is very difficult, and in some cases impossible for all practical purposes. </P></A>
<A NAME="1032495">
In general, the strength of encryption is related to the difficulty of discovering the key, which in turn depends on both the cipher used and the length of the key. For example, the difficulty of discovering the private key for the RSA cipher typically used for public-key encryption (described in the next section) depends on the difficulty of factoring large numbers, a well-known mathematical problem.</P></A>

<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Public-Key Cryptography</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025394">
Public-key cryptography is a set of well-established techniques and standards that allow a person or other entity to verify its identity electronically and to encrypt and decrypt electronic data. It involves a pair of keys&#151;a public key and a private key&#151;associated with that identity. The most commonly used implementations of public-key cryptography are based on algorithms patented by <a href="http://www.rsa.com/" TARGET="_blank">RSA Data Security</a>. The examples used here describe the RSA approach. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025397">
Each public key is published, and the corresponding private key is kept secret. Data encrypted with your public key can be decrypted only with your private key. <a href="help.htm#1025405">Figure 1</a> shows a simplified view of the way public-key encryption works. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025405">
<P><B>Figure 1&nbsp&nbsp Public-key encryption <p><img src="06pcrypt.gif">
</B></P>
</A><A NAME="1025409">
For example, you can freely distribute your public key, but only your private key can decrypt data encrypted using your public key. To send encrypted data, you encrypt the data with that person's public key, and the person receiving the encrypted data decrypts it with the corresponding private key. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025413">
As it happens, the reverse of the scheme shown in <a href="help.htm#1025405">Figure 1</a> also works: data encrypted with your private key can be decrypted only with your public key. This would not be a desirable way to encrypt sensitive data, however, because it means that anyone with your public key, which is by definition published, could decrypt the data. Nevertheless, private-key encryption is useful, because it means you can use your private key to sign data with your digital signature&#151;an important requirement for electronic commerce and other commercial applications of cryptography. Browser or email software can then use your public key to confirm that the data was signed with your private key and that it hasn't been tampered with since being signed. </P></A>
<A NAME="Digital Signatures"></A><A NAME="1025415">&nbsp</A>
<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Digital Signatures</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025416">
Encryption and decryption address the problem of eavesdropping, one of the three Internet security issues mentioned at the beginning of this section. But encryption and decryption, by themselves, do not address the other two problems mentioned in <a href="help.htm#1025373">Internet Security Issues</a>: tampering and misrepresentation. </P></A>
<A NAME="1032581">
This section describes how public-key cryptography addresses the problem of tampering. The section that follows describes how public-key cryptography addresses the problem of misrepresentation. </P></A>
<A NAME="1032582">
Tamper detection and related authentication techniques involve a special code called a <I>digital signature.</I> A digital signature is derived from both the data to be signed and the private key of the signer, and is unique (for all practical purposes) for each new piece of data that is signed. A digital signature has nothing to do with a handwritten signature, although it can sometimes be used for similar legal purposes.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025421">
Digital signatures make use of a mathematical function called a one-way hash (also called a message digest). A <I>one-way hash function</I> produces a number called a <I>one-way hash</I> that has the following characteristics:</P></A>
<ul><P><A NAME="1025422"><LI>The one-way hash is unique to the hashed data. Any change in the data, even deleting or altering a single character, results in a different value.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1025423"><LI>The content of the hashed data cannot, for all practical purposes, be deduced from the hash value&#151;which is why it is called "one-way."</LI></A></ul><A NAME="1025427">
As mentioned in <a href="help.htm#1025393">Public-Key Cryptography</a>, it's possible to use your private key for encryption and your public key for decryption. Although this is not desirable when you are encrypting sensitive information, it is a crucial part of digitally signing any data. Instead of encrypting the data itself, the signing software (such as Personal Security Manager) creates a one-way hash of the data, then uses your private key to encrypt the hash. The encrypted hash, along with other information, such as the name of the hashing algorithm, is known as a digital signature. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025431">
<a href="help.htm#1025436">Figure 2</a> shows a simplified view of the way a digital signature can be used to validate the integrity of signed data.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025436">
<P><B>Figure 2&nbsp&nbsp Using a digital signature to validate data integrity<p><img src="04digsgn.gif">
</B></P>
</A><A NAME="1025440">
<a href="help.htm#1025436">Figure 2</a> shows two items that are transferred to the recipient of some signed data: the original data and the digital signature. To create the digital signature, the sending software first creates a one-way hash of the original data, then encrypts the hash with the signer's private key.</P></A>
<A NAME="1032547">
To validate the integrity of the data, the receiving software first uses the signer's public key to decrypt the original one-way hash. The receiving software then uses the same hashing algorithm that generated the original hash to generate a new hash of the data that it has received. (Information about the hashing algorithm used is sent with the digital signature, although this isn't shown in the figure.) Finally, the receiving software compares the new hash against the original hash. If the two hashes match, the data has not changed since it was signed. If they don't match, the data may have been tampered with since it was signed, or the signature may have been created with a private key that doesn't correspond to the public key presented by the signer.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025441">
If the two hashes match, the recipient can be certain that the public key used to decrypt the digital signature corresponds to the private key used to create the digital signature. Confirming the identity of the signer, however, also requires some way of confirming that the public key really belongs to a particular person or other entity. Digital IDs called certificates, which are described in the next section, address this issue.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025442">
The significance of a digital signature is comparable to the significance of a handwritten signature. Once you have digitally signed some data, it is difficult to deny doing so later&#151;assuming that the private key has not been compromised or out of the owner's control. This quality of digital signatures provides a high degree of nonrepudiation&#151;that is, digital signatures make it difficult for the signer to deny having signed the data. In some situations, a digital signature may be as legally binding as a handwritten signature.</P></A>
<A NAME="Certificates"></A><A NAME="1025444">&nbsp</A>
<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Certificates</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1025445">
A certificate is an electronic document used to identify an individual, a server, a company, or some other entity and to associate that identity with a public key. Like a driver's license, a credit card, a passport, or other commonly used personal IDs, a certificate provides generally recognized proof of a person's identity. Public-key cryptography uses certificates to address the problem of misrepresentation (see <a href="help.htm#1025373">Internet Security Issues</a>).</P></A>
<A NAME="1025449">
To get a driver's license, you typically apply to a government agency, such as the Department of Motor Vehicles, which verifies your identity, your ability to drive, your address, and other information before issuing the license. To get a credit card, you apply to a company that performs a credit check before issuing the ID. To get a library card, you may need to provide only your name and a utility bill with your address on it.</P></A>
<A NAME="1025450">
Certificates work much the same way as any of these familiar forms of identification. Certificate authorities (CAs) validate identities and issue certificates. They can be either independent third parties or organizations running their own certificate-issuing server software (such as Personal Security Manager). The methods used to validate an identity vary depending on the policies of a given CA&#151;just as the methods to validate other forms of identification vary depending on who is issuing the ID and the purpose for which it will be used. In general, before issuing a certificate, the CA must use published verification procedures to ensure that people or other entities requesting certificates are in fact who they claim to be. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025454">
The certificate issued by a CA binds a particular public key to the name of the person or other entity the certificate identifies (such as the name of an employee). Certificates help prevent the use of fake public keys for impersonation. Only the public key certified by the certificate will work with the corresponding private key possessed by the person or other entity identified by the certificate. </P></A>
<A NAME="1025455">
In addition to a public key, a certificate always includes the name of the person or other entity it identifies, an expiration date, the name of the CA that issued the certificate, a serial number, and other information. Most importantly, a certificate always includes the digital signature of the issuing CA. The CA's digital signature allows the certificate to function as a "letter of introduction" for users who know and trust the CA but don't know the person or other entity identified by the certificate.</P></A>

Certificate Fetching</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1054316">
If you don't have certificates for all recipients of a message that you want to encrypt, Personal Security Manager can automatically fetch their certificates (if available) from a specified directory at the time that you send the message. </P></A>
<A NAME="1054320">
Automatic certificate fetching won't work unless you have specified a directory server to search in. To do so, choose Preferences from the File menu in Communicator, then click Addressing under Mail &amp; Newsgroups. In the right panel, click Directory Server under Pinpoint Addressing, select the directory you want to use from the drop-down menu, and click OK. Personal Security Manager uses this directory to search for any missing certificates when you click the Send button in a composition window for an encrypted message.</P></A>
<A NAME="1054324">
If the directory you want doesn't show up in the Pinpoint Addressing drop-down menu, you can add it to the list using the Communicator Address Book. To do so, choose Address Book from the Communicator menu, then choose New Directory from the File menu. Add information about the directory you want to add in the window that appears. Once the directory has been added to the Address book, you can specify it in your Communicator preferences as described above.</P></A>

To view the Personal Security Manager panel described in this section, you click the Applications tab and then click Java/JavaScript in the left frame. This panel allows you to reset all access privileges for digitally signed Java applets or JavaScript scripts. </P></A>
<A NAME="1053625">
A digital signature associated with a Java applet or JavaScript script allows Personal Security Manager to confirm the signer's identity, determine whether the software has been tampered with, and determine what kinds of actions it is permitted to perform on your computer.</P></A>
<A NAME="1042506">
When a digitally signed applet or script requests special access to your computer, you can grant or deny that form of access to all applets or scripts signed by the same software developer. For example, an applet signed by a game software company might request access privileges that allow it to read and write data to a scorecard file.</P></A>
<A NAME="1054635">
If you reset all privileges in the Java/JavaScript panel, Personal Security Manager erases its record of all such privileges that you have granted or denied and resets access privileges to their default status. If you then attempt to run any applets or scripts that require special privileges, you will again be asked to grant or deny privileges, even if you have previously made this decision.</P></A>

Choose a Personal Security Password</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1051740">
A personal security password protects a <a href="glossary.htm#1028962">security device</a> that contains your certificates and their associated private keys. Personal Security Manager asks for this password, for example, when you sign email messages or use one of your own certificates to identify yourself to a web site.</P></A>
<A NAME="1048318">
A security device may be the one that is maintained internally by Personal Security Manager (called PSM Private Keys security device), or it may be an external hardware device, such as a <a href="glossary.htm#1027625">smart card</a>. Each security device requires a separate personal security password.</P></A>
<A NAME="1047662">
For example, if you are using one or more smart cards to store some of your certificates, you must set a separate personal security password for each one. If you also use the internal PSM security device to store some certificates, you must set a separate personal security password for it as well.</P></A>
<A NAME="1035462">
If someone uses your computer who knows or can guess the personal security password for any security device available to Personal Security Manager, that person can send messages or access web sites while pretending to be you. This can have negative consequences&#151;for example, if you digitally sign important email messages or manage your financial accounts over the Internet. Therefore, it's important to select a password that is difficult to guess. It's also important to record the password in a safe place&#151;and<I> not </I>anywhere that's easily accessible to someone else. If you forget this password, you may not be able to read any encrypted mail stored on your computer. </P></A>
<A NAME="1035146">
Good passwords have the following characteristics:</P></A>
<ul><A NAME="1035148"><LI>Passwords should be 6 to 14 characters long. (Note: If you're using a Macintosh, you cannot create passwords with more than 8 characters.)</LI></A><BR><A NAME="1035178"><LI>Do not use the "illegal" characters: *, ", or spaces. </LI></A><BR><A NAME="1035151"><LI>Do not use words that are in any dictionary, for any language.</LI></A><BR><A NAME="1035190"><LI>Include characters from as many of these categories as possible:</LI></A><BR><ul>

</ul><A NAME="1035266">
The Personal Security Password window allows you to change the password and to set how often Personal Security Manager requires it. Here are some things you should consider when selecting these options</P></A>

This setting causes Personal Security Manager to request your password only the first time it is required after you launch your browser. Personal Security Manager will not request your password again until after you exit your browser and relaunch it. This setting provides the lowest level of protection.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1035296"><LI><B>Every time my security certificate is requested.</B> If you are very concerned about the possibility that somebody else might be able to use your computer to impersonate you, click this radio button. This setting ensures that Personal Security Manager will never access the private key database without first requesting your Personal Security Password. This setting provides the highest level of protection.</LI></A><P><A NAME="1035375"><LI><B>After </B><I>blank</I><B> minutes of inactivity on an encrypted site.</B> If you are somewhat concerned about the possibility that somebody else might be able to use your computer to impersonate you, but not enough to type in your password at frequent intervals, click this radio button and fill in the box with a value you feel comfortable with (for best protection, this should be a fairly low number of minutes, such as 20). This setting is appropriate if you sometimes send or receive confidential information to or from web sites that support encryption. <B>Note that this setting provides little protection against someone using your computer to send a signed email message in your name. </B></LI></A></ul><A NAME="Choose a Portable Security Password"></A><A NAME="1031615">&nbsp</A>
<p><b><FONT Face="arial, helvetica, sans-serif">
 
Choose a Portable Security Password</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1031616">
A portable security password protects one or more certificates that you are backing up using the Backup or Backup All button in the Mine section of the Certificates tab. Personal Security Manager asks you to set a portable security password when you back up certificates, and requests it when you attempt to restore certificates that have previously been backed up. </P></A>
<A NAME="1054758">
<B>Important:</B> When you click the Backup All button, Personal Security Manager attempts to back up all of your certificates that are stored on the default PSM Private Keys security device. Certificates backed up in this manner cannot be restored unless you are using Comunicator 4.71 or later versions, or unless you are using Communicator 4.7 with Personal Security Manager. </P></A>
<A NAME="1054840">
The Backup All button does<I> not</I> back up any certificates that are stored on security devices other than the default PSM Private Keys device. For example, Backup All will not back up any certificates in the list that are stored on a smart card inserted in a smart card reader attached to your computer. Certificates stored on security device s other than PSM Private Keys must each be backed up individually by selecting the name of the certificate and clicking the Backup button.</P></A>
<A NAME="1035482">
If someone obtains the file containing a certificate that you have backed up and successfully restores the certificate, that person can send messages or access web sites while pretending to be you. This can have negative consequences, for example, if you digitally sign important email messages or manage your bank or investment accounts over the Internet. Therefore, it's important to select a Portable Security Password that is difficult to guess. It's also important to record the password in a safe place&#151;and<I> not </I>anywhere that's easily accessible to someone else. If you forget this password, you can't restore the backup of your certificate.</P></A>

Modules</FONT></h2>
<A NAME="1048962">
A Public Key Cryptography Standard (PKCS) #11 module (sometimes called a <I>security module</I>) is a program that works with Personal Security Manager to manage cryptographic services such as encryption and decryption. PKCS #11 modules control security devices that can be implemented in either hardware or software.</P></A>
<A NAME="1048967">
A PKCS #11 module controls one or more security devices (sometimes called <I>tokens</I>) in much the same way that a software driver controls an external device such as a printer or modem. A security device, which can be implemented in software or hardware, provides cryptographic services such as encryption and decryption and optionally stores certificates and keys. Personal Security Manager contains its own internal software security devices. A smart card is one example of an external hardware security device. Each security device is protected by its own <a href="glossary.htm#1024355">personal security password</a>. </P></A>
<A NAME="1040800">
Personal Security Manager provides a built-in PKCS #11 module that controls the internal Personal Security Manager security devices. You may install additional modules on your computer to control smart cards or other external security devices. </P></A>

Many web sites use certificates to identify themselves when you visit the site. If Personal Security Manager doesn't recognize the <a href="glossary.htm#1020903">certificate authority (CA)</a> that issued a web site's certificate, it displays the following windows:</P></A>

Expired Web Site Certificate</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1040329">
Like a credit card, a driver's license, and many other forms of identification, a <a href="glossary.htm#1018895">certificate</a> is valid for a specified period of time. When a certificate expires, the owner of the certificate needs to get a new one.</P></A>
<A NAME="1036463">
Personal Security Manager displays the Expired Web Site Certificate window when you attempt to visit a web site whose certificate has expired. As the window explains, the first thing you should do is make sure the time and date displayed by your computer is correct. If your computer's clock is set to a date that is after the expiration date, Personal Security Manager treats the web site's certificate as expired. </P></A>
<A NAME="1040353">
You can examine information about the certificate, including its validity period, by clicking the View button.</P></A>
<A NAME="1040354">
The decision whether to trust the site anyway depends on what you intend to do at the site and what else you know about it. Most commercial sites will make sure that they replace their certificates before they expire. </P></A>
<A NAME="1040359">
If you believe the certificate's expiration is an inadvertent error, you may want to accept the certificate anyway for this session and let the webmaster for the site know about the problem. </P></A>
<A NAME="1040360">
If you suspect that there may be a more significant problem, either accept the certificate and be cautious about any actions you take while you are visiting the site, or do not accept the certificate (in which case Personal Security Manager will not connect you to the site).</P></A>

Unexpected Certificate Name</FONT></b></p><A NAME="1036466">
A web site <a href="glossary.htm#1018895">certificate</a> specifies the name of the web site in the form of the site's host name. For example, the host name for Netscape Netcenter is <FONT FACE="courier, courier new, monospace">home.netscape.com</FONT>.

Request for Signature</FONT></h2>
<A NAME="1036467">
Personal Security Manager displays the Request for Signature window right before submitting a form that requires your digital signature. The upper portion of the window displays the exact text that needs to be signed. If you have more than one certificate available, the drop-down menu near the bottom of the window allows you to choose which of your certificates Personal Security Manager should use when it creates the digital signature. Choose the one that is most likely to be recognized by the web site that is requesting the signature. For example, if the web site is run by a brokerage firm that has issued you a certificate, choose that certificate.</P></A>
<A NAME="1040672">
When you choose a certificate and click OK, Personal Security Manager sends that certificate along with the digital signature and the signed text. When the server receives the signed data, it uses the public key and other information in the certificate to verify that the signature is valid.</P></A>
