<h1>Requirements</h1>
There are several requirements for versioning schemes:<br>
<ol>
  <li>It should be clear to users, at least which version is more current,
i.e. which version is bigger/higher, given 2 version numbers.</li>
  <li>Whenever we change *anything* and upload it to public ftp servers, the filename must change</li>
  <li>We issue Development and Preview releases.</li>
  <ol>
    <li>Development releases are currently issued when we changed something
bigger and/or likely to fail and want a broader testing. For example, I changed
the build environment on Linux and want to check, if the library dependencies
are OK and work on all distros. Or we added the spellchecker, but it's still
rough and we want to get bug reports.</li>
    <li>Preview releases are sometimes issued as "release candidates", meaning
that we are comfortable with a build and would like to release it, but are
not sure, ifi there are bugs lurking, which other people might find, because
they are testing different things or use a different environment.</li>
    <li>In other cases, Preview releases are issued to give users a build
based on a certain Mozilla milestone. For example, our current, official
stable release is 0.8, which is based on the Mozilla 1.0 branch, and we are
comfortable with it. However, mozilla.org already released Mozilla 1.1final,
which isn't that much better, has new features with a several bugs etc..
Some people might see that Mozilla 1.1 has a new release and want to get
a Beonex Communicator based on it. Other people take it as proof that Beonex
is "behind" Mozilla. For those people, we issue a Beonex Communicator based
on Mozilla 1.1, while the official stable release is still 0.8 (based on
Mozilla 1.0.x).</li>
  </ol>
</ol>
<h1>Current scheme</h1>
The currently used scheme is this:<br>
We have "majorrelease.minorrelease.maintainancerelease-quality-buildnumber",
e.g. 0.8-stable-1, 0.8-stable-2, 0.8.1-stable-1 (in that chronological order).<br>
<h2>majorrelease</h2>
will be changed, if there are really, really, really big changes, something
which doesn't look like the old one anymore. Happens every few years. (We
will at some point of course switch from 0.x to 1.x, which will not be such
a big change. 1.x to 2.x.)<br>
<h2>minorrelease</h2>
is changed, if there are major changes, e.g. when we move to a new Mozilla
release (e.g. 0.6 to 0.9.2.1, 0.9.4.1 to 1.0 or 1.0 to 1.2).<br>
<h2>maintainancerelease</h2>
is changed, if we issue a major bugfixes within one release, not many new
features. Happens, when we merge the latest Mozilla changes within one Mozilla
branch, e.g. Mozilla 1.0 to Mozilla 1.0.1, or when we add new features on
our own, e.g. integrate a spellchecker or roaming.<br>
<h2>quality</h2>
states, if the version has alpha, beta or final status. "dev" are Development
builds (see Requirements), "pre" are Preview builds (see Requirements and
below).<br>
<br>
In reponse to requirement 3.3. (see above), we don't want to call the Mozilla 1.1-based release "0.9-stable", because
that would imply that the current version is 0.9, which is wrong. It would
also make it impossible to call the next "real" stable release 0.9. So, I
called the Mozilla 1.1-based release "0.9-pre-1". A build based on Mozilla
1.2RC1 would then probably called "0.9-pre-2" and the Mozilla 1.2final-based
version would be called "0.9-stable-1"<br>
<h2>buildnumber</h2>
is changed whenever we have to change a release, but we don't think it deserves
to increase the maintainancerelease. Usually, when we issue a build with
a certain security bug fixed or when we fix something were we foobared (e.g.
I notice after the release that the library dependencies on Linux are screwed
and Redhat users can't use the build without a lot of hassle, so I fix it,
rebuild and increase the build number).<br>
<br>
For Preview builds, however, the buildnumber can have the meaning of a minorrelease
or maintainancerelease, see the example under "quality".<br>
<h1>Problems</h1>
The current versioning scheme is very confusing for many people and even took me some time to get used to it <i>myself</i>, although I invented it. This probably means that it's broken. The major problems:<br>
<h2>minorreleases</h2>
We use minor releases when commercial vendors often use major releases. To
some people, this gives the impression of inferiourity, especially the fact
that we're still at 0.x. More on that in the FAQ.<br>
<h2>buildnumbers</h2>
The difference between minorreleases and buildnumbers is not clear to many people<br>
<h2>quality</h2>
Many people miss that as well. Not only consider they the 0.x releases as
"beta" and 'not suitable for general use', depsite the "stable" in the version
name. But some appearantly completely miss the difference between "pre" builds
and "stable" builds, thinking that "0.9-pre" is <i>the</i> (final) 0.9, which is it not.
<h1>Suggestions</h1>
We could move the buildnumber (then starting at 0) after the minornumber,
i.e. "majorrelease.minorrelease.maintainancerelease.buildnumber-quality",
e.g.<br>
<ul>
  <li>0.8-stable-1 becomes 0.8.0.0-stable</li>
  <li>0.8-stable-2 becomes 0.8.0.1</li>
  <li>0.8.1-stable-1 becomes 0.8.1.0 etc..</li>
</ul>
Tha does not solve the problem with preview releases, though. In fact, it makes it worse: How do we call them, then?<br>
<br>
Other suggestions are welcome.<br>
<h1>FAQ</h1>
<h2>0.x</h2>
Why are you still at 0.x, while Mozilla is at 1.x? That implies that your
builds are less unstable.<br>
<br>
A bit history: When Beonex started, Mozilla was
at 0.6 and Netscape at 6.0, which was very unstable and buggy and IMO alpha-(at
beast beta-)quality. IMO, the 0.9.2.1 and later the 0.9.4.1 versions, on
which Netscape based some releases, started being usable. But I had no Windows
builds at that time, so I could not move to 1.0. When Mozilla moved over
to 1.0, I had no time for the PR that such a switch requires.<br>
<br>
I think that
the switch to 1.0 is a unique opportunity for public relations (press coverage
etc.). It signifies something brand-"new" and new things are always good
for press articles. But right now, I don't have the time to do all that PR
work. OTOH, if we don't manage to generate considerable press coverage with
the 1.0 release, we did not just miss a good opportunity, but we risk that
press reporters think at release 1.0.1 or 1.1 "Why didn't I hear about that
earlier, when 1.0 came out? Must be something unimportant, if not even 1.0
was worth to report about. -&gt; Trash".<br>
<br>

Also, I'd like to have some fun release stuff, like a virtual release party
and other goodies (ideas welcome!), which I don't have time for either atm.<br>
<br>

That's why I am so scared about 1.0 and why I push it out atm. Of course,
it all looks different with more helping hands, so feel free to step up!
