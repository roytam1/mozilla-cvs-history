/*
  mwelch 97 July:

  Before adding anything new to MSG_Prefs, consider whether your
  new preference can best be managed using the prefs API directly.
  If you are not getting the preference value often or otherwise
  have no need to cache the prefs value, you are probably better
  off calling the prefs API everywhere and leaving this object 
  alone.

  Having said that, if you want to add a new member variable and
  its access functions to MSG_Prefs, here is the way you want to
  do this, in order to keep the world happy. (Specific conditions,
  of course, may apply to your preference; the instructions below
  apply to most circumstances.)

  If a change in your preference does not need to trigger an immediate
  action:

  1. Put a call to PREF_Get{Int,Bool,Char,etc.)Pref in the Reload()
     method for your member variable and its corresponding JavaScript
	 preference name. This should be the only way by which your 
	 member variable is set.

  2. Your Get() accessor function must call Reload() before returning 
     the member value. This is the way by which you can be assured that
	 the most recently set preference value

  3. If you must have a Set() accessor, implement it in such a way
     that it calls PREF_Set{Int,Bool,Char,etc.}Pref, instead of
	 setting your member variable directly. This way, the prefs API 
	 (and the user's preferences.js file) is properly updated. The 
	 new value circulates back using Reload() and Get() as 
	 described above.

  If a change in your preference requires an immediate response (alert,
  change in behavior, etc):

  1. Implement the preference as described above.

  2. In MSG_PrefsChangeCallback, there is a top-level parse tree (looking
     for names beginning with "mail", "news", or "netw"). Find the clause
	 corresponding to your preference name and add a condition with code
	 that needs to run when your preference changes. Even if the code that
	 runs within MSG_PrefsChangeCallback always reloads on its own, you 
	 still want to leave a load call within Reload() in order to load 
	 the initial value at startup time.

  If you have a transaction that spans across several preference changes,
  be sure to tell the right people so that we can someday have calls to
  transactionalize preference changes. Currently, all we can do is respond
  to changes to individual preferences.

	// This preference is used to help decide when to perform one time tricks, based
	// on the age of the current user profile.  

	// The theory is:  On a fresh install (actually, the creation of a new user profile),
	// we should never do any one-time upgrade tricks.
	// On an install over a previous verison, we should run each of the upgrade tricks that
	// haven't already been run, for each old profile.

	// The first such example is dealing with the introduction of the imap delete messages
	// model in 4.02.  We wanted the imap delete model to be the default out of the box but 
	// we also wanted a painless upgrade for existing users who use the delete to trash model.
	// The solution is to make the imap delete model the default but if you haven't run the
	// IMAP delete model upgrade and you have a trash folder, then change the preference to the
	// trash model.  In either case, the profile age is now changed to reflect that we have made
	// this upgrade, by setting the appropriate bit. 

	// We will do this in a bitwise manner, so that individual one-time tricks do not depend
	// on the order in which we check for them.

	// This preference should ALWAYS be written to the prefs.js file, unless the value is 0.
	// A value of 0 indicates an upgrade from Communicator 4.0, in which no upgrades have ever
	// been run.

	// The value written out to the prefs should be the sum of all trick flags which have been run.
	// On a fresh install, we automatically write out the following number:
	// {sum of all flags used for an upgrade trick}
	// We do this in config.js, in modules\libpref\src\init

	// The default value (in all.js) should ALWAYS be 0.  This is because if the preference isn't
	// present in the prefs.js file, then it means the value is implicitly 0 (because we are
	// upgrading from 4.0, and none of the one-time tricks have been run).

	// So, when a new flag is added here, you should also modify "mailnews.profile_age" in config.js
	// to be the following number:
	// {sum of all flags used for an upgrade trick}

	// The Flags
	// see above for #definitions
	// 0x00000001 (reserved for the imap delete model trick)
	// 0x00000004 (reserved for migrating to IMAP subscription)
	// 0x00000008 MSG_IMAP_DEFAULT_HOST_UPGRADE_FLAG (upgraded default host to new per host prefs)
	//
	//
	// *(The special reserved upgrade flag is purposely not used for an upgrade anywhere, except in calculating
	//   the default value for all.js.  This is because we always want the value of "mailnews.profile_age"
	//   written out to the prefs file -- it can NEVER take on the "default" value, or else it will be
	//   removed from prefs.js, and this will defeat the purpose of writing out the "current" profile age.
	//   If we were to ever upgrade, it would find the preference not written out, and assume that it is
	//   up-to-date.
	//   To ensure that it is always written out to the file, in the creation of the MSG_Master we will 
	//   un-set this flag each time, so that on a fresh install, the preference will get written out.
