/* The MimeMultipartSigned class implements the multipart/signed MIME
   container, which provides a general method of associating a bigfun
   signature to an arbitrary MIME object.

   The MimeMultipartSigned class provides the following methods:

   void *bigfun_init (MimeObject *multipart_object)

     This is called with the object, the object->headers of which should be
	 used to initialize the decryption engine.  NULL indicates failure;
	 otherwise, an opaque closure object should be returned.

   int bigfun_data_hash (char *data, int32 data_size, 
						 void *bigfun_closure)

     This is called with the raw data, for which a signature has been computed.
	 The bigfun module should examine this, and compute a signature for it.

   int bigfun_data_eof (void *bigfun_closure, XP_Bool abort_p)

     This is called when no more data remains.  If `abort_p' is true, then the
	 bigfun module may choose to discard any data rather than processing it,
	 as we're terminating abnormally.

   int bigfun_signature_init (void *bigfun_closure,
                              MimeObject *multipart_object,
							  MimeHeaders *signature_hdrs)

     This is called after bigfun_data_eof() and just before the first call to
	 bigfun_signature_hash().  The bigfun module may wish to do some
	 initialization here, or may wish to examine the actual headers of the
	 signature object itself.

   int bigfun_signature_hash (char *data, int32 data_size,
							  void *bigfun_closure)

     This is called with the raw data of the detached signature block.  It will
	 be called after bigfun_data_eof() has been called to signify the end of
	 the data which is signed.  This data is the data of the signature itself.

   int bigfun_signature_eof (void *bigfun_closure, XP_Bool abort_p)

     This is called when no more signature data remains.  If `abort_p' is true,
	 then the bigfun module may choose to discard any data rather than
	 processing it, as we're terminating abnormally.

   char * bigfun_generate_html (void *bigfun_closure)

     This is called after `bigfun_signature_eof' but before `bigfun_free'.
	 The bigfun module should return a newly-allocated string of HTML code
	 which explains the status of the decryption to the user (whether the
	 signature checks out, etc.)

   void bigfun_free (void *bigfun_closure)

     This will be called when we're all done, after `bigfun_signature_eof' and
	 `bigfun_emit_html'.  It is intended to free any data represented by the
	 bigfun_closure.
