lib/libmime  --- a general-purpose MIME parser.

This module, libmime, implements a general-purpose MIME parser.
One of the methods provided by this parser is the ability to emit
an HTML representation of it.

All Mozilla-specific code is (and should remain) isolated in the
file mimemoz.c.  Generally, if the code involves images, netlib
streams, or MWContexts, it should be in mimemoz.c instead of in
the main body of the MIME parser.
