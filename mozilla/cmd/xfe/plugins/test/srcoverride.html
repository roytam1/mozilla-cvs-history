<TITLE>Plugins Test: TYPE attribute overriding SRC attribute</TITLE>
<!-- Changed by: Suresh Duddi, 28-May-1996 -->
<H1>Plugins Test: TYPE attribute overriding SRC attribute</H1>
Plugins Test : <B>TYPE</B> attribute for the EMBED tag overriding
<B>SRC</B> attribute.
<HR>
Embed is here: 
<EMBED src=text.txt type=nowhere/found width=200 height=100>
<br>
<pre>
&lt;EMBED src=text.txt type=nowhere/found width=200 height=100&gt;
</pre>

<! Result !>
<dl>
<dt><FONT Color=red>Result</FONT>
<dd>The type of the embed should be <B>nowhere/found</B> eventhough
the source was text.txt (usually text/plain is its mimetype).
<br>
You should see the nullplugin for this embed.
<p>
Clicking on the embed will show a dialog which will display the mimetype.
Ensure that it says <B>nowhere/found</B>
