<H1>Plugins tests : no SRC and TYPE attributes</H1>
Test : no <B>SRC</B> and <B>TYPE</B> attribute for the EMBED tag.
<HR>
Embed is here: 
<EMBED width=200 height=100>
<br>
<pre>
&lt;EMBED width=400 height=300&gt;
</pre>
<! Result !>
<dl>
<dt><FONT Color=red>Result</FONT>
<dd>There is no <B>SRC</B> and <B>type</B> attribute for the embed tag.
This shouldn't be a problem. You should NOT see any plugin.
