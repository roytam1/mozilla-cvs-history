This is a very simple plugin based on the example for in the UNIX SDK.
All it does is create a file named Worked.nscp in the current directory 
from which netscape was launched.  The purpose of this plugin is to 
do a simple verify that the browser was loaded, nothing else at this time.

To use this plugin in your build scripts, simply invoke netscape with the
page Test.html (which has the embed tag for this plugin in it.
Wait a bit and check to see if the file Worked.nscp was created, if so
issue a kill to the netscape process and go on your way.  If not..
then the browser failed to load and issue an error.

note: be sure to copy the plugin ImAlive.so to your plugins dierectroy.

The make file here is for Solaris 2.4 and is baed on the basic makefiles
that come with the UNIX Plugin SDK.
