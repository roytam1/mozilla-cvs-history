# Sample text plugin makefile
#
# Platform: HP-UX A.09.03
#
# The output of the make process will be libtextplugin.sl
# Install this file either in
#	/usr/lib/netscape/plugins/
#	(or)
#	~/.netscape/plugins/
#	(or) in any convenient directory and point environment variable
#	     NPX_PLUGIN_PATH to point to the directory. It is advisable
#	     that the plugins (.so) are the only files in that directory.
#
# This makefile contains some of our defines for the compiler:
#
# XP_UNIX	This needs to get defined for npapi.h on unix platforms.
# PLUGIN_TRACE	Enable this define to get debug prints whenever the plugin
#		api gets control.
# TEXT_PLUGIN	This will enable parts of the plugin that will use the
#		Motif to display a text area in the plugin window. This
#		is on by default.
