This should build out of the box with the mozilla cvs source code.
It's not close to being functional, but it does build.

Here's what I do to build this:

In the mozilla top level directory run "autoconf".  This will create
the configure script.  You can then create a directory, inside or out
that will contain the build object files and final binaries.  cd into
that directory and run "configure" with the flag "--enable-fe=gnome".
This should create all of the directories and Makefiles.  From there
you should be able to type "make" and take a nap for an hour or so.

Here is an example:

bash$ cvs -z3 co mozilla
[ checkout deleted ]
bash$ cd mozilla
bash$ autoconf
bash$ cd ..
bash$ ../mozilla/configure --enable-fe=gnome
[ configure deleted ]
bash$ make

That should be it.  Anything else is an error.  Happy hacking!
