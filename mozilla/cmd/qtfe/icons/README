To add an icon to the build, add the file into the images directory.
The file will automatically be picked up into the build.
---

The images directory is only for icons that are actually built into the
client as icons.  That means:

  o  No random GIF files that will not become icons
  o  No unused icons unless they will eventually be incorporated into
     the client.

If you don't follow these rules, the client will end up reserving too
many colors for icons.


  File suffix  What it all really means
  -----------  ------------------------
  Foo.gif      Normal
  Foo.i.gif    Insensitive (disabled)
  Foo.mo.gif   Mouse-over  (highlighted)
  Foo.md.gif   Mouse-down  (pushed)
  FooO.gif     Open (no 'O' means closed)
  _MAC.Foo.gif Conditionally compiled (see comment in mkicons.c/icondata.c)

  Transparency:
    Transparency color is magenta [255, 0, 255]
    The gif file itself knows how to designate a color
    as transparent; use giftrans to set this color:

      giftrans -t #ff00ff -o newGif.gif oldGif.gif

    giftrans is PD software:
      /usr/local-irix/bin/giftrans
      /u/mcafee/utilities/SunOS5.4/bin/giftrans
      /u/mcafee/utilities/src/giftrans.c
      [or go get it with Archie]
