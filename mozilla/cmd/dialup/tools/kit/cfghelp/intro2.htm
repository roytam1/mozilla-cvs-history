<P CLASS="title"><B>Account Setup Introduction</B></P>

<P>This screen, with the other Introduction screens, provides an overview of a dial-up connection and how Account Setup is used. Users can view the Introduction after clicking the Start Account Setup button in the first screen of Account Setup.</P>

<P>The first Introduction screen gives users the option of viewing the rest of the Introduction screens or bypassing them and proceeding directly to Account Setup. In either case, users end up at the &quot;Welcome to Account Setup&quot; screen of Account Setup.</P>

<P>You can edit the text and graphics on the Introduction screens to meet your needs. Or, if you don't want to offer the Introduction to users, you can set Account Setup's global options so that it doesn't display any of the Introduction screens. Instead, users go directly to Account Setup. Click [More Help], below, for instructions. </P>
