<P CLASS="title"><B>.cfg File Tab</B></P>

<P>This tab lets you supply a specific local configuration file (<TT>.cfg</TT> file) for an NCI configuration. A local configuration file, which you create using the Configuration Editor tool included with Mission Control, lets you set and lock Communicator preferences, interface options, and security policy options, and so on.</P>

<P>To associate a local configuration file with this NCI configuration, follow these steps:</P>

		<OL>
		<LI>Create one or more local configuration files using the Configuration Editor tool.</LI>
		<spacer type=vertical size=3>
		<LI>Copy the local configuration files into the Config folder, located inside the dialup package that you are now customizing with the Account Setup Editor.</LI>
		<spacer type=vertical size=3>
		<LI>In the .cfg File tab, use the pop-up menu to select which local configuration file you want to associate with the NCI configuration you are working on. The pop-up menu lists local configuration (<TT>.cfg</TT>) files that are present in the Config folder. Note that you don't need to name these configuration files <TT>netscape.cfg</TT>. Account Setup renames the file appropriately when configuring the user's system. </LI>
		</OL>

<P CLASS="nomargins">When a user completes Account Setup, the program moves the selected local configuration file into the proper location in the current user profile folder. Communicator reads reads preferences and settings from this file the next time the user launches it in that profile.</P>
