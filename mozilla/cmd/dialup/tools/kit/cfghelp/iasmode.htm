<P CLASS="title"><B>Use Internet Account Server (IAS) Mode Only</B></P>

<P>In IAS mode, Account Setup presents screens that can ask users for name, address, and credit card number, as well as modem, and dialing information. Account Setup uses the information to connect users to your Internet account server to create accounts.</P>

<P>If you choose this option, Account Setup automatically hides the &quot;Welcome to Account Setup&quot; screen, which lets users choose the mode they want to use. Instead, it takes them directly into the first screen of the IAS mode, &quot;Preparing to Create an Account&quot;.</P>

<P>If you are offering the IAS mode to users, you must provide information about your Internet account server, such as its access phone number and login. To do this, create one or more IAS configurations when you reach the &quot;Connect to Server&quot; screen of the IAS mode.</P>
