<P>This screen appears after the user has connected to your Internet account server and successfully created an account, if the user must restart the computer before connecting to the Internet. Account Setup receives the user's new account information from your server, disconnects from the server, and displays this screen.</P>

<P>This screen lets users choose to have Account Setup write their account information to a text file, for future reference. If you want, you can set Account Setup to writes the account information without the user's account password. Alternatively, you can remove this option from Account Setup. </P>
