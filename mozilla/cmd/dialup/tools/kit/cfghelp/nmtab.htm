<P CLASS="title"><B>Config Name Tab</B></P>

<P>This tab asks you to provide a name for this NCI configuration--the name by which the configuration is listed in the &quot;Your Account Access Location&quot; screen.</P>

<P>If you want to list an access phone number or location rather than a name, make sure to include that information in the configuration name. Account Setup lists each configuration using the exact text you specify in the Configuration Name field.</P>

<P>The tab also lets you provide a technical support phone number for your customers. Account Setup automatically displays this number on the &quot;Preparing to Set Up Access&quot; screen.</P>

<P><B>Note: On Windows 3.1 and WFW 3.11 platforms, using parentheses or other special characters can cause problems. Special characters can interfere with Account Setup when it is creating the associated account icon on the user's desktop. If you have users on Windows 3.1 and WFW 3.11 systems, use a configuration name that contains no special characters.</P>
