<P CLASS="title"><B>About NCI Configurations</B></P>

<P>The NCI mode of Account Setup consists of a series of screens that ask users for their account access phone number, their login, their mail, news, and DNS server information, and so on. You can supply some or all of this information for your users by creating one or more NCI configurations.</P>

<P>When you supply information in an NCI file, Account Setup displays that information as default settings in the Account Setup screens. If you want, you can turn off screens for which you have provided information, so that using the NCI mode becomes simpler and faster for users.</P>

<P>You can preset Account Setup to use a specific NCI configuration, or you can create several configurations and let users choose the configuration they want to use. Alternatively, you don't need to create any NCI configurations at all. Account Setup simply asks users to provide all of the required information.</P>

<P>To create and edit NCI configurations and set options, move to the &quot;Your Account Access Location&quot; screen and click <B>Screen Options</B> in the Toolbar.</P>
