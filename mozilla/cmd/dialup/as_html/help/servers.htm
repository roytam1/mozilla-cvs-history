<P><B>Your Provider's Server Addresses</B></P>

<P>Enter the addresses of your provider's mail and news servers on this screen. Also use the POP/IMAP radio buttons to choose the type of incoming mail server you want to use. </P>

<P>You can find your provider's mail and news server addresses in the forms given to you by your provider when you started your account. If you don't have the information you need, call your provider's technical support office. If you aren't sure if you can use IMAP, select POP for now and contact your provider for more information.</P>

<P>If you want to supply your provider's mail server information later, you can leave the text boxes on this screen blank. However, you won't be able to send or receive email, or read or post to newsgroups, until you do so. When you're ready, you can enter the information in Communicator's Mail & Groups preferences.</P>

<P>Here's what the servers do:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Your provider's SMTP and POP servers send out and bring in your email. Your provider
	might use only one mail server for both functions, so the address might be the same
	for both SMTP and POP.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Your provider's NNTP server delivers newsgroup information to your account.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Your provider's IMAP mail server handles your email using the IMAP protocol, which enables you to store and organize your mail on the server.

</UL>
