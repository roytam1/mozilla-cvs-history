<P><B>Phone Number of Your Location</B></P>

<P>Enter the phone number of the line that is currently connected to your modem or computer. Account Setup uses this information to determine whether to dial an area code or other prefix. Therefore, don't enter your home phone number if you are connecting from another location. Instead, enter the phone number of the phone line that your modem is currently connected to.</P>

<p>If you live in a location where multiple area codes serve your surrounding area, you can enter up to three neighhboring area codes. When you choose an Internet Service Provider, Account Setup uses the alternate area codes to provide you with the best available alternate dial-up access phone numbers closest to your calling location.</p>
