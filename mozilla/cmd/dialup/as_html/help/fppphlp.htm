<A NAME="getting_started"></A> 

<HR SIZE="4" NOSHADE>

<P><B>Getting Started</P></B>

<P>To get started using FreePPP connection software and Netscape Communicator for the first time, follow
these steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Install the Internet Setup software suite from the Netscape Communicator CD, if you
	haven't done so already. If you did an Easy Install of Netscape Communicator, the suite
	is already installed.</LI>
	<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	<LI>Make sure that you have a modem and that it is connected properly to your computer
	and to a phone line. Make sure the modem is turned on.</LI>
	<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	<LI>Run the Account Setup program, if you haven't done so already. Account Setup
	helps you quickly configure FreePPP to access your Internet account. To run Account
	Setup, double-click its icon in the Netscape Communicator folder. If you were already using
	another version of FreePPP before you installed Communicator, your new version of
	FreePPP imports all of your preferences and dialing settings.</LI>
	<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	<LI>When you have successfully completed Account Setup, launch Communicator. FreePPP
	is set to automatically connect to your account. When connecting, you can hear FreePPP
	dialing your modem with the number of your provider. FreePPP also displays the Connection
	Status window to inform you of the progress of the connection.</LI>
</OL>

<P>If Netscape Communicator doesn't automatically launch FreePPP, or if you are having
trouble connecting, turn to the <A HREF="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</A> section.</P>

<A NAME="your_connection"></A> 

<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>Your Internet Connection</B></P>

<P>With Netscape Communicator, you will be connecting to the Internet using a phone line and
modem--a very convenient, practical, and economical way to get what the Internet
has to offer. </P>

<P>
The essential parts of your connection to the Internet are:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI><B>Your personal computer</B>. Your personal computer is where the Netscape Communicator
	and your connection software--FreePPP--are running. FreePPP stores information about
	what number you dial to connect to the Internet, as well as information about your
	modem. When you connect to the Internet, your computer uses FreePPP and your modem
	to dial the phone number of your Internet service provider's computer. FreePPP handles
	the connection and lets you end the connection when you are ready.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI><B>Your modem. </B>Your modem is a critical part of your Internet connection.
	Without it, you could not connect. A modem translates computer data into a stream
	of sounds that travel along the phone line to your Internet service provider. Your
	Internet service provider has another modem at its end of the phone line that translates
	the stream of sounds back into computer data.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI><B>A telephone line.</B> To use the Internet, your personal computer needs a
	way to exchange data with your Internet service provider's computer. In a dial-up
	connection, this is accomplished using a phone line. Any ordinary phone line will
	do: you can use your home phone line, a hotel phone line, or even, in some places,
	a pay phone line.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI><B>Your Internet service provider.</B> Your Internet service provider is your
	gateway to the Internet. Your provider's computer answers the phone call from your
	personal computer. When it answers the call, the two computers can &quot;talk&quot;
	to one another over the phone line. Your Internet service provider's computer takes
	care of passing information back and forth between your computer and the Internet.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI><B>The Internet. </B>The Internet is a global network of computers that cooperate
	to exchange information. Many of the computers on the Internet, such as your Internet
	service provider's computer, are permanently connected together with fiber-optic
	lines that can carry data at very high rates of speed. Using the Internet, you can
	exchange information with any other user or computer linked to the network.</LI>
</UL>

<P><A HREF="#contents"><FONT SIZE="2">[CONTENTS]</FONT></A></P>



<A NAME="fp_as"></A> 


<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>FreePPP and Account Setup</B></P>

<P>FreePPP features an easy-to-use, graphical interface that lets you configure it to
meet your needs. However, your version of Netscape Communicator includes Account Setup, a program that
handles configuring FreePPP for you, based on information you provide to it. Although
you can configure FreePPP manually, you do not need to do so.</P>

<P>If you want to configure FreePPP manually, instructions are provided in this Help
document. If you want to use Account Setup to configure FreePPP, simply launch Account
Setup by double-clicking its icon in the Netscape Communicator.</P>

<P><A HREF="#contents"><FONT SIZE="2">[CONTENTS]</FONT></A></P>



<A NAME="profiles"></A> 
<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>FreePPP and Multiple User Profiles</B></P>

<P>Netscape Communicator includes a feature called multiple user profiles that lets
several users share a single copy of Communicator. Each user can create his or her
own &quot;profile&quot;, which is a complete set of Communicator preferences, an
email identity, a set of bookmarks, a set of mail and news server addresses, and a set
of email mailboxes and messages. A profile also includes a user's subscribed newsgroups and address book. By creating multiple profiles, each user can keep
his or her preferences, bookmarks, and email separate from those of other users.</P>

<P>Netscape Communicator lets you associate dialing information in FreePPP with specific
profiles, and in FreePPP you can store information about any number of Internet accounts
and modems. This gives you many ways to use profiles to make accessing the Internet
more convenient.</P>

<P>For example, you could create more than one profile for yourself, setting up one
profile for accessing your Internet account from work and another for accessing it
from home. Or, if you have more than one Internet account, you could create a profile
for each of your accounts, so that you would never need to reset your email identity
or mail and news server addresses or switch your dialer configuration when connecting.</P>

<P>To configure FreePPP with information about your Internet account--what number
you dial to connect, your login and password--you use Account Setup or configure
FreePPP manually. To create and manage profiles and associate them
with account configurations in FreePPP, you use the User Profile Manager, located in the 
Netscape Communicator folder. The User Profile Manager lets you select which Internet account 
you want to connect to when using a specific profile, and from what location you will 
connect</P>

<P>If you share your copy of Communicator with other users, or if you have more than 
one Internet account, read the document entitled "Working with Multiple User Profiles" 
in the Communicator's Reference Library, accessible from the Netscape Communicator folder. That document provides full instructions on 
how to create multiple user profiles and associate them with specific Internet accounts.</P>

<UL>
	<LI>14.4 kbps or faster modem</LI>
	<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	<LI>Open Transport version 1.1.1 or later (1.1.2 recommended), or MacTCP 2.0.6 or

<P>FreePPP is part of a suite of connection software, consisting of the files listed
below. Of these files, you will use FreePPP Dialer most often.</P>

<P>
The Connection Software suite installed with Netscape Communicator includes:
</P>

<UL>
	<LI>FreePPP Dialer (installed in your system's Control Panels folder).</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>FreePPP (installed in your system's Extensions folder).</LI>

<P><A HREF="#contents"><FONT SIZE="2">[CONTENTS]</FONT></A></P>


<A NAME="using"></A> 


<HR size=4 NOSHADE>

<P><B>Using FreePPP</P></B>

<P>When you want to use Netscape Communicator to explore the Internet or send and
receive email, you first need to establish a connection with your Internet account
over your phone line and modem. There are two ways to establish this connection:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Launch Netscape Communicator and link to a page on the web, check your email,
	or read a newsgroup. When needed, Communicator automatically initiates a connection
	to your account.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Open FreePPP and initiate the connection manually
</UL>

<P>Whether the connection is initiated by Communicator or by you, the role of your
connection software, FreePPP, is the same. Once it's told to connect, it dials your
modem, establishes data communication with your Internet service provider's computer,
and even passes along your account login and password, if you wish. </P>

<P>To control the way that FreePPP connects and the number it dials, you use a program
called FreePPP Dialer, installed on your Macintosh as a part of the Netscape Communicator
package. FreePPP Dialer also lets you store dialing information about multiple accounts
that you want to connect to and multiple locations that you connect from. This gives
you quick, automated access to the Internet from anywhere.</P>

<A NAME="connecting"></A>
 
<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>Connecting to Your Account</B></P>

<P>With Netscape Communicator, you don't need to manually launch the FreePPP Dialer program
and connect to the Internet. Instead, Communicator automatically initiates a connection
to your Internet account whenever you request a page from
the web, check your email, or read news. Communicator checks to see if you are connected
to your account. If you aren't, Communicator tells FreePPP to initiate the connection.
This convenient feature is called <B>dial-on-demand</B>. Most likely, you will use
dial-on-demand whenever you connect to the Internet.</P>

<P>However, if you wish to manually initiate a connection to your Internet account
using FreePPP Dialer, you can easily do so.</P>

<P>To manually initiate a connection to your Internet account, follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Launch the FreePPP Dialer program from your system's Control Panels folder.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>From the pop-up menus in the FreePPP Dialer window, select the Account you want
	to connect to, the Location you are connecting from, and the Modem you are using.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Click the Connect button.</LI>
</OL>

<P>When FreePPP begins connecting to your account, it opens the FreePPP Connection
Status dialog, shown here, to inform you of its progress.</P>


<IMG SRC="Images/fppp1.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">


<P>FreePPP Connection Status dialog lets you observe as FreePPP Setup initializes
your modem, dials your account's access number, establishes communication, and provides
your account login name and password to your provider's computer. </P>

<P>When your connection is in place, FreePPP closes the FreePPP Connection Status dialog
box, leaving only the FreePPP Dialer window open, shown below.</P>


<IMG SRC="Images/fppp2.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0">


<P>FreePPP leaves the FreePPP Dialer window open while you are connected for three
reasons:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>To let you know if your connection fails for some reason while you are using
	it. If this happens, reconnect by clicking the Connect button.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>To remind you that you are still connected. All the while you are connected,
	the globe icon in the FreePPP Dialer window spins and the text to the right of the
	Connect button informs you that your connection is still in place.</LI>

<P><B>Customizing FreePPP</P></B>

<P>If you have more than one account or modem, or want to access your account from
more than one location, you can customize FreePPP Dialer. You can store information
about additional accounts, locations, and modems in FreePPP Dialer, so that you can
always connect quickly.</P>

<P>There are two ways to add this information to FreePPP:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Automatically, by using the Account Setup program (for account, location, and
	modem information). If you simply want to change or upgrade the modem you are using,
	you can use the Modem Setup program included with Netscape Communicator.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Manually, using the FreePPP Dialer program (account, location, and modem information).</LI>
</UL>

<P>To use Account Setup to add information about accounts, locations, and modems,
all you have to do is launch Account Setup from the Netscape Communicator folder. The Account Setup screens guide you through the process of adding
the information. You can associate your new information with any Communicator user
profile.</P>

<P>Complete instructions for manually entering information in FreePPP Dialer are
provided in the Help topics that follow. The topics cover many of the most common
customization tasks that you might want to undertake. For more information about
FreePPP Dialer windows and settings, refer to the FreePPP Menus and Windows Help

<A NAME="change_dial"></A>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>Changing the Number that FreePPP Dials</B></P>

<P>When you tell FreePPP to connect to your account, it calculates the number that
it is supposed to dial by referring to information you have entered in the Accounts
and Locations tabs of the FreePPP Dialer expanded window.</P>

<P>First, FreePPP determines whether to dial the area code as part of the dial-up
access number. It does this by comparing the &quot;Area Code&quot; setting in the
Account Configuration Dialog of the Accounts tab--which represents where you are
calling to-- with the &quot;Area Code&quot; setting in the Locations tab--which represents
where you are calling from. If the two area codes match, FreePPP assumes that it
is not necessary to dial the area code when connecting. If the area codes do not
match, FreePPP follows the instructions you provide in the Location Configuration
Dialog. </P>

<P>After determining whether to dial the area code, FreePPP adds any special dialing
instructions to the number it will dial. These might include a dialing prefix, for
accessing an outside line or turning off Call Waiting, a telephone card or credit
card number, and a dialing suffix. These dialing instructions are found in the Location
Configuration Dialog of each dialing location.</P>

<P>You can change the number that FreePPP dials by editing the dialing information
in an account's Account Configuration Dialog or a dialing location's Location Configuration
Dialog.</P>

<P><B>Editing Your Account's Dialing Information</P></B>

<P>When you want to change information about your Internet account's dial-up access
number, edit an the account's Account Configuration Dialog. To do so, follow these
steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>In the FreePPP Dialer expanded window, click the Accounts tab.</LI>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>Changing or Upgrading a Modem</B></P>

<P>FreePPP lets you store information about multiple modems,
so that you can easily control what modem FreePPP will use when dialing to your account.
When you add a new modem or upgrade your modem, you use the Locations tab in the
FreePPP Dialer expanded window to create new dialing modem configurations. If you
upgrade your modem to a faster model, you must create a new modem configuration for
it, otherwise FreePPP won't be able to use the higher speeds your new modem offers.</P>

<P>To create a new modem configuration in FreePPP, you use the Modem Setup program included 
with Netscape Communicator. To use Modem Setup to createa new modem configuration, follow these 
steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Install the new modem according to the manufacturer's instructions.
	Be sure that the modem is properly connected to your computer and that it is turned
	on.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>In the Netscape Communicator folder, double-click the Modem Setup icon.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>When the Modem Setup window opens, the program automatically attempts to identify the modem installed on your computer. </LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>If Modem Setup identifies your modem correctly, click the
	Use This Modem button.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>If Modem Setup incorrectly identifies your modem, click
	the Choose From List button to specify your modem manually. Modem Setup presents you
	with a list of modem manufacturers and a list of modem models and speeds. Select
	your modem manufacturer and model from the lists and click Use This Modem. If your modem
	manufacturer or model isn't displayed in the lists, select the manufacturer &quot;Generic&quot;
	and the model that best approximates the speed of your new modem. Click Use This Modem.</LI>
</OL>

<P>After you finish using Modem Setup, delete any modem configurations that you no
longer need from FreePPP. To delete a modem configuration, follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>In the FreePPP Dialer expanded window, click the Modems tab.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>In the Modems tab, select the configuration you want to delete from the list

<P>The fields in each configuration are described below.</P>

<P>Area code</P>

<P>In the text box, enter the area code of the dial-up access number for the account

<P>Primary and Secondary DNS</P>

<P>In the text boxes, enter the addresses of your provider's primary and secondary
(optional) DNS servers. If you aren't sure about the DNS server addresses, call your

if the account you are connecting to is long distance. Do not include other prefixes
or numbers in this text box. It is for the long distance prefix only.</P>


<P>When you tell FreePPP to connect to your account, it first determines whether to
dial the area code as part of the dial-up access number. It does this by comparing
the &quot;Area code&quot; setting in the Accounts tab--which represents where you
are calling-- with the &quot;Area code&quot; setting in the Locations tab--which
represents where you are calling from. If the two area codes match, FreePPP assumes
that it is not necessary to dial the area code when connecting.</P>

<P>This pop-up menu lets you control what action FreePPP takes if the two area codes
do not match.</P>

<P>Normally, the &quot;Dial long distance prefix before account area code&quot; menu
item would be selected. However, depending on your location, you might want to select
one of the other menu items.</P>

<P><B>Dial prefix</P></B>

<P>In this text box, enter any numbers that FreePPP is to dial before dialing the

<P><B>Modem config name</P></B>

<P>In the text box, enter the name of the modem configuration that you are creating.
If you are editing an existing modem configuration, you can use this box to change
the name of the modem configuration, if you wish. The name you choose appears as
a list item in the Using pop-up menu in the FreePPP Dialer window.</P>

<P><B>Connected to</P></B>

<P>In the pop-up menu, select the port to which your modem is connected. If you aren't
sure, look in the back of your Macintosh. The modem port is marked with a telephone
receiver icon. The printer port is marked with a printer icon.</P>

<P><B>Port speed</P></B>

<P>In the pop-up menu, select the port speed that you want to use when connected.
The port speed should be set as high as possible, but not higher than your Macintosh
and modem are capable of supporting.</P>

<P>The fastest port speed supported for most 14.4 Kbps modems is 57,600 bps. For
28.8K/33.6 Kbps modems, the fastest is 115,200 bps (some support 230,400 bps, but
most do not). Unless you have a Mac with the GeoPort Serial Architecture (Quadra
660AV/840AV or Power Macintosh 6100/7100/7200/7500/7600/8500/9500) or a serial board
capable of supporting faster speeds, do not select a port speed higher than 115,200
bps.</P>

<P><B>Flow control</P></B>

<P>In the pop-up menu, select the method you want to use for handling flow control
(hardware handshaking) between your Macintosh and your modem.</P>

<P>CTS &amp; RTS (DTR) is the most common setting. CTS Only is the second most common
setting.

<P><B>Dial type</P></B>

<P>In the pop-up menu, select whether to use tone or pulse dialing when connecting.
Tone dialing, used by push-button telephones, is suitable for most phone lines. However,
some phone lines still require pulse dialing, an older dialing method used by rotary
telephones.</P>

<P><B>Speaker enabled</P></B>

<P>Check this setting's checkbox if you want your modem's speaker to be turned on
while connecting. (&quot;Checked&quot; recommended)</P>

<P><B>Hang up on disconnect</P></B>

<P>Check this setting's checkbox if you want FreePPP to hang up the phone when a
PPP session ends. (&quot;Checked&quot; recommended)</P>

<P><B>Performa internal modem</P></B>

<P>Check this setting's checkbox if you want to use the sound input channel on a
Performa 5xxx or 6xxx models while online (with an internal Global Village modem).
Note that this option turns off the sound on your modem while the modem is connecting.</P>

<P><B>Long re-dial delay</P></B>

<P>Check this setting's checkbox if you want FreePPP to wait one minute between redial
attempts (if the line that you are trying to connect to is busy). When the checkbox
is not checked, FreePPP attempts to redial after a few seconds.</P>

<P><B>Fast modem initialization</P></B>

<P>Check this setting's checkbox if you don't want FreePPP to pause for one second
after initializing the modem, before starting to dial.</P>

<P>If you are using an internal PowerBook modem or another modem that requires a
delay after initialization, do not check this box.</P>

<P><B>Modem init string settings</P></B>

<P>Select whether you want FreePPP to autodetect your modem's initialization string.
If you want to have FreePPP decide the initialization string, select the &quot;AutoDetect
init string&quot; radio button.</P>

<P>If you want to specify the initialization string manually, select the &quot;Use&quot;
radio button and enter the string your want to use in the text box.</P>

<A NAME="troubleshooting1"></A>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>I'm having trouble connecting to the Internet</B></P>

<P>These tips can help you resolve minor problems:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Make sure your modem is installed, connected properly, and turned on. If you
	are not sure whether your modem is set up correctly, set up your modem using the Netscape Modem Setup tool in the Netscape Communicator folder.</LI>


<P>Make sure that your modem is connected properly. Look in your modem's documentation for details. In general, for <B>external modems</B>, one cable goes from the modem to the telephone wall jack, another cable goes from the modem to the telephone itself, and a third cable goes from the modem to the back of your computer, usually into the modem port (the modem port is sometimes marked by a telephone icon). On some modems, a power cord reaches from the modem to the wall power socket. Make sure all cables and the power cord are plugged in firmly. <P>


<P>Verify that your modem was installed properly. Most <B>internal modems</B> include special software that needs to be installed on your computer. If you are not sure about whether your modem includes special software, look in the owner's manual of your modem. If you aren't sure whether the software is present on your computer, reinstall the software according to the manufacturer's instructions.</P>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>Check to make sure FreePPP Dialer is correctly dialing the phone number of your Internet service provider. You can see the number that FreePPP is dialing in the FreePPP Dialer window. </LI>

<P>If FreePPP Dialer is not dialing correctly, first check to make sure the correct account, location, and modem are selected in the &quot;Connect to:&quot;, &quot;From:&quot;, and &quot;Using&quot; pop-up menus in the FreePPP Dialer window. </P>

<P>Next, open the Locations tab in the FreePPP Dialer expanded window. Select the location you are connecting from and click Edit. Check the phone number and area code and the pop-up menu that tells FreePPP Dialer what to do if the area code of your location doesn't match the area code of your account. Normally, you would select &quot;Dial long distance prefix before account area code&quot; item. </P>

<P>Finally, open the Accounts tab. Select the account you are connecting to and click Edit.  Make sure you entered the phone number and area code correctly.</P>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>If you need to use special dialing prefixes or codes at your location--to turn off Call Waiting or to access an outside line before dialing, for example--be sure that the information is correctly entered for your current location. </LI>

<P>Open the Locations tab in the FreePPP Dialer expanded window. Select the location you are connecting from and click Edit. Check the &quot;Dial prefix&quot; text box. The number you dial to access an outside line should be listed first, followed by a comma. Listed next should be the code you use to turn off Call Waiting, followed by a comma (a comma tells FreePPP Dialer to pause momentarily).</P>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>Make sure that your phone line has a normal dial tone.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>Make sure that no other programs are using your connection software.
</UL>

<P>If your modem is dialing correctly but you can't connect, your provider's server might be busy.</P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>No Dial Tone Present on Telephone Line</B></P>

<P>If your connection software tells you that your phone line doesn't have a dial tone,
here are some tips:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>If you use a voice messaging system provided by a phone company and your modem
	uses your regular phone line, you might need to get your messages before you can
	connect to your Internet account.</LI>


<P>
	Some voice messaging systems alert you to the fact that you have new messages
	by changing the ordinary dial tone of your phone to a &quot;flashing&quot; dial tone
	(an on-off-on-off dial tone). When this happens, your modem, not being able to detect
	an ordinary dial tone, cannot dial out. The solution is to get your new messages.
</P>


<P>
	When you have heard and acted on all of your new messages, your normal, continuous
	dial tone will be restored and you can connect to the Internet.
</P>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>Pick up the receiver of your phone and see if you can hear the dial tone. If
	you can't, then another telephone on the same line might be off the hook, or there
	might be something wrong with your telephone line. </LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>Make sure that your phone line is plugged securely into your modem.</LI>

<P><B>Repeated DNS Errors in Communicator</B></P>

<P>If you have more than one Internet account and are having trouble accessing Web sites or using email because of DNS errors, check to make sure the correct TCP/IP configuration is active in the TCP/IP Control Panel (for systems using Apple's Open Transport networking software only).</P> 

<P>To check the active TCP/IP configuration, follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
<LI>Open your system's TCP/IP Control Panel. </LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>Choose Configurations from the File menu. </LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>Select the configuration you want to use--that of your Internet account--and click Make Active. </LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>Close the TCP/IP Control Panel.</LI>
