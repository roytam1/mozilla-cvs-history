<P><B>Your Modem</B></P>

<P>To enable Account Setup to connect you to the Internet account server, you need to tell it what kind of modem is now connected to your computer.</P>

<P>To specify what modem you are using, follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Select the modem connected to your computer from the pop-up up menu on the screen.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Click Next to move to the next screen.
</OL>

<P>If your modem is not listed in the pop-up menu, follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Make sure that your modem is properly installed, connected, and turned on.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Click the Modem Setup button, below the pop-up menu. (On Windows NT systems, there is no Modem Setup button.)
	
<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
On Windows systems, this opens the Modem Wizard, a tool that will help you specify your modem. Instructions for using the Modem Wizard are provided within that program. 

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
On Macintosh systems, clicking Modem Setup opens the Modem Setup tool. For assistance using Modem Setup, click this link: <A HREF="modwiz.htm">Using Modem Setup</A>.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
		Note that if you are using a Windows NT system, no Modem Setup button appears on this screen, as your modem has already been configured during installation.</LI>
</OL>

<P>On Macintosh systems, an item called "Generic" appears in the pop-up modem menu. You should select this item only if you are unable to specify your modem using Modem Setup. The &quot;Generic&quot; setting enables you to connect to your Internet account, but possibly not at optimal speed. </P>
