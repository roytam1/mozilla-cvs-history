<P><B>More Information</B></P>

<P>This screen displays detailed information about the account plans and special offers available from this Internet Service Provider. Compare this information with the account plans offered by other Internet Service Providers to choose the account that best meets your needs.</P>

<p>Some ISP's support ISDN connections, but you can't create an ISDN account using Account Setup. If an ISP offers ISDN connections, call the listed phone number to find out about ISDN service in your area.</p>

<ul>
<li>To review the account plans offered by other service providers, click "Back".</li>

<li>To establish an account with this service provider, click "Begin Account Creation with this ISP."</li>
</ul>

When you click Begin Account Creation, Account Setup connects to this service provider so you can set up your new account. Once you finish setting up your new account, Account Setup disconnects from the service provider. To begin using your new account right away, exit Account Setup and start Communicator. Communicator uses the account information you provided in Account Setup to connect directly to your new service provider.
