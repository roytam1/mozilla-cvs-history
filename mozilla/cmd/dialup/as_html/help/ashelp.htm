<P><B>What is Account Setup?</B></P>

<P>Account Setup is a tool that helps you quickly set up Communicator to access
the Internet. When you first install Communicator, you can use Account Setup in one of these ways:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>If you're new to the Internet, you can use Account Setup to help you create an Internet account and set up Communicator to access the account.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>If you already have an Internet account, you can use Account Setup to help you quickly set up Communicator to access your account.</LI>
</UL>

<P>Once you've set up Communicator to access your Internet account, you can use Account Setup to create additional Internet accounts. To do this, first use the Communicator's Profile Manager to create a new user profile for the account.</P>

<P>If you share your copy of Communicator with other users, or if you have more than one Internet account, read the document entitled "Working with Multiple User Profiles" in Communicator's Reference Library. The Reference Library is accessible from the Communicator folder or program group. The "Working with Multiple User Profiles" document provides full instructions on how to create multiple user profiles and associate them with specific Internet accounts.</P>

<P>To use Account Setup, follow through its screens and supply the information that Account 
Setup requests. Account Setup uses the information you provide to automatically configure Communicator to access your account. </P>

<P>You can leave Account Setup at any time by clicking Exit in the Account Setup navigation bar.</P>

<P><B>Creating a New Internet Account</B></P>


<P>You can use Account Setup to quickly create a new Internet account. The process takes only a few minutes. All you need to do is follow through the Account Setup screens and enter the information that Account Setup asks you to provide. </P>

<P>After you've entered the information Accoaunt Setup needs, it uses your modem and phone line to temporarily connect you to a computer on the Internet called the Internet account server. The Internet account server is specially designed to provide you with easy access to information about the account plans available to you. You can use the Internet account server to "shop" for an Internet account that meets your needs and then create your new account.</P>

<P>When you are finished using the Internet account server to create your new Internet account, Account Setup disconnects you from the server and configures your computer and Communicator to access the account. Once you've used Account Setup to create your account, you can connect to the Internet just by launching Communicator from the Netscape Communicator folder or program group.</P>

<P>Before you begin using Account Setup, it's very important to make sure your modem is properly installed, connected to your computer and the phone jack, and turned on. Also, make sure that no other communications programs are using your modem when you use Account Setup. The modem must be available to Account Setup.</P>

<P>To use Account Setup to create a new Internet account, follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>If Account Setup isn't open already, launch it by double-clicking its icon in
	the Netscape Communicator folder or program group. If you just finished installing
	Communicator, Account Setup should already be open on your screen. In the welcome
	screen, click the Start Account Setup button.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>The next screen offers you the choice of going straight to Account Setup or viewing
	a short series of introductory screens that illustrate your connection to the Internet
	and how you can use Account Setup. To view the introductory screens, click Next.

	If you don't understand what information Account Setup is asking you to provide or
	aren't sure what action you are supposed to take, click the Help button.</LI>
	
<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>When you reach the last screen of Account Setup, click the Connect Now button

	the Account Setup window. Follow the instructions in the Internet Account Server 
	screens to create an account.</LI>
	
<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>When your account has been successfully created, Account Setup disconnects you from 
	the Internet account server and displays a &quot;Congratulations!&quot; screen. In this 
	screen, click the Save Account Information button if you want to save a record of your 
	account information to a text file on your computer. This includes such information as 
	your login, password, dial-up access number, provider domain name and DNS server 
	addresses, and so on.</LI>
	
<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>To finish using Account Setup, click Done in the navigation bar. Account Setup then 
	automatically sets up Communicator to access your account. Whenever you want to access 
	your account, all you have to do is launch Communicator from the Netscape Communicator 
	folder or program group.</LI>

<P><B>Arranging for Payment to Your Internet Service Provider</B></P>

<P>Internet accounts that you create using Account Setup are paid for by credit card. When Account Setup connects you to your provider's Internet account server, you can arrange for payment by providing your credit card number. Then, when your account is created, your provider automatically bills you each month for your account.This mechanism enables you to create an Internet account and use it right away.</P>

<P>To ensure your privacy, Account Setup scrambles your credit card number before
transmitting it to your provider. Your provider has a unique security key that allows
it to read your credit card number. In addition, Account Setup does not store your
credit card information anywhere on your computer. </P>

<P><B>Specifying What Kind of Modem You Are Using</B></P>

<P>Your modem is an important part of your Internet connection. Before you use Account
Setup, you must install your modem according to the manufacturer's instructions,
connect it properly to your computer and the phone jack, and turn its power switch
on.</P>

<P>Then, when you are using Account Setup, you must specify your modem's manufacturer (for example Hayes, US Robotics, Global Village, and so on) and model (for example, Sportster 28.8, Teleport Gold, Powerport Gold, and so on). This information lets Account Setup configure your connection software properly."</P>

<P>To specify your modem in Account Setup, follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Select the modem you want to use from the pop-up up menu on the Account Setup
	screen.</LI>
	
<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>Click Next to move to the next screen.</LI>
</OL>

<P>If your modem is not listed in the pop-up menu, follow these steps:</P>

<OL>
	<LI>Make sure that your modem is properly installed, connected, and turned on.</LI>
	
<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>Click the Modem Setup button, below the pop-up menu. On Windows systems, this opens the Modem Wizard, a tool that will help you specify your modem. Instructions for using the Modem Wizard are provided within that program. On Macintosh systems, clicking Modem Setup opens the Modem Setup tool. Instructions for using Modem Setup are provided in the next Help topic.</LI>
</OL>

<P>On Macintosh systems, an item called "Generic" appears in the pop-up modem menu. You should select this item only if you are unable to specify your modem using Modem Setup. The &quot;Generic&quot; setting enables you to connect to your Internet account, but possibly not at optimal speed. </P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>I'm having trouble with my modem </B></P>

<P>If Account Setup tells you that there is a problem with your modem, or if your modem won't dial, the problem is probably easy to correct: perhaps the wrong type of modem was specified in the &quot;Your Modem&quot; screen of Account Setup; perhaps the modem was not installed or connected properly or is not turned on. Here are some general tips:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Verify that the power switch of your modem is on. You might even turn the modem off and then on again, just to make sure. </LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

Go to the &quot;Your Modem&quot; screen in Account Setup. Verify that the correct modem type is selected in the pop-up menu. If necessary, look in your modem's documentation to confirm its manufacturer and model name. If your modem is not listed properly in the pop-up menu, click the Modem Detect button to launch Modem Setup, where you can specify your modem manually. </LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>Make sure that your modem is connected properly. Look in your modem's documentation for details. In general, for <B>external modems</B>, one cable goes from the modem to the telephone wall jack, another cable goes from the modem to the telephone itself, and a third cable goes from the modem to the back of your computer, usually into the modem port (the modem port is sometimes marked by a telephone icon). On some modems, a power cord reaches from the modem to the wall power socket. Make sure all cables and the power cord are plugged in firmly. </LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>Verify that your modem was installed properly. Most <B>internal modems</B> include special software that needs to be installed on your computer. If you are not sure about whether your modem includes special software, look in the owner's manual of your modem. If you aren't sure whether the software is present on your computer, reinstall the software according to the manufacturer's instructions.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>If you have checked the other items in this list but are still having modem problems, try selecting the &quot;Generic&quot; item in the Modem Wizard (Windows) or Modem Setup (Macintosh), then use Account Setup again. If this does not help, there might be a problem with your modem itself (the modem isn't operating properly) or with your computer or phone line. Potential problems with phone lines are discussed in the next Help topic.</LI>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>No Dial Tone Present on Telephone Line</B></P>

<P>If your connection software tells you that your phone line doesn't have a dial tone,
here are some tips:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>If you use a voice messaging system provided by a phone company and your modem
	uses your regular phone line, you might need to get your messages before you can
	connect to your Internet account.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	Some voice messaging systems alert you to the fact that you have new messages
	by changing the ordinary dial tone of your phone to a &quot;flashing&quot; dial tone
	(an on-off-on-off dial tone). When this happens, your modem, not being able to detect
	an ordinary dial tone, cannot dial out. The solution is to get your new messages.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	When you have heard and acted on all of your new messages, your normal, continuous
	dial tone will be restored and you can connect to the Internet.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>Pick up the receiver of your phone and see if you can hear the dial tone. If
	you can't, then another telephone on the same line might be off the hook, or there
	might be something wrong with your telephone line. </LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI>Make sure that your phone line is plugged securely into your modem.</LI>

<P><B>Internet</B></P>

<P>The Internet is a worldwide network of public and private computers that cooperate
to exchange information.</P>

<P>Many computers on the Internet are connected permanently together and function
as Internet &quot;hubs.&quot; Millions of people take advantage of Internet services
either by connecting to these hubs directly--as when linked to a corporate or university
network--or by connecting indirectly, using a modem and an ordinary telephone line.</P>

<P>The first step in taking advantage of all that the Internet offers is setting
up an account with an Internet service provider. </P>

<P><B>Internet Service Provider (ISP)</B></P>

<P>An Internet service provider, sometimes called an ISP, is a type of company that
specializes in providing Internet access to individual users. It does this by maintaining
one or more computers with a permanent connection to the Internet, then offering
its customers access to that connection for a fee. </P>

<P>There are a variety of Internet service providers from which to choose--some large
companies, some small, some local companies, some national or even international.
These providers offer their services as packages, or account plans, which vary in
price and payment terms. </P>

<P>The first step in setting up access to the Internet is evaluating the account plans
of the various Internet service providers and selecting the one that best meets your
needs. Account Setup can help you do this.</P>

<P><B>Internet Account</B></P>

<P>An Internet account is your personal access point to the Internet--paid for by
you and registered in your name. You obtain an Internet account from an Internet
service provider, a type of company that maintains a computer with a permanent connection
to the Internet and offers its customers access to that connection for a fee.</P>

<P>When you start an Internet account, your Internet service provider authorizes you
to connect to its computer using your modem and phone line. This connection gives
you access to the World Wide Web, email, newsgroups, realtime audio and conferencing,
chatrooms, file transfer, and other Internet services. Your provider also creates
an email identity for you, so that you can send and receive email messages over the
Internet.</P>

<P>If you don't currently have an Internet account like the one just described, use
Account Setup to start one. Account Setup will let you compare the services and rates
of several top Internet service providers and choose the account plan that best meets
your needs.</P>

<P>On the other hand, if you already have an Internet account and can currently access
the World Wide Web, email, newsgroups, or other Internet services using your computer
and modem, then use Account Setup to help you set up Communicator to access your
existing account.</P>

<P><B>Internet Account Plan</B></P>

<P>An Internet account plan is a package of services offered by an Internet service
provider. All account plans offer access to the Internet for individual users, including
such popular Internet services as the World Wide Web, email, and newsgroups.</P>

<P>Aside from basic Internet services,all account plans are different. Some are designed 
for people who access the Internet infrequently, while others are designed for people who 
spend several hours on the Internet each day.</P>

<P>Account plans differ mainly in:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><B>The phone number you dial to
	connect.</B> 
	Some plans let you connect by dialing a local or regional phone number;
	others, by dialing a toll-free number. Some plans offer many national or international
	connection numbers, so you can connect while travelling. As shown on the previous
	screen, you need to sign up with an Internet service provider before you can connect
	to the Internet and use Communicator.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	<LI><B>Extra services and billing options.</B>
	Some plans include additional services, such as a place where you can publish your
	own Web pages. Some plans are paid for at an hourly usage rate, while others give
	you unlimited connection time for a flat monthly fee. Most plans also include a one-time
	start-up fee, though the amount of the fee varies.</LI>

<P><B>Modem</B></P>

<P>Your modem is a critical part of your dial-up connection. Without it, you could

along the phone line to your Internet service provider. Your Internet service provider
has another modem at its end of the phone line that translates the stream of sounds
back into computer data.</P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P><B>IMAP Server</B></P>

<P>An Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) server is a type of mail server that is offered by some Internet service providers. Like a Post Office Protocol (POP) mail server, an IMAP mail server handles messages coming to you from the Internet.</P>

<P>If you are using an IMAP mail server, you always store your email messages on the server, rather than downloading them all each time you get your mail. When you check your mail, the server downloads only the message headers--subject, sender, date, and so on. When you want to read the message associated with the header, Netscape Messenger retrieves that message individually from the server. </P>

<P>If you are using a POP mail server, you can download all of your messages--including header and content--at once. You can also choose to leave the messages on the server. </P>

<P>Not all Internet service providers offer IMAP mail service. Contact your provider's technical support office if you're not sure whether you can use IMAP mail. In Communicator, you can choose IMAP or POP mail in the Communicator's Mail Preferences.</P>

<P>The advantages and disadvantages of IMAP and POP are described below.</P>

<B>IMAP Mail</B>

<UL>
<LI>Advantages: You can store your messages on the IMAP server, so that you can always get them, no matter where you are retriveing your mail from. When you open
     your inbox, you download message headers only. When you open a message,
     it's then downloaded to your local computer, so startup time is faster.
     Also, because messages are stored on the server, and changes are copied
     back from your local computer, you always have access to an updated
     mailbox.</LI>
     
<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>Disadvantages: Unless you copy your messages to your local computer, if
     your connection to your server goes down while you're working, you must
     reestablish a connection before accessing messages, even though you can
     browse the headers. Connect time can be longer, because you must either
     be connected while you are browsing your messages, or you must
     reconnect every time you access a message you haven't read.</LI>

</UL>

<B>POP Mail</B>

<UL>
<LI>Advantages: Copies messages to your local computer all at once after
     you connect to your server. If your connection goes down while you're
     working, you have your messages.</LI>

<spacer type=vertical size=4>

<LI>Disadvantages: You must synchronize your local inbox with your server's
     mailbox. This can result in downloading new messages over and over (if
     you save your messages on your server), each time you connect, or can
     result in messages residing on computer's you've previously used, but
     to which you may not currently have access. The end result is you are
     sometimes unable to access all your messages when you need to.</LI>
