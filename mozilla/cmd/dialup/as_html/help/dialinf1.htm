<P><B>Dialing Settings for Your Location</B></P>

<P>Enter any of the dialing settings listed on this screen to enable Account Setup to successfully connect with the Internet account server:</P>

<UL>
	<LI><B>The code you dial to turn off Call Waiting</B> (optional): 
	
	<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	If you have Call
	Waiting, you should turn it off while you are connected to the Internet. Calls that come 
	in while you are connected might disturb the connection. 
	
	<spacer type=vertical size=4>

From the pop-up menu on the screen, select the code you use to turn off Call Waiting during a call. If your code isn't listed, enter your code in the text box to the left of the menu. If you have Call Waiting but aren't sure what code to use to turn it off, call your telephone company.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	If you don't have Call Waiting, leave "Line Doesn't Have Call Waiting" selected in the 
	pop-up menu.
	
<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI><B>The number you dial to access an outside line</B> (optional): 
			
	<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	If you are connecting from within an internal phone network, such as from an office building or hotel, enter the number that you dial access an outside line.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	If you don't need to access an outside line before dialing, leave the text box blank.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI><B>Your telephone's dialing method</B> (if applicable):
		
	<spacer type=vertical size=4>

	 Choose either tone or pulse
	dialing. Tone dialing, used by push-button telephones, is suitable for most phone
	lines. However, some phone lines still use pulse dialing, the older method used by
	rotary telephones.
