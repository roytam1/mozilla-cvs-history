<P><B>Your Provider's Domain Name and DNS Servers</B></P>

<P>Enter your provider's domain name and the internet addresses of your provider's DNS servers into the text boxes:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Domain Name: Your provider's domain name is the internet identity of your provider's network of computers. It often looks something like <TT>providername.com</TT> or <TT>providername.net</TT>. 

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Primary and Secondary DNS Servers: Your provider's Domain Name System (DNS) servers route your email, requests for web pages, and other Internet traffic to their proper destinations on the Internet. The secondary DNS server is a backup to the primary server, in case the primary server goes offline or a part of the network is unavailable for some reason. 
</UL>

<P>Unlike the mail and news server information on the previous screen, Account Setup <B>must</B> have your provider's domain name and DNS server address before you can access the Internet. If you don't have this information or are unsure about the information
that you do have, call your provider before going on with Account Setup.</P>
