<P><B>Your Email Login and Password</B></P>

<P>Many Internet service providers let you use your account login name and
password to access your email. That way, you only have a single login and password to remember. Other providers, though, ask you to use a different login
and password for accessing email.</P>

<P>If your provider has given you a special login and password for email, enter them
into the appropriate text boxes. Account Setup configures Communicator's Mail & Groups preferences with the information you enter on this screen. </P>

<P>Account Setup automatically enters your account login and password into the text boxes on this screen. If you use a different login and password for email, enter the information into this screen. If you aren't sure whether you need a special email login and password, or aren't sure what yours is, call your provider's technical support office.</P>
