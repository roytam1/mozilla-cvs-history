<P><B>Your Web Page Publishing Location</B></P>

<P>If your Internet account includes a place on your provider's server where you
can publish and view your Web pages, enter those locations in the text boxes in the
Account Setup screen:

<UL>
	<LI>Publish URL: Enter the URL (web address) of the location on your provider's servers where you publish your own web pages. (for example, http://www.netscape.com/~user/publish/). Note that this is not the location that you enter into a web browser to view the pages (see View URL, below). 

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Publish password: Most providers ask you to provide a password before you can publish your files on their web servers. Many times, your publishing password is the same as your account password. Enter the publishing password given to you by your provider.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>View URL. Enter the URL (web address) where you or others can view web pages that you've published (for example, http://www.netscape.com/~user/).
</UL>

<P>If you aren't sure if your account includes a place where you can publish your web pages, or if you aren't sure of the URLs for publishing or viewing the pages or your password, call your provider's technical support office.</P>

<P>If you don't want to enter this information now, you don't need to. You can enter it after you're done using Account Setup, in Communicator's Editor preferences.</P>
