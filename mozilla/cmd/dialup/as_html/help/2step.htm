<P><B>Connect to this ISP to Begin Creating Your Account</B></P>

<P>You're ready to connect to this ISP to create your Internet account.</P>

<p>When you click "Connect," Account Setup calls the ISP so you can begin the account creation process. Once your new account is created, you can begin using it right away.</P>

<p>The ISP will ask you for your billing information, including your name, address, and credit card number. Your credit card will only be charged by the ISP if you go through the entire account creation process.</p>

<P><b>Note:</b>  If you encounter problems or have questions during the account creation process, call the ISP's customer support number for assistance.</P>

<p>After you complete the account creation process and exit from Account Setup, you can begin using your new account by starting Communicator.</p>
