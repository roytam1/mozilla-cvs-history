<P><B>Your Billing Information</B></P>

<P>Internet accounts that you create using Account Setup must be paid for by credit card. Account Setup assists you by forwarding the credit card information you provide on the screen to your provider. This mechanism enables you to create an Internet account and use it right away.

<P>To ensure the privacy of your credit card information, Account Setup scrambles your credit card number before transmitting it to your provider. Your provider has a unique security key that allows it to read your credit card number. In addition, Account Setup does not store your credit card information anywhere on your computer.</P>

<P>Use the text boxes and pop-up menus to specify your credit card type, its number,
and its expiration date:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Name on card: Your name as it appears on your credit card.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Type of card: The type of card you're using. You can use American Express, Discover,
	MasterCard, or VISA.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Card number: The card number as it appears on the card.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Expiration date: The expiration date that appears on the card.
