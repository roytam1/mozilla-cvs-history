<P>Depending on your Internet service provider, you might not need to enter all of this information--your Internet service provider might have already supplied Account Setup with some of it. Account Setup asks only for the information not supplied by your provider.</P>

<P>You can probably find the information that you need to provide in the forms given to you by your provider when you started your account. If you don't have the information you need,
call your provider's technical support office.</P>

<P>If you aren't sure about what to enter into an Account Setup screen, click the
Help button.</P>
