<P><B>Connect to Server</B></P>

<P>You've finished entering the information that Account Setup needs to connect you to the Internet account server. Click Connect Now to connect to the Internet account server, where you can learn about the account plans available and
create a new Internet account.</P>

<P>When you click Connect Now, Account Setup uses your modem, phone line, and the connection software installed with Communicator to initiate a connection with the Internet account server. For this reason, your modem must be properly installed and turned on, and your phone line must be available to Account Setup.</P>

<P>After Account Setup successfully connects, it loads the Internet account server screens in the Account Setup window. Follow the instructions on the Internet account server screens to learn about account plans available and create an account. Help is also available from the Internet account server screens.</P>

<P>When evaluating account plans, it helps to have some idea of how you will be using the Internet:
<UL>
	<LI>Will you always connect from home or will you also connect while traveling? Some plans offer a toll-free access number for travelers. Others offer a selection of many local access points so that you can always connect, wherever you are. However, these services might cost extra.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>How many hours will you spend on the Internet each month? Some plans are designed for people who connect less often, letting you pay by the hour for Internet access. Other plans are designed for people who connect every day, giving you unlimited hours of connection time for a flat monthly fee. 

</UL>

<P>Once you have chosen an account plan and created an account, Account Setup disconnects you from the Internet account server. It then automatically configures your computer to access your new account. 

<P>If you don't want to connect to the Internet account server right now, you don't need to. Account Setup saves the information you provided (except your credit card number), so that when you are ready to create an account, all you have to do is launch Account Setup and move to this screen to connect.</P>
