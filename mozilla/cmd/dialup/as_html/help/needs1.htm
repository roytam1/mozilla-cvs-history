<P><B>Preparing to Create a New Account</B></P>

<P>To use Account Setup to create a new Internet account, you need to provide the following information:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Your name, address, and telephone number.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>A credit card number for billing.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Your modem manufacturer and model.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>The phone number of the phone line at the location you are connecting from.

<spacer type=vertical size=4>
	
	<LI>Any special dialing settings specific to the location you are connecting from--to turn off Call Waiting, access an outside line, or use pulse dialing.
</UL>

<P>To help you create a new account, Account Setup uses your modem, telephone line, and the connection software installed with Communicator to connect you to the Internet account server. The Internet account server presents you with specific information about account plans available to you, so that you can select the account plan that best meets your needs. </P>

<P>In the next few screens, Account Setup asks you to enter the information it needs to connect you to the Internet account server. If you aren't sure about what information to enter in an Account Setup screen, click the Help button in the Account Setup navigation bar. </P>

<P>When you have provided the information that Account Setup needs, Account Setup connects you to the Internet account server.</P>
