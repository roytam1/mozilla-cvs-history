<P ID="smallleftmargin">As you saw on the previous screen, you need an account with an Internet service provider before you can connect to the Internet and use Communicator. </P>

<P ID="smallleftmargin">An Internet service provider, sometimes called an ISP, is a company that specializes in providing Internet access to individual users who connect using  their phone lines and modems. It maintains a permanent connection to the Internet, then lets its customers access that connection for a fee. </P>

<P ID="smallleftmargin">If you don't yet have an account with an Internet service provider, you can use Account Setup to create one right away. Account Setup lets you compare the account plans available to you and create an Internet account right away.</P>
