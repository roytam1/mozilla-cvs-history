<P ID="smallleftmargin">If you don't yet have an Internet account, you can use Account Setup to find out about the account plans available and sign up for the one that best meets your needs. </P>

<P ID="smallleftmargin">When you sign up, you are creating an Internet account in your name that gives you access to the World Wide Web, email, newsgroups, and other services offered in your account plan. Your provider gives you a unique user name, password, and email identity for your account. Account Setup automatically sets up Communicator with this information so that you can access your account immediately.</P>

<P ID="smallleftmargin">If you already have an Internet account, you can use Account Setup to quickly set up Communicator to access your account. To find out more,
