# Categorization rules for spacetrace
#
# This file defines the stack frame rules that will categorize
# allocations that spacetrace processes. The format of this file is
#
#       <categoryname>
#       substring for stack frame n
#       substring for stack frame n+1
#       substring for stack frame n+2
#
# The key in the matching rule is that for every rule, we provide a
# snippet of the stack frame - contiguous substring matches.
# categorynames and rules substring matches are case sensitive
#
# Predefined Categories
# "All"           - All allocations [default]
# "uncategorized" - All allocations that dont match any category
