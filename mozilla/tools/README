mozilla/tools
=============

This directory is for miscellaneous tools associated with mozilla.

Table of Contents
=================

* trees.pl (a.k.a moz)
    A perl script to navigate mozilla source trees.
    Run trees -h for usage. You will probably need to copy 'trees' into
    your home directory somewhere (Just be careful to keep it up to date).
    You wrap 'trees' in a shell alias called 'moz' to let you do things like,
      moz gecko webshell   - cd to webshell directory in gecko tree
      moz gecko2           - cd to same directory in gecko2 tree
      moz /                - cd to the root of the tree
      moz -o               - cd to the same subdir in the object directory


* mozilla/tools/build
    This directory is for tools that facilitate the building of the
    mozilla source code (the browser, the sdks, etc.).

* mozilla/tools/project-editor
    CGI interface to Machintosh Project Editor

* mozilla/tools/tests
    <synopsis: write me>

* mozilla/tools/tinderbox
    Scripts associated with the client-side of tinderbox.
    (scripts to checkout, build, and report the status of the tree to a
     tinderbox server.)
