# Usage (Linux only for now):
#
# Do your normal Mozilla build, preferably a clobber one since
# that tends to give you more accurate .deps/*.pp files.
#
# cd objdir
# requires-cleanup.pl > req.diff
#
# The objdir is the directory where you ran |make| to build Mozilla
#
# Currently needs File::List
# http://www.cpan.org/modules/by-module/File/File-List-0.1.tar.gz
# We can probably get rid of this dependency

# If you can't place File::List in your perl library path,
# point this to where you've placed File::List:
# use lib "/home/jag/utils/";
