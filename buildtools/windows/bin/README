Building NSPR on Windows NT Using Netscape's gmake and Other Tools

This directory contains the following tools:
- gmake.exe: GNU make 3.74, modified to use shmsdos.exe as the shell
- shmsdos.exe: a lightweight shell developed by Netscape programmers.
      It has most of the file manipulation operations (such as cp,
      rm, mkdir as well as Netscape's own nsinstall) as built-in
      commands, so even if you have these
      file utilities installed on your NT machine, they won't be invoked
      by gmake and shmsdos.  Also, since shmsdos is not a full-blown
      shell and its built-in file commands are not fully compatible
      with the true Unix file utilities, our makefiles have had to
      avoid some features of sh and work around the incompatibilities
      on Windows NT.
- uname.exe: this uname.exe returns the OS as "WINNT", which is what
      our makefiles assume.  Do not use a uname.exe that returns other
      strings, such as "Windows_NT".

Binaries for the x86 processors can be found in the 'x86' subdirectory.
Binaries for the alpha processors can be found in the 'alpha'
subdirectory.

INSTALLATION:

Install gmake.exe, shmsdos.exe, and uname.exe in any directory.
Add that directory to your Path environment variable.
