This directory contains the source files for shmsdos.exe and
nsinstall.exe, which are used in conjunction with gmake.exe
to build some components of the Mozilla client on Win32.

The tool shmsdos.exe is a very lightweight shell.  It is
the default shell for our gmake.exe.  shmsdos.exe implements
several common Unix utilities as built-in commands, such as
mv, cp, rm, echo, mkdir, etc.  It only implements very
limited shell features.  It can do if-then-else and for loops,
but it can't do variables, pipes, standard I/O redicrection, etc.

It is possible to use a real Bourne shell with our gmake.exe
by defining the SHELL variable in your makefiles.  Our gmake.exe
works with the Korn shell (sh.exe) of MKS Toolkit.  If you go
this route, you will also need nsinstall.exe.  (nsinstall is
a built-in command for shmsdos.exe.) 

To build shmsdos.exe, you need Microsoft Visual C++ and nmake.
Just issue the command:
    nmake /f shmsdos.mak
The output is Release\shmsdos.exe.  Copy it to a directory on
your Path.

To build nsinstall.exe, issue the command:
    nmake /f nsinstall.mak
The output is Release\nsinstall.exe.  Copy it to a directory
on your Path.
